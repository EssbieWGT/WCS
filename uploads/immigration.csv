In 2021, the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center filed a lawsuit in state claims court to challenge a decades-old ruling that prevents undocumented workers who were hurt on the job from filing for wage-loss benefits.

His statement Oct. 6 came as hundreds of California National Guardsmen are in limbo at a Portland military base as Trump and Democratic leaders wage a feverish legal battle over his attempts to deploy soldiers in American cities.

Trump ordered the Oregon Guard late last month to move into Portland, but local leaders sued and a federal judge temporarily halted the deployment. Then Trump deployed California and Texas Guard troops, but the Oregon judge stopped all federal troops from entering.

A similar standoff also was unfolding in Chicago.

Here's what to know about the National Guard deployments.

Trump's Portland deployment sets up of legal fight

Trump's first attempt to go after Portland demonstrators was Sept. 28: he ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the region for an initial 60 days, according to court documents.

The troops, he said, would ""protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"" and would use ""Full Force, if necessary,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post.

After Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, filed suit, a federal judge suspended the deployment Oct. 4.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled the deployment was unnecessary because the demonstrations did not amount to a ""rebellion,"" and law enforcement was capable of handling the protests without military intervention.

National Guard Whac-A-Mole

The Trump administration then took up a new strategy: switch states.

Hours after the judge barred the Oregon troops, he tapped California guardsmen to take on the same job. Early Oct. 5, about 100 California National Guard troops arrived at the Portland Air National Guard base, followed by another 99 guardsmen that afternoon, according to court documents. That prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to join Kotek's lawsuit in an attempt to take back control of his state's troops.

The administration also ordered 400 members of the Texas National Guard to ""perform federal protection missions where needed, including in the cities of Portland and Chicago,"" according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Hegseth's order to the Texas National Guard – which came with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's permission – notably left open that the troops could be deployed ""where needed.""

Immergut then issued an order temporarily halting all federal National Guard deployments to Portland.

Trump appealed that ruling Oct. 6, seeking to wrest control of those troops.

Joseph Nunn, a legal expert at the Brennan Center who specializes in National Guard deployments, said at the heart of Immergut's ruling was ""whether the facts on the ground justify deploying troops.""

""The fundamental problem for the Trump administration in Portland is that what they are saying is happening in Portland simply isn’t true,"" Nunn said.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said of Immergut's ruling: ""With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.""

""The ICE facility has been really under siege by these anarchists outside,"" Leavitt said. ""We are very confident in the president's legal authority to do this.""

'Chipocalypse now'

While the battle over Portland played out, Trump also ordered 300 Illinois National Guardsmen into Chicago on Oct. 4. He had also threatened an Illinois deployment in taunting comments and social media posts, including one that read ""Chipocalypse now"" in a reference to the Vietnam War-era film ""Apocalypse Now"" that depicted Trump in the foreground as the lieutenant colonel from the movie with helicopters flying over a burning Chicago skyline behind him.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, sued Oct. 6 to stop the deployment.

""Let me be clear – Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation's cities,"" Pritzker said at a news conference.

Trump deploys military to multiple cities

The Trump administration also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, earlier this year. Both deployments drew similar lawsuits from Democratic leaders.

In the nation's capital, more than 2,000 troops from the city's own National Guard force and other states have been deployed since mid-August. Those troops also have been assigned to pick up trash and help out with soup kitchens, among other ""beautification"" projects. Brian Schwalb, the city's attorney general, filed suit in early September to end the deployment.

The Trump administration sent about 5,000 California National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to control possible violence amid demonstrations against a wave of deportations. All but a few hundred of the soldiers – some of whom were sent to Portland over the weekend – have gone home.

A judge later ruled the deployment was illegal and violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids National Guard members acting on federal orders from carrying out law enforcement functions. The Trump admistration is appealing that ruling.

Trump also has deployed troops to fight crime in Memphis, Tennessee – with the consent of the state's Republican governor – and to assist immigration enforcement agents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump's use of National Guard called 'unprecedented'

Nunn, from the Brennan Center, said Trump's wielding of the National Guard is ""unprecedented in American history.""

""The president seems to want the U.S. military to spend a lot more time pointing their weapons at Americans than defending Americans,"" he said. ""That is a dramatic shift from how we have always done things in the United States.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/30/USAT/86446760007-2230417719.jpg?crop=5081,2859,x0,y264&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-07 17:57:55.211966

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

It’s time for our lawmakers and politicians to listen to their constituents. Immigration should remain a vital part of the U.S. past, present, and future.",https://ips-dc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/americans-dislike-Trumps-immigration-agenda.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:57:35.132228

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi.
In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history.
The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.
“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.","Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, sparred on Tuesday with Democratic senators who demanded answers on her involvement in Donald Trump’s crackdown on political opponents, deployment of national guard troops to cities nationwide and handling of the Epstein files.

The clashes at an annual Senate judiciary committee hearing come after months of allegations from the Democrats that Trump has compromised the justice department’s traditional independence and instead used it to bring charges for political reasons.

Federal prosecutors have indicted the former FBI director James Comey, while a reported federal investigation of Tom Homan, the “border czar”, was dropped after Trump took office. Meanwhile, the president has continued to deploy national guard troops into Democratic-led jurisdictions for missions billed as fighting crime and safeguarding immigration agents, over the objections of local leaders.

Throughout the five-hour hearing, Bondi declined to talk about many of the administration’s controversial decisions, despite persistent questioning from the Democrats. When pressed, she personally attacked several senators from the minority or invoked the ongoing government shutdown to depict them as negligent.

“You voted to shut down the government, and you’re sitting here. Our law enforcement officers aren’t being paid,” Bondi replied when the committee’s top Democratic senator, Dick Durbin of Illinois, questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for sending the national guard into Chicago.

“I wish you love Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” she continued, adding: “If you’re not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will.”

In his opening statement, Durbin described Bondi as doing lasting damage to the department tasked with enforcing federal law.

“What has taken place since January 20, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” he said.. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi. In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain in American history. It will take decades to recover.”

Of particular concern to Democrats were the charges against Comey, which came after Trump publicly called on Bondi to indict his enemies and fired a veteran prosecutor who refused to bring the case.

The attorney general avoided talking about the indictment, saying it was a “pending case”, but argued it was approved by “one of the most liberal grand juries in the country”.

She was similarly dismissive of questions about the closing of the Homan investigation, in which he was said to have promised immigration-related federal contracts in return for $50,000 from an undercover FBI agent.

“The Department of Justice and the FBI conducted a thorough review, and they found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said. She also refused to discuss the legal rationale behind the Trump administration’s attacks on boats allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

When Democratic senators became persistent, Bondi responded with critiques and allegations of hypocrisy. Durbin asked the attorney general why she had said earlier this year there was a list of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s clients “sitting on my desk”, only for the justice department to announce no such document existed.

“If you listen to my entire clip on that, I said I had not reviewed it yet,” she said.

Durbin then asked Bondi why there was no signature on a July memo from her department saying it had determined that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and no further details about his case would be made public.

“Did you take money from Reid Hoffman, campaign donations, who was a huge Epstein friend?” Bondi replied.

Hoffman is a billionaire venture capitalist who donates to Democrats. He has acknowledged and apologized for collaborating with Epstein on fundraising, but denied being one of his clients.

“Eventually, you’re going to have to answer for your conduct,” Durbin warned. “You won’t do it today, but eventually you will.”

After saying he was concerned about the politicization of the justice department, Senator Alex Padilla got into a back and forth with Bondi. He called for order, prompting Bondi to invoke a June incident where Padilla was briefly handcuffed at a Los Angeles press conference by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

“You sure didn’t have order when you stormed secretary Noem,” the attorney general said.

The ugliest exchanges came during questioning from Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California and longtime Trump foe, who the administration recently accused of mortgage fraud.

As he sought details from Bondi on the handling of the Homan investigation, the attorney general said: “If you worked for me, you would have been fired, because you were censured by Congress for lying.”

Schiff, a former representative, was censured in 2023 by the Republican-led House of Representatives for his involvement in Trump’s first impeachment.

Republican senators generally spoke positively of Bondi, or used their questioning to ask how she would address specific criminal justice issues. Several expressed anger over a report published on Monday that Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed during Joe Biden’s presidency to prosecute Trump, obtained data of nine lawmakers’ phone calls.

“I’ve heard them say that Joe Biden never targeted his political enemies,” Republican senator Josh Hawley said of the Democrats. “Huh? That’s interesting, because I could have sworn that yesterday we learned that the FBI tapped my phone.”

Smith’s cases against the president ended when he won re-election last year. His report into the prosecutions mentions communications between senators and an unnamed co-conspirator, and notes that the justice department’s public integrity section was consulted during the investigation to ensure they did not run afoul of specific protections the law affords to members of Congress.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6426e93a01b83337d36da9b73f1b82c59486bd/447_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8d1b4633e819917617db84bf443d5b8",N,,2025-10-07 16:57:27.377333

It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration.","In an effort to weaponize an agency that provides pathways to legal immigration, the Trump administration is arming the United States Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) for the first time since the agency was created.

Under new regulations published in September, USCIS special agents will be allowed to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search and arrest warrants. This is the latest effort in Donald Trump’s agenda to systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status. The administration’s goal is to redeploy as many parts of the federal government as possible to serve a mass deportation system that will detain and remove as many people as possible.

USCIS is Not an Immigration Enforcement Agency

USCIS is a federal agency that oversees lawful immigration. It decides whether to grant immigration applications and petitions, including applications for green cards, work authorization, asylum, citizenship, and more.

Before USCIS was created, one agency was responsible for most aspects of U.S. immigration law, including carrying out immigration enforcement and deciding immigration benefits. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, it separated these duties into three separate agencies: USCIS was created to focus exclusively on deciding immigration benefits, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were charged with law enforcement duties. Congress deliberately separated these functions to allow USCIS to more efficiently and effectively adjudicate immigration benefits, stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not recombine these functions in one agency.

Keeping USCIS separate from ICE and CBP also helped to ensure that people felt comfortable coming forward and applying for immigration benefits. By blurring these lines, the Trump administration is hoping to make it harder and more intimidating for people to apply for and obtain benefits that they are eligible for under U.S. law. This move will also redirect USCIS resources away from deciding whether to grant immigration benefits, and towards supporting ICE. Applications and petitions will languish and processing times will increase. All of this is by design—this administration intentionally keeps immigrants in more vulnerable immigration statuses to limit their rights and make it easier to deport them.

Trump Weaponizes Federal Agencies for Mass Deportations

The Trump administration is using this new rule to bypass Congress and turn USCIS into another arm of ICE. It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration. For example, USCIS has announced several new policies that, if implemented, will make it harder for qualified immigrants to access citizenship and may stall naturalizations on a large scale. The agency has also instituted hurdles for naturalized citizens seeking to register to vote. Under another new policy, USCIS will deny benefits to people it decides may support “anti-American” ideologies or activities.

Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has weaponized agency after agency to carry out his mass deportation agenda. For example, the Department of Justice stated it would prioritize stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans. The administration has co-opted the military: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has deployed members of the military and used Department of Defense resources for immigration enforcement. ICE has aggressively recruited local police and sheriffs, convincing over one thousand department leaders to forgo local safety priorities and become an arm of its deportation machine. DHS has even deputized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers to help immigration enforcement, and attempted to force the IRS as well as Medicare and Medicaid to share information with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes.

USCIS Policy Changes Undermines Citizenship and Silences Immigrants

Turning USCIS into an enforcement agency is another blatant attempt to stigmatize and harm people who are immigrants—including long-time residents who are American in every way, but on paper. USCIS’s recent policy changes undermine the very bedrock of our democracy by keeping people from seeking legal status and citizenship. If immigrants cannot access citizenship and other immigration benefits, we risk having an underclass of people subject to the whims of this administration’s loyalty tests and able to be exploited. Just look at Miller’s plans to deprive noncitizen children of education and deny citizenship to American-born children.

The Trump administration is erasing our history as a nation of immigrants and attempting to rewrite what it means to be an American by intimidating immigrants, pushing them into the shadows, and silencing dissenters.

These attacks are a reminder that our undocumented neighbors and loved ones deserve a path to citizenship. They are raising families, paying taxes, and working to make our nation thrive.

In 2021, Texas immigration attorney Adam A. Malik had his phone seized by border agents.","Last week, attorney Andrew Lattarulo was on his way home from Aruba when his iPhone 15 Pro Max was seized by Homeland Security and Border Control agents at Boston Logan International Airport. Perhaps un-coincidentally, Lattarulo is a well-known immigration in the Boston area — his clients include the father of a 4-month old whose arrest by ICE drew public scrutiny — and has a popular social media presence that calls out problematic practices of immigration agents and is critical of Donald Trump’s policies.

As a result, he filed a lawsuit alleging violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights. Lattarulo also filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order blocking the search of his phone and its return, as it contains confidential client information, as well as privileged information between himself and other attorneys. As stated in the motion, “The seizure was made eight hours after plaintiff had been inspected by United States Customs and Border Protection at a border crossing. Plaintiff’s phone was unlawfully seized and most likely searched in violation of plaintiff’s First and Fourth Amendments, and the constitutional rights of his clients.”

District of Massachusetts Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted the TRO, barring the government from searching the phone or analyzing any data that may have already been collected.

Lattarulo’s attorneys, Mary Lemay and Patrick Hanley from Butters Brazilian, said, “We believe attorney Lattarulo was targeted because he represents clients in immigration-related proceedings, and he has amplified the government’s own enforcement priorities via social media to immigrant communities and anyone else who might be interested.”

“Public criticism of our government is protected speech under the First Amendment. We initiated this suit to protect not only attorney Lattarulo’s constitutional rights, but also those of his clients.”

But this early success may not translate to ultimate victory. In 2021, Texas immigration attorney Adam A. Malik had his phone seized by border agents. The Fifth Circuit ruled DHS’s use of a filter team to sort out any privileged materials was sufficient to protect Malik’s clients, and that the government’s asserted connection between the attorney and an arms dealer created probable cause even if Malik is correct that the connection “appears dubious in hindsight.”",https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/GettyImages-2213399102-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:02.634050

The governor said she once again stated that there isn't an insurrection in the state, and pointed to the military in Portland.

""I reiterated that I continue to be focused on doing whatever I can to protect Oregonians from military intervention or harmful federal law enforcement tactics,” Gov. Kotek said. You can read her full statement below.

Shortly before her arrival, the Portland Police Bureau closed off streets surrounding the ICE building at South Macadam Avenue and Bancroft Street.

The police bureau said the closure would be temporary for a ""dignitary visit,"" and that people should avoid the area in the south waterfront and plan alternate routes.

Our news crews and others in the area say there were no arrests made when police closed off the blocks around the building.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Mayor Keith Wilson's office said they received notice of her visit, but did not provide additional details about the visit.

Sec. Noem's motorcade left the airport at about noon.

Conservative commentator Benny Johnson posted on his Instagram early this morning that he is coming to interview Noem at the ICE facility in South Portland.

Johnson posted on X a video of her arrival at the facility:

You can read the statement from the City of Portland below:

""We are aware that Secretary Noem is visiting the Portland area. Although the City received notice of her visit, we do not have full details about her agenda.

In the interest of public safety, Portland Police will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary. This protects our community, by making sure our roads and public spaces stay safe.

Consistent with Portland’s sanctuary city status, our local police will not support any federal immigration enforcement activities.

We urge Portlanders to continue to remain safe. Recent court decisions have affirmed that Portland does not need federal military intervention, and that our local public-safety approach stands on firm legal ground.""

Oregon Senator Ron Wyden issued a statement talking about Sec. Noem visiting Portland:

“Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official. In reality, she's been sent by Trump to incite violence. Don't tar and feather her as Speaker Johnson suggested for Governor Newsom. The best response to her playacting as cop? Ignore her and keep supporting the members of our community.”

Oregon Gov. Kotek issued the following statement after meeting with Secretary Noem:

“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland. I was clear that I have confidence in local law enforcement to meet the moment.

“I requested that Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents obey Oregon laws when they engage in federal operations. I reiterated that I continue to be focused on doing whatever I can to protect Oregonians from military intervention or harmful federal law enforcement tactics. Oregon is united against military policing in our communities.”

A Trump-appointed federal judge has temporarily blocked a deployment to Oregon, which was meant to respond to protests at Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings, while a lawsuit plays out. But a Chicago-based judge appointed by former President Joe Biden declined to immediately halt the Illinois mobilization in a Monday afternoon hearing.

The Trump administration has argued that protests outside of ICE facilities necessitate additional security, while city and state officials have said the demonstrations are largely peaceful and expressed concern that soldiers could escalate tensions.

Hearst Newspapers reached out to top Texas leaders, local officials and the state’s entire congressional delegation to ask whether they support the deployment of the Texas National Guard in this case. Read their responses below.

...

President Trump does not have the authority to deploy the Texas National Guard other than under specific circumstances: invasion, rebellion, or if 'the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.' There is simply no evidence that is the case now in any state in the United States. It is utterly inconsistent with the principles of freedom and self-determination that Texans celebrate for Governor Abbott to go along with weaponization and attempted politicization of the United States military against our fellow Americans. I urge Governor Abbott not to support the deployment of Texas National Guard to Oregon or to any other state for domestic policing purposes, especially as our Texas National Guard is still assisting in the ongoing recovery and relief efforts in the Hill Country and is needed here at home.

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call.
From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.
“By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.” The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles.
There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.” This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor.","Back in June, Chiland, a Los Angeles public-school teacher, heard rumors that National Guard troops were being marshalled on Terminal Island in preparation to arrest anti-ICE demonstrators across the city. This inspired Chiland and his wife, Maya Suzuki Daniels, to co-found the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, a group of community activists that track the movements of immigration authorities around Los Angeles. “I came down here to check on that, because we wanted to let people know,” Chiland told me. He didn’t find any National Guard members that day, but “what I did see was a convoy of eleven vehicles”—some labelled Border Patrol, others unmarked, with tinted windows—leaving the federal complex and heading for the city. The next morning, another member of the newly established Peace Patrol returned to check if the Border Patrol convoys were back. They were. “We’ve been seeing them every day since,” he said. Today was day ninety-one.

By six-thirty, the Peace Patrollers were standing along the shoulder of Seaside Avenue. Maldonado, a Los Angeles-area workers-compensation hearing representative, distributed green reflective vests (“so they can’t say they didn’t see us”), and the group got to work. Four of the Patrollers whipped out their cellphones to photograph each passing vehicle, while Chiland managed the Peace Patrol’s Instagram account—a vital tool for broadcasting information and communicating with the public. Maldonado held tally clickers in each hand (one for inbound traffic to the federal complex, one for outbound) and counted the flow of vehicles. “We’ll get around a hundred to a hundred and thirty cars per day,” he told me. An S.U.V. and a sedan drove by. Click. Click. “If we get an influx of cars, that lets me know that there’s a lot of activity going on in L.A.” The busiest day since the Patrol started recording was in August, when three hundred and five vehicles passed through. He laughed: “We’ll tell our grandkids that we defeated fascism with six-dollar clickers.”

With the images they capture at Terminal Island, the Peace Patrol and Unión del Barrio, an affiliated community-activist organization, compare vehicles with those that appear at immigration raids throughout the region. Some vehicles logged at Terminal Island by the group have been spotted as far away as Ventura, and even Sacramento. Once a license plate has been confirmed as that of a federal agent by appearing both at Terminal Island and at an immigration-enforcement raid, the Peace Patrol will post an image of the plate and the vehicle to the group’s Instagram account. In a few instances, “we’ve seen one license plate on two different vehicles,” Maldonado said. Other times, a temporary paper license plate has been used to obscure known plates.

“Exposure is not something that ICE wants,” Tim McOsker, a Los Angeles City Council member whose district covers Terminal Island, explained to me in a phone call. McOsker has been a valuable resource for the Patrollers, and his wife has volunteered with the group. “When you are engaged in a systematic, unconstitutional activity where you’re trying to grab as many people in your net as possible, you do not want cameras.” The agents flowing through Terminal Island seem to agree. According to the Peace Patrol, after three months and dozens of confirmed vehicles and plates, certain cars are known to the Patrollers and have nicknames, like Christopher Columbus, Big Red, and Jammer. The federal agents have become aware of the Patrollers, too. Some agents will attempt to hide their faces as they pass—what the patrollers have dubbed the shy shoulder. Others will try to disguise their unmarked cars with things like a “COEXIST” bumper sticker (nickname: “Captain Coexist”) or Teddy bears on the dashboard. Still others will get aggressive. “We’ve been swerved at, we’ve had cars rip down the street at seventy, eighty miles per hour,” said Cait Bartlett, another former L.A. public-school teacher. Not long after, a large pickup truck known to the group rolled by, its horn blaring at the patrollers as the driver flashed his middle finger. “They’re trying to be intimidating,” Bartlett continued. “So, there is a little bit of nervousness attached to it, but I know the work that we’re doing is important.”

A month earlier, that intimidation had boiled over. On the morning of August 8th, two masked men leaving the federal complex exited their vehicle and targeted one of the Patrollers, Amanda Trebach, who was photographing cars and holding a protest sign. She was pinned to the ground, handcuffed, and thrown into a van. Then, as Trebach recounts, the agents drove her into the complex, where she was detained for several hours. Later, she was moved into a second vehicle by masked, armed men (including one of the men who had arrested her), where a special agent from the Department of Homeland Security questioned her. From there, Trebach was moved to a federal detention facility in downtown Los Angeles, where she was held until later the next day.

When reached for comment, Tricia McLaughlin, the D.H.S. Assistant Secretary for public affairs, alleged that Trebach jumped in front of a Border Patrol vehicle leaving the federal complex, causing the driver to swerve, then “hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents.” McLaughlin further alleged that Trebach blocked agents of Customs and Border Protection from carrying out their duties, and that led to her arrest. (Trebach has not been charged with a crime.)

“None of that happened,” Trebach told me, when reached by phone. D.H.S. is “very frustrated and angry that we’re out there filming them, but we’re standing on public property.” She also said that her cellphone was confiscated while in detention, and it remains in the possession of D.H.S. As a result, Trebach, an I.C.U. nurse, worries about the additional personal information that agents may have accessed and could use to continue targeting her. “I’m scared every night when I come home that they’re going to take me away,” she said.

For Suzuki Daniels, the Peace Patrol co-founder, video of Trebach’s arrest is still challenging to watch. “I have a physical reaction to it,” she said. “The only reason that it’s not getting national outcry is that, right now, we’re being inundated with so many crimes in our communities and across the United States. I think we’re kind of stunned, and in a freeze-trauma response.”

Roughly two hours after Trebach was taken away, a group of masked agents returned to her unlocked car, rummaged through her belongings, “and held three of our Patrollers at gunpoint,” Maldonado, who was present that morning, recalled. In the Peace Patrol’s video of the confrontation, a Port Police cruiser is visible passing by, twice. Maldonado still doesn’t understand why they didn’t stop and intervene: “The federal agents never identified themselves. They’re masked. You don’t know if they’re vigilantes. You don’t know who they are. Port Police just cruised by and pretended they didn’t see it at all.”

I reached out to Thomas Gazsi, the chief of the Los Angeles Port Police, about the incident, and about the role of his department in upholding the rights of the Peace Patrollers to assemble on a public road. Gazsi confirmed that someone from his department was present the morning Trebach was detained, but clarified that it was a port-security civilian officer, not a police officer. Still, should the security officer have, at the very least, stopped to witness the incident with the gunmen, and called it in to the department? “She reported to her supervisors, which was reported to our department,” Gazsi responded. “By the time our police officers arrived out there, everybody was gone.”

The incident highlights the hollowness of the anti-Trump rhetoric of local politicians in Los Angeles. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, has repeatedly decried the federal government’s incursion into the city (calling it an “assault” and “un-American”), and saying ICE’s relentless immigration raids are a “reign of terror” that must end. In July, she issued an executive directive that bolstered a 2017 city ordinance prohibiting city resources, including the L.A.P.D., from being used in immigration-enforcement activities, “unless required by federal or state law.” Yet, in multiple videos supplied to me by Unión del Barrio, the L.A.P.D. is present at immigration-enforcement activities, not impeding the federal agents but in what appears to be an accessory role.

In a video from June 24th, immigration agents are seen actively detaining individuals on the street, while L.A.P.D. officers stand in front of them, hands perched over their gun holsters or wielding batons, as they push back a crowd that has formed to intervene. In another video, from August 13th, an L.A.P.D. officer stands a few yards from an active Homeland Security Investigations operation as a person off camera asks “why L.A.P.D. is working with Homeland Security.” The officer responds that L.A.P.D. “provides security” for the agency, and that the department has worked with H.S.I. on “many occasions.”

This difference between what politicians promise and what actually happens has become more pronounced, of late, for anyone aligned with the Democratic Party. For Suzuki Daniels, the failure of Democrats to stand up against rising right-wing authoritarianism has left her feeling jaded about the entire political system. “No politician is going to save us,” she said. After years of canvassing for political candidates, signing petitions, and making phone calls for campaigns, “everything I do for the next four years is going to be direct action and mutual aid,” she said. “I am not pleading with politicians to save me or save the people I care about. There are masked men riding around my town trying to kidnap people.”

This ethos harks back to another era of resistance in the Los Angeles harbor. Back on Terminal Island, a little after 7 A.M., Gina, another member of the group, who declined to give her last name, asked if she could show me the statue in the middle of the Japanese fishing-village memorial. She told me that her grandfather had been a Sicilian immigrant who fished in San Pedro Bay, and that he had learned how to catch tuna with longline poles—a technique introduced by Japanese immigrants, many of whom had lived on Terminal Island. During the Second World War, as the U.S. government razed Furusato, “there was a lot of protection” from the non-Japanese community, Gina, said. “There was a lot of backlash, because what [the government] did was such a dirty thing.” She choked up as she continued, “This is white supremacy, once again, trying to take a foothold—it’s full fascism. Just like what happened to the Japanese Americans.” She turned to show me the statue of two Japanese fishermen, one looking out at Los Angeles, the other staring back at the federal complex, “watching them come and go,” as if they were part of their own peace patrol. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d2e1a1d84c9f738cea23e0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Tomas_ICE_bleed.png",N,,2025-10-07 16:58:53.739609

The plaintiffs are urging the court to protect the First Amendment rights of protesters to peacefully demonstrate around the facility and of journalists to “observe, record, and report on the federal agents’ activities and the public’s demonstrations against them.”

The suit — which was filed by the newsroom Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club, local labor unions representing Chicago-area journalists and a group of individual journalist and protesters — lists specific incidents in which they say agents targeted the press, including instances where they allege six journalists were hit with either pepper balls or tear gas despite wearing visible press credentials.

They also list eight examples of protesters and residents who they said were harmed or injured by ICE officers’ “violent presence” — including a minister for a local Presbyterian Church who allegedly was struck by the pepper balls and sprayed with tear gas while trying to offer prayers to the crowd.

Videos show agents firing pepper balls and tear gas at crowds as demonstrators attempted to block ICE vehicles from the facility. A reporter for CBS News Chicago said a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball at her car, burning her face.

“The federal officers’ brutality is not a response to the violation of any previously given order to disperse or to desist,” the lawsuit states. “Rather, the brutality described in the prior paragraphs is deployed solely to silence dissent, to intimidate, and to instill fear.”

Trump plans to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Chicago this week to quell the clashes outside ICE centers and crack down on crime in the city.

Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas.","CHICAGO (AP) — Illinois leaders went to court Monday to stop President Donald Trump from sending National Guard troops to Chicago, escalating a clash between Democratic-led states and the Republican administration during an aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the nation’s third-largest city.

The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.

The lawsuit in Chicago also raised the stakes after a violent weekend: Authorities said a woman was shot by a federal agent when Border Patrol vehicles were boxed in and struck by other vehicles. The city’s police superintendent rejected suggestions that his officers were on the government’s side in volatile situations like that one.

The Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its crackdown on illegal immigration. Officials in Illinois and Oregon say military intervention isn’t needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.

The lawsuit alleges that “these advances in President Trump’s long-declared ‘War’ on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said a court hearing was scheduled for Thursday.

“Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said.

Governor: Federal wave is an ‘invasion’

Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to Chicago, along with 400 others from Texas.

Pritzker said the potential deployment amounted to “Trump’s invasion,” and he called on Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to block it. Abbott pushed back and said the crackdown was needed to protect federal workers who are in the city as part of the president’s increased immigration enforcement.

Abbott posted a picture on the social platform X on Monday night of Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, but didn’t specify where they were going.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed in a weekend statement that Trump authorized using Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Monday that he signed an executive order barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations.

Mayor limits protest hours at ICE site

Protesters have frequently rallied near an immigration facility outside the city, and federal officials reported the arrests of 13 protesters Friday near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Mayor Katrina Thompson, citing safety and other factors, said she was limiting protests to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The ACLU of Illinois on Monday sued Trump, Department of Homeland Security, ICE, Border Patrol and national and local leaders at several agencies, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside that facility. The lawsuit alleges that federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights.

DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that “the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting.”

Elsewhere, DHS acknowledged that agents shot a woman Saturday on Chicago’s southwest side. The department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said it’s reasonable for agents to use force if they believe they’re being ambushed. He noted officers were redeployed from other parts of the city to assist the agents and that 27 were affected by tear gas.

“We cannot become a society where we just decide to take everything in our own hands and start to commit crimes against law enforcement,” Snelling said.

He said it’s difficult to “toe the line” between not helping federal immigration agents and maintaining public safety.

Portland says no crime crisis there

In Portland, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order sought by Oregon and California barring the deployment of Guard troops to Oregon from any state and the District of Columbia.

Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, seemed incredulous that the president moved to send National Guard troops to Oregon from neighboring California and then from Texas on Sunday, just hours after she had ruled against it the first time.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she said. “Why is this appropriate?”

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt criticized the decision and said the president was using his authority as commander in chief.

Portland’s ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when Portland police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

In recent weeks, the nightly protests typically drew a couple dozen people — until Trump ordered the National Guard. Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility and federal agents fired tear gas. Portland police made multiple arrests.

Since June, federal agents have charged 30 people with federal crimes related to the protests at the ICE building, including assaulting federal officers, failure to comply and depredation of government property, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon said Monday.

Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years, including in Portland, where homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared to the same period in 2024, data shows.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.

Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general.
Like Mr. Sauer, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia.
Mr. Mooppan was a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration.
The pace has been frantic — Mr. Sauer has made more than two dozen requests for emergency relief — and it appears unlikely to slow anytime soon.
The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.","The prime players in Tuesday’s argument are lawyers for the State of Colorado and the Christian therapist suing over its conversion therapy law. But D. John Sauer, the solicitor general for the Trump administration, also requested that his office be allowed to participate in the arguments in support of the therapist, Kaley Chiles.

Mr. Sauer’s office has been on winning streak in front of the Supreme Court. He first broke onto the national scene with what seemed like an audacious argument: A former president could be immune from criminal prosecution even if he ordered a team of Navy SEALs to kill a political rival.

When asked by a federal appeals court, he accepted that premise that former presidents could not be criminally prosecuted for actions they took in office. He won that case before the Supreme Court in July 2024, with a majority of the justices granting Donald J. Trump substantial immunity from prosecution before he was re-elected president.

Now, Mr. Sauer, a former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk from Missouri, is the solicitor general of the United States, the voice of the Trump administration before the justices.

In his role, Mr. Sauer leads a group of lawyers within the Justice Department who decide which cases to bring before the justices on behalf of the Trump administration, shape the administration’s legal arguments and argue the cases before the court.

Tuesday’s case is being argued by Hashim M. Mooppan, a principal deputy solicitor general. Like Mr. Sauer, he was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. Mooppan was a counselor to the solicitor general during the first Trump administration.

Mr. Sauer’s path to the second Trump administration ran through Missouri, where he served as solicitor general from 2017 to 2023 before working at a private firm. He gained a reputation as a particularly assertive litigator for conservative causes, including the opposition of same-sex marriage, access to contraception and the participation of transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports.

Since his confirmation, Mr. Sauer has been at the center of a whirlwind of litigation before the justices, defending Trump administration policies on several central pieces of the president’s agenda, including imposing tariffs, ending birthright citizenship and dismantling federal agencies. The pace has been frantic — Mr. Sauer has made more than two dozen requests for emergency relief — and it appears unlikely to slow anytime soon.

So far, his office has an extraordinary track record of victories, including a 6-to-3 ruling in late June that sharply curtailed the power of federal trial court judges to issue nationwide freezes on administration policies — the main tool that opponents had used to block the president’s agenda.

Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January and began issuing a blitz of presidential orders, Mr. Sauer has largely been arguing for emergency intervention by the Supreme Court, asking that the justices overturn temporary procedural rulings from lower court judges as opposed to weighing in on the substance of the policies.

This term, the solicitor general will marshal arguments directly on the merits of some of the president’s central policies, including whether a president can impose sweeping global tariffs — a case that has been fast-tracked by the court and is scheduled to be heard in November. The court has said that it will also consider whether Mr. Trump can fire heads of independent agencies.

In late September, Mr. Sauer also asked the justices to decide whether Mr. Trump has the authority to end birthright citizenship, the foundational principle stipulating that children born on U.S. soil are Americans.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/07/multimedia/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm/07scotus-conversion-therapy-sauer-fhbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:59:10.859967

Here's what Americans say in new poll - Miami Herald,Brendan Rascius,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article312414392.html,"In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.
Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.
“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
“Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.” Is ICE targeting criminals?
ICE tactics Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.","On the 2024 campaign trail, President Donald Trump vowed to launch what he called the “largest deportation program in American history.”

Now — nearly one year after his election — many Americans are uneasy with how this pledge is being pursued, expressing concerns about the scale and intensity of Trump’s immigration crackdown, according to a new YouGov poll.

In the survey, most respondents said they believe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have wrongly arrested U.S. citizens and half describe their tactics as too forceful.

It comes as ICE arrests have dramatically increased in recent months and as a record-breaking number of people have been placed in detention centers, according to an analysis from NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in September that 400,000 non-citizens have been deported since January, with 1.6 million more having self-deported, putting the administration on pace to “shatter historic records.”

Many Republicans have applauded the immigration crackdown, crediting Trump with following through with his campaign promises. House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X, “House Republicans are united behind our brave ICE officers and all those on the frontlines of the largest deportation effort in history.”

Meanwhile, numerous Democrats have attacked recent enforcement measures, with Rep. Rashida Tlaib accusing ICE of “ripping people out of the arms of their family members, terrorizing our communities, and turning our country into a fascist police state.”

ICE arresting US citizens

In the poll — which sampled 2,295 U.S. adults on Oct. 6 — respondents were asked: “How often do you think ICE wrongly arrests U.S. citizens?”

A majority, 60%, said immigration agents arrest American citizens often (35%) or sometimes (25%). Half that share said they detain citizens rarely (24%) or never (6%). An additional 11% said they were not sure.

This question resulted in a significant partisan divide. Most Democrats and independents — 89% and 62%, respectively — said ICE agents arrest U.S. citizens often or sometimes, while 57% of Republicans said this happens rarely or not at all.

Since January, at least 15 American citizens have been apprehended by ICE, with some being swept away by masked agents and detained for hours, according to a September analysis by the New York Times. This figure represents a small fraction of overall detentions, though the exact number is difficult to determine since the government does not release data on such encounters.

DHS described this report as false and misleading.

“We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any U.S. citizens arrested are because of obstructing or assaulting law enforcement.”

Is ICE targeting criminals?

The YouGov poll — which has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points — also asked respondents: “Do you think most immigrants being arrested by ICE are people who have committed crimes beyond entering or staying in the country illegally?”

A plurality, 48%, said that they believed most of those arrested have not committed other crimes, while 29% said they have. Twenty-three percent said they were not sure.

Here, again, there were massive differences across the political spectrum.

Most Democrats and independents — 76% and 51%, respectively — said the majority of those apprehended haven’t committed crimes aside from entering the U.S. illegally. Fifty-six percent of Republicans said they had violated the law in other ways.

Trump has vowed to deport “the worst of the worst,” with a focus on “dangerous criminals,” including murderers and rapists. But, government detention data paints a different picture.

As of late June, about 58,000 people were in ICE detention facilities, according to the Associated Press. Of these individuals, 71.7% had not been convicted of a crime. About one-quarter of them had pending charges.

ICE tactics

Lastly, respondents were asked to describe the tactics being used by ICE agents.

Fifty percent said their methods are “too forceful,” while 25% said they are “about right” and 15% said they are “not forceful enough.” An additional 11% said they weren’t sure.

Most Democrats and independents — 84% and 52%, respectively — characterized ICE tactics as excessive. Meanwhile, a plurality of Republicans, 44%, said they are appropriate.

Across the country, ICE raids have sparked multiple reports of agents resorting to excessive force against detainees and bystanders, resulting in some lawsuits.

In September, an ICE officer was captured on video shoving a mother onto the floor of a courthouse in New York, according to CNN. She was hospitalized and the officer was “relieved of his current duties.”

In California, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen claimed he was tackled to the ground by ICE agents, resulting in broken bones and signs of brain injury, according to the Associated Press. He filed a $50 million lawsuit against the government.

In response, a DHS spokesperson accused him of impeding an ICE operation.

“If you lay a hand on our law enforcement, we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Sept. 19.

Each day, we’re seeing neighbors kidnapped from our streets, detained in unsafe and inhumane conditions, and deported without due process to countries they’ve never known.

If there’s one silver lining, it’s this: The more Americans see of this agenda, the less they like it. And the more immigrants tell their stories, the better people understand why they belong.

Over 15 percent of Americans are immigrants. If you live here, there’s a good chance you know one. Since the late 1800s, we’ve called on immigrants to work in industry, health care, hospitality, agriculture, and other essential jobs. Immigration is a core to our story about who we are.

Immigrants contribute greatly to our culture and economy. They work jobs, pay taxes, volunteer in churches and schools, support American sports teams, and eat American foods. In 2022, immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes — more than many big name corporations.

At the root of why immigrants come to this country is the promise of a better life — a better job, a better education for their children, a chance to reunite with family. It’s not an easy choice to pick up and leave, and the journey is often perilous. But it’s often the only choice for migrants facing violence, death threats, climate disasters, or extreme poverty.

Against all odds, on average a few million have made their way here each year for the past five years. And generally speaking, the American people want them here — over 60 percent of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s cruel treatment of immigrants.

It turns out that deporting people to unsafe “third countries” they’ve never been to, building concentration camps like Alligator Alcatraz, attempting to end birthright citizenship, and deputizing local and state police as immigration enforcement are all unpopular.

Immigrants without a criminal conviction now make up the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE. Yet the GOP’s Big Ugly Bill provided $170 billion to enact Trump’s unpopular mass deportation agenda.

Immigrant advocates like Jeanette Vizguerra are fighting back. The cost can be great — but the American people are listening.

Jeanette is a mother of four, an undocumented worker, and long-time immigrant rights activist currently in ICE detention despite having no criminal record. She founded the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition and, in 2017, was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, ICE agents detained Jeanette outside the Target store where she worked. She’s fighting her case in court, arguing that the Trump administration targeted her for her activism. Hundreds of union members, friends, and supporters have rallied outside the Aurora, Colorado detention center where she’s being held.

Also crucial to the movement are groups fighting immigration enforcement and detention. The Detention Watch Network works with local members across the nation to shut down detention facilities and block ICE expansion, urges lawmakers to cut enforcement and detention funding, and educates the public about the impact of immigration policy on ordinary people.

Both Jeanette and Detention Watch Network strive to shift from an immigration approach that emphasizes punishment to one built on dignity and freedom. Together, they’ve been awarded the 49th Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award by the Institute for Policy Studies, my organization, for their ongoing bravery and commitment to protecting our neighbors and loved ones.

The immigrant rights movement continues to fight for the human right to move and stay — and for dignified lives for all. And even with little support among mainstream politicians or the media, they’re making a huge impact in this dangerous time: Nearly 80 percent of Americans now say immigration is good for this country — a record high.

It’s time for our lawmakers and politicians to listen to their constituents. Immigration should remain a vital part of the U.S. past, present, and future.",https://otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2640297729.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:33.593630

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation.
In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule.
After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.
A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants.","The Trump administration plans to publish a new H-1B rule expected to propose additional immigration restrictions on how employers use the visa and who qualifies for it. Shortly before the White House announced a $100,000 fee on many H-1B visa holders, the Department of Homeland Security published its regulatory agenda. The agenda includes a rule to change the H-1B visa category.

The summary for the upcoming rule “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program” states: “DHS will propose to reform the H-1B program by revising eligibility for cap exemptions, providing greater scrutiny for employers that have violated program requirements, and increasing oversight over third party placements, among other provisions. These changes are intended to improve the integrity of the H-1B nonimmigrant program and better protect U.S. workers’ wages and working conditions.” The regulatory notice lists December 2025 as a possible publication date for the rule.

H-1B temporary visas are important since they typically are the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work in the United States long term and eventually gain permanent residence (a green card). The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with a 20,000 exemption for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. At U.S. universities, international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. Under U.S. law, in addition to government fees often exceeding $6,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. Research indicates that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher salaries than U.S. workers with comparable levels of education and experience.

During Donald Trump’s first term, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services implemented policies that resulted in historically high H-1B denial rates, until lawsuits and a subsequent legal settlement led to the agency’s reversal of these practices. However, the Trump administration failed to publish a final rule to change the H-1B visa category. The rule was published late in the president’s term, on October 8, 2020, and a judge blocked the H-1B rule on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. By starting the process early in Trump’s second term, administration officials seeking to impose new H-1B restrictions hope to avoid the fate of their 2020 rule.

A Second Chance On The 2020 Immigration Rule

The Trump administration’s new H-1B rule will likely incorporate elements of its unsuccessful 2020 regulation. The rule published in October 2020 had two main goals: 1) To make it more challenging for high-skilled foreign nationals to qualify for H-1B status, and 2) to prevent H-1B visa holders from working at customer sites.

In December 2024, the Biden administration published a final H-1B rule that addressed some of the issues in the Trump administration’s rule. However, Biden officials decided on those issues in ways the business community viewed more favorably.

In the first version of its rule, which was a proposed rule, the Biden administration used the phrase “directly related specific specialty,” stating a position must require “A U.S. baccalaureate or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty or its equivalent” to enter the occupation. That phrase also appeared in the Trump administration’s October 2020 rule and would have narrowed the positions considered specialty occupations.

After attorneys and companies warned that the wording would prevent many foreign-born professionals from working in America, the Biden administration modified that section in its final rule. Although DHS retained the ‘directly related’ requirement in the definition of ‘specialty occupation,’ it added language clarifying that “directly related means there is a logical connection between the degree or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.” DHS added, “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”

Kevin Miner of Fragomen noted at the time that the original language could have prevented adjudicators from allowing the H-1B category to account for emerging technologies and degree fields. “The final rule solves this concern by noting that ‘directly related’ just means that there is a ‘logical connection’ between the education and the H-1B role, which should help the H-1B category continue to evolve with technology and new kinds of jobs as they develop,” said Miner in an interview.

The Trump administration could revise this language to make it more restrictive. However, the Supreme Court decision to end Chevron deference (to federal agencies) may limit its ability to go beyond what the statute permits on this and other measures. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Loper Bright Enterprises et al. v. Raimondo: “The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled.”

The Trump administration could revisit areas that employers supported in the Biden H-1B final rule. For example, employers and university groups favored the extension of “cap-gap” protection for international students to prevent disruptions to students’ status and work authorization. Employers and university groups also supported provisions in the final rule that allow more organizations to qualify as H-1B cap-exempt nonprofit research institutions and greater leeway for H-1B visa holders to become entrepreneurs.

The Biden final rule also eliminated the application of the “itinerary requirement” to H-1B visa holders working at different locations. Employers argued that requiring a detailed itinerary of where and how long an H-1B professional works conflicted with modern work practices.

Trump’s 2020 Immigration Rule Restricted H-1B Visa Holders Working At Customer Locations

For much of Donald Trump’s first term, Trump officials sought to make it infeasible for an employer to send an H-1B visa holder to work at a customer’s location. A 2018 “Contracts and Itineraries” memo imposed new H-1B restrictions. When companies wanted to send H-1B employees to work on customer sites, USCIS often limited the approval period, sometimes to a single day. (The October 2020 rule would have limited H-1B visa holders working on customer sites to approvals lasting only one year.) Court losses and a legal settlement led to the agency ending the practices.

In rulemaking, Trump officials attempted again to make working in H-1B status at a customer’s location far more challenging. They adopted a controversial definition of what qualified as an employer-employee relationship, changing the long-held Department of Labor meaning. After a judge blocked the October 2020 interim final H-1B rule, the Trump administration posted online (but did not publish) a “final rule” in mid-January, together with a Department of Labor memo.

Although the measures did not take effect, attorneys argue that they represented a radical interpretation of labor and immigration law. Trump officials believed they could prevent companies from employing H-1B professionals who fulfill contracts at customer locations by shifting the legal obligations onto customers. In January 2021, via the unpublished final H-1B rule and DOL memo, the Trump administration sought to require not only information technology and professional services companies to submit H-1B petitions and labor condition applications but also their customers. That would have made the customers, in effect, employers of the H-1B visa holders rather than the recipients of services.

To give a mundane example, picture a landscaping company telling a homeowner they need to assume immigration obligations for the company’s employees who mow the homeowner’s lawn or trim the bushes. Few, if any, customers will assume immigration or other legal obligations for individuals they cannot hire or fire.

The Trump administration’s rule blocking IT and other services at customer sites would have affected not only suppliers but also the companies that receive services. A similar provision in a future rule could also affect productivity. University of California-Davis’ Giovanni Peri and Kevin Shih and Colgate University’s Chad Sparber concluded that the presence of foreign STEM workers accounts for approximately 30% to 50% of the aggregate productivity growth in the United States between 1990 and 2010. A percentage point increase in the share of foreign STEM workers in a city's employment mix “increased the wage growth of native college-educated labor by about 7 to 8 percentage points,” according to the research.

According to industry experts, IT services provided today, particularly those delivered by more established companies, are specialized and often involve substantial contracts worth several hundred million dollars or even $1 billion. The contracts typically provide skills, services or knowledge that U.S. companies do not possess in-house, or that may not make practical or financial sense to staff in-house, particularly for project-oriented work. Examples include incorporating AI throughout a healthcare provider’s network, providing technical support for a clothing company’s hardware and software across multiple platforms and initiating digital solutions to improve the operations of a pharmaceutical company.

Analysts note that by entering into expensive contracts to receive these services, companies demonstrate that they view these expenditures as necessary to compete, which means they improve the productivity of U.S. companies. H-1B visa holders are not the only professionals to service these contracts, but industry experts consider these types of technical services essential, given how the U.S. and global economy function today. (In FY 2025, there were entries for 442,000 unique beneficiaries in the H-1B registration process, according to DHS, which indicates that if no major companies that provide information technology services had received approved new H-1B petitions in FY 2025 as in previous years, the agency still would not have selected more than 300,000 H-1B beneficiaries due to the 85,000 annual limit. That indicates the most significant problem in the H-1B category for employers seeking high-skilled foreign nationals is the low yearly limit relative to the demand in a technology-driven economy.)

A New Immigration Rule To Restrict Employment-Based Green Cards

DHS will also propose a rule that could affect employment-based immigrants. According to the abstract, the proposed rule will, among other things, “update provisions governing extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; modernize outdated provisions for individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers; clarify evidentiary requirements for first preference classifications, second preference national interest waiver classifications, and physicians of national and international renown.” The regulatory notice lists ​January 2026 as a possible publication date.

Attorneys believe the proposed rule may be the Trump administration’s opportunity to eliminate the Biden administration’s efforts to clarify and expand eligibility for O-1A visas and national interest waivers.

On January 21, 2022, the Biden administration announced new guidance that encouraged more employers and high-skilled foreign nationals to use the O-1A visa category and national interest waivers.

“O-1A [are for] individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry),” according to USCIS. Receiving a national interest waiver allows individuals and employers to avoid the costly and time-consuming PERM process when filing for an immigrant visa in the employment-based second preference category.

After the new guidance, O-1A applications rose from 7,710 in FY 2021 to 10,010 in FY 2023, and the approval rate remained above 90%. There is no annual limit on O-1A visas.

Receipts for national interest waiver requests increased by 51% from FY 2021 to FY 2022 (14,610 to 21,990), according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. For FY 2022 to FY 2023, receipts for national interest waiver requests rose by 81%, from 21,990 to 39,810, although the approval rate declined.

Efren Hernandez, until recently a supervisory policy analyst at USCIS and now the founder of EH3 Immigration Consulting, believes DHS may make it harder for individuals to qualify under the employment-based first preference, also known as EB-1. He pointed out in an interview that to demonstrate “extraordinary ability” under the EB-1 category, a green card applicant must “provide evidence of a one-time achievement (i.e., Pulitzer, Oscar, Olympic Medal)” or to meet at least 3 of 10 criteria, such as “evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media.” DHS could raise that bar, for example, by requiring an applicant to meet 5 of 10 criteria or not allowing reasonable alternatives in fields that don’t have annual awards or that match the examples USCIS cites.

In recent research, economists Exequiel Hernandez (UPENN Wharton School), Britta Glennon (UPENN and NBER) and Jens Friedmann (Erasmus University Rotterdam School of Management) concluded that the more restrictions a company encounters on hiring foreign-born talent, the more acquisitions it will subsequently make. “In terms of immigration policy, our findings challenge the narrative that constraining immigration creates more opportunities for native workers,” according to the authors. “An acquisition is a very strong, costly commitment—both in terms of the purchase price and in the organizational adjustments required to make such a transaction work. It is unlikely that firms would be responding to immigration restrictions through acquisitions unless the need for the foregone talent were real.”

Exequiel Hernandez said in an interview that the research shows policymakers harm U.S. competitiveness when they restrict high-skilled immigration. “I think the paper is one more drop in the ocean of evidence that high-skilled immigration policy in the U.S. cannot be based on the assumption that there’s a readily available pool of U.S.-born workers firms would hire if we restrict visas for foreign-born workers.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/687dbd442ceeab75a457a29e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-07 17:58:00.892479

As of October 6, 2025, federal courts remain open and are drawing on non-appropriated funds to continue operations. But the federal judiciary has warned that if it exhausts those funds, it may have to reduce operations to essential functions.

The Administrative Office of the US Courts released a statement indicating that existing funds will last until at least October 17. After that, should the shutdown remain in effect, impacts on the judicial system may grow and will likely vary by jurisdiction.

In prior shutdowns, disruptions were kept to a minimum, but that is because most shutdowns did not last significant amounts of time. During the 2018–19 shutdown (the longest in history, at 34 days), courts ultimately shifted to essential-only staffing, which caused additional delays at the district court level.

If this shutdown persists beyond mid-October and courts furlough non-essential staff, civil cases could similarly face broad delays as resources tighten.

For now, most litigants should expect business as usual in the nation’s courthouses, at least in private civil matters. The judiciary has not broadly paused proceedings or deadlines, and the electronic filing system is still operational.

However, parties in civil cases involving the federal government may see efforts from government lawyers to pause proceedings. Government counsel, representing federal agencies and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in civil cases, have been told to seek delays in most matters. It is within a court’s discretion to pause or delay proceedings, and we anticipate that a substantial percentage of such requests will be granted. If a court denies a request for a delay, federal parties will likely comply with that ruling, subject to staffing restraints from the shutdown. The federal government has indicated that it will not seek to delay criminal prosecutions or extraditions.

How courts react to the federal shutdown will vary on a district-by-district, and even judge-by-judge, basis. In the US District Court for the District of Columbia, for example, Chief Judge James Boasberg unilaterally extended all deadlines in civil cases involving government lawyers for the duration of the shutdown given the high volume of cases involving government attorneys.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15361_4613.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:59.835582

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strongarm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, now in the seventh day of a federal shutdown.
While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are most always reimbursed once government reopens.
Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.
The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers, but not the actual appropriation.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

Trump signed legislation into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strongarm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, now in the seventh day of a federal shutdown.

“That should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson at a press conference at the Capitol.

Johnson, a lawyer, said he hadn’t fully read the memo but “there are some legal analysts who are saying” that it may not be necessary or appropriate to repay the federal workers.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington blasted the Trump administration as defying the law.

“Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards,"" said Murray, who is the ranking lawmaker on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be — federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”

Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices, and almost certainly would be met with legal action.

While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are most always reimbursed once government reopens.

In a single-page memo from Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russ Vought, first reported by Axios, the office's general counsel seeks to lay out a legal rationale for no backpay of federal workers.

The memo explains that while the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 says workers shall be paid after federal funding is restored, it argues the action is not self-executing. Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.

The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers, but not the actual appropriation.

Congress, it says, is able to decide whether it wants to pay the workers or not.

For now, Congress remains at a standstill, with neither side — nor the White House — appearing willing to budge. Democrats are fighting for health care funds to prevent a lapse in federal subsidies that threaten to send insurance rates skyrocketing. Republicans say the issue can be dealt with later.

A prominent face on the daily Palestinian solidarity demonstrations outside the Bourse, a major city square, Farajalah was arrested three months ago after one such protest and placed in immigration detention, according to activists.

Farajalah’s mother had recently died in Gaza, but he had been denied permission to leave the detention facility to mourn her, according four sources with knowledge of the situation, including Anas Hamam, a Moroccan detainee who had met Farajalah in the “127 Bis” detention center but was transferred to another facility a month ago.

How Farajalah’s mother passed remains unclear.

Hamam told The Intercept by phone, “He was such an incredible person, the kindest and the most thoughtful person who I ever met in that center.”

Around eight Palestinians are thought to have been held in Belgium’s detention camps, according to activists. Many were arrested by plainclothes police officers after Bourse demonstrations.

Last week, Amnesty International called for an investigation into Belgium’s harsh crackdowns on the protesters. Riot police had used tear gas and water cannons on demonstrators in Brussels against Israel’s interdiction of an aid flotilla to Gaza last week.

Belgium’s migration and asylum service confirmed Farajalah’s death, but spokesperson Dominique Ernould declined any further comment citing confidentiality and the privacy of the family.

“The situation is calm in the center,” Ernould said. “The necessary support is being provided to the center’s residents and staff members.”

Asylum Denied

Two sources, including Hamam and a pro-Palestine activist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said that Farajalah had recently had an asylum claim turned down.

“He didn’t have papers,” the activist said. “Belgium denied him access to international protection.”

As word of Farajalah’s death spread, Palestine solidarity organizers called for a protest of “fire, rage, noise” outside the detention center on Saturday.

“He had lost his mother,” organizers wrote on an Instagram post. “He had asked to be released so he could mourn. He had written. He had pleaded. The administration ignored him. The system crushed him. Silence killed him.”

A group calling itself “Getting the Voice Out” sent The Intercept a statement saying that other detainees in the facility were outraged by the death.

“They are starting a hunger strike at the center and have made a flag with his name on it,” the statement said. “They tell us, ‘Today it’s Mahmoud, tomorrow it’s someone else. Security is laughing at us. We have to do something.’”

Activists and a former detainee at “127 Bis” said people held there were routinely denied phone calls and internet access, among other charges.

Ernould, the migration authority spokesperson, denied claims by activists and Palestinian detainees — one of whom has talked to The Intercept — of mistreatment in the detention camps.

U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is expected to visit the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland on Tuesday. Noem's visit is the latest event in the Trump administration's ongoing push to send National Guard troops into Portland.

Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden strongly condemned Noem's visit.

""Kristi Noem is cosplaying as a public official,"" Wyden said in a statement to KGW. ""In reality, she's been sent by Trump to incite violence. Don't tar and feather her as Speaker Johnson suggested for Governor Newsom. The best response to her playacting as cop? Ignore her and keep supporting the members of our community.""

In a joint statement, the city of Portland and the Portland Police Bureau said they had been notified of Noem's visit, but had not received full details of her agenda.

""In the interest of public safety, Portland Police will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary,"" the city and PPB said in a statement. ""This protects our community, by making sure our roads and public spaces stay safe.""

In a social media post, PPB warned that roads may be impacted ""around the Portland area,"" with possible temporary closures in the South Waterfront. On Tuesday morning, officers blocked off a one-block radius around the ICE facility in South Waterfront to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and could be heard on a loudspeaker warning people to back up.

The city and police statement reiterated that under Portland's sanctuary city status, local police will not assist with federal immigration enforcement activities.

""We urge Portlanders to continue to remain safe,"" the city and PPB said. ""Recent court decisions have affirmed that Portland does not need federal military intervention, and that our local public-safety approach stands on firm legal ground.""

The administration has argued that the troops are needed to help protect the ICE office in Portland's South Waterfront neighborhood, where for several months a small group of demonstrators has gathered outside, leading to occasional clashes with federal agents guarding the building. This week, President Donald Trump described the city as a ""burning hellhole."" Local officials have said the administration is grossly exaggerating the scale of the incidents.

Since nightly protests began in June, Portland police have made 37 arrests. The Portland FBI office said it has made 149 arrests, though many have not led to charges.

But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that ""if people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate"".

She also defended remarks made by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick who said Handsworth in Birmingham was ""one of the worst-integrated places"" he had ever been to.

He went on: ""I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated.

""It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives.""

Asked about the comments, he told the BBC's Chris Mason: ""There are numerous parts of our country now where the same story is happening, and at the extreme levels, a lack of integration leads us into a very dark place as a country.

""We're here in Manchester today, a week on from a terrible terrorist attack where a man who lived in our country for 30 years clearly wasn't well integrated, clearly didn't share British values because he went on to murder British Jews.""

His earlier comments have provoked criticism from opposition politicians.

Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham.

""Rubbish piled up in the streets and what were the politicians focusing on - airports in Pakistan and Gaza,"" she said.

""We need people to have their eyes focused on what is going on in this country.""

Badenoch told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that immigration was something her party ""got wrong"" in government and that was why she was coming up with ""tougher"" policies including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to deport 750,000 illegal immigrants in five years.

As the litigation has played out in court, the White House has started handpicking members of the press pool, breaking with decades of precedent where members of the pool that track the president’s daily activities are chosen by the White House Correspondents’ Association.","The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the White House Correspondents’ Association, joined by 46 news and media organizations, are urging a federal appeals court to restore the Associated Press’s access to the White House press pool, arguing that the government’s expulsion of the news service in retaliation for its editorial decision violated the First Amendment.

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed on Monday, the media coalition highlights the threat posed by the White House’s decision earlier this year to exclude the AP from covering certain White House events after the news service chose not to follow President Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. The brief asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to affirm a lower-court ruling in favor of the AP, emphasizing the White House press pool’s historic function as an “independent chronicler of the presidency” that is essential to the free flow of information to the public about the nation’s highest office.

The White House presumably hopes that “under threat of retaliatory ejection, questioning will be friendlier — that outlets will face pressure to pull their punches, to gloss over mistakes or unartful remarks, to avoid pressing for answers,” the brief argues. “And were it to succeed, the core function of the pool — to offer a complete, candid record of the presidency — would atrophy.”

The brief is the latest showing of broad support for the AP among news and media organizations. In February, the Reporters Committee led a media coalition of more than 30 news organizations in sending a letter to the White House, which noted that “[a]ll news organizations covering the White House are negatively affected when one peer outlet is singled out in a manner that crosses a constitutional line.”

The Reporters Committee then filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the AP after the news service sued the White House in federal district court. In April, U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden sided with the news service and ordered the White House to re-admit AP journalists into the pool.

“[U]nder the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists — be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere — it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,” Judge McFadden wrote in his 41-page order. “The Constitution requires no less.”

That order has been stayed by the D.C. Circuit while the Trump administration’s full appeal is taken up by the appeals court.

The Prime Minister has referred to people recognised by the UK government as facing a real risk of persecution in their home country as having obtained a “golden ticket”. The government has made clear that it will not restore refugee family reunion rights in its previous form and has indicated that the current path to settlement for refugees may also be under threat.

This statement followed hot on the heels of an announcement by the Home Secretary of the introduction of a new “contribution-based settlement model” for those in the immigration system. There is not much new in the announcement which was trailed in the immigration white paper a few months ago. The lack of detail has caused a huge amount of concern with those potentially affected, in particular because the government continues to provide mixed messages about whether or not any changes will apply to those already here.

Last week the inquest into the death of Leonard Farruku on the Bibby Stockholm concluded that the move to the barge was not the reason for his death. However, unsurprisingly to those with any experience of Home Office safeguarding, the coroner also identified failings including a total lack of response by the Home Office to an email from Clearsprings raising urgent concerns about Mr Farruku’s mental health.

On Free Movement, in today’s post Ross Kennedy looks at the doubling in sponsor licence revocations over the past year and sets out what immigration lawyers need to understand about enforcement in this context. Last week we updated our briefing on Hamid hearings, to include some up to date examples including the recent case of the barrister who misused AI in an immigration appeal.

There were also case write ups including a successful challenge to certification of a human rights claim of a gay Indian man, meaning he will now be able to appeal the refusal. In another case, a grandmother deported from the UK over 20 years ago, whose family live in the UK, has lost her challenge to the refusal to revoke her deportation order.

Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed.
To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed.
In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute.
Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request.","Immigration Matters is a recurring series by César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández that analyzes the court’s immigration docket, highlighting emerging legal questions about new policy and enforcement practices.

As the Supreme Court uses its emergency docket more frequently in disputes over high-profile policies, tension over the effect of decisions issued from that fast-paced process is brewing in public. Ten days after Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor publicly described the emergency docket’s limitations, the Justice Department took to the emergency docket in Noem v. National TPS Alliance to ask the court to treat a three-paragraph order as binding in a case over Biden-era legal protection from deportation for Venezuelans that the Trump administration is trying to end. On Friday, the court sided with the government.

Unlike cases that reach the court’s merits docket, which involve lengthy fact-finding and legal argumentation over years, emergency docket cases move relatively quickly. Often, the court issues a decision within months of the lawsuit being filed in a federal district court. Most emergency docket decisions are short pronouncements. Since they often focus on a specific procedural matter, it isn’t unusual for the justices to recycle sentences and fail to explain their reasoning.

Issuing a decision quickly is valuable, but it comes at a cost. Last month, Barrett explained the downside of the emergency docket’s truncated decision-making process. “There’s no opportunity for percolation” of legal arguments in the lower courts, she told Sarah Isgur from SCOTUSblog and David French of The New York Times in an interview on the Advisory Opinions podcast (published by The Dispatch, which owns SCOTUSblog). “We might be writing sooner than we want to be or with less information than we want to be,” Barrett added. To get a decision out quickly, the justices can’t hear multiple perspectives on the legal issues as they normally do for cases on the court’s merits docket. “You don’t have the time to go back and forth if you’re actually going to dispose of these things quickly,” Barrett explained.

Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” in early September, Sotomayor explained the importance of written opinions, which certainly applies in the context of the emergency docket. Sotomayor noted that persuasion is the court’s only weapon, and written opinions are how the court tries to persuade the public. “We don’t have the power of the purse, so we can’t threaten people with money. We don’t have an army,” she said. “We have the power of persuasion and so we write in the hopes of convincing all of you, the public, that there’s a reason for why we’re ruling the way we are.”

After the justices issue their written opinions, Barrett and Sotomayor have each suggested that the public needs to do its part to inform itself. “Read the opinion,” Barrett said in 2022. Echoing her last month, Sotomayor stated, “read the decisions.” Responding to Colbert’s questions, Sotomayor said that orders in which the justices don’t provide their reasoning don’t have the same effect as decisions in which the justices explain themselves. When the court doesn’t explain its reasoning, an emergency docket order “doesn’t control,” Sotomayor said.

Recent litigation over legal protections for citizens of Venezuela illustrates the emergency docket’s speed and the lack of explanation in its rulings. In National TPS Alliance v. Noem, a group of Venezuelans who had been granted Temporary Protected Status, along with an organization that advocates on behalf of TPS recipients, sued Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Feb. 19, claiming that she failed to follow the required procedures to terminate their legal authorization to live in the United States.

A federal district court agreed on March 31, concluding that Noem likely violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution’s equal protection clause. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused, less than a month later, to put the district court’s order on hold while the government appealed, the Justice Department turned to the emergency docket on May 1 to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Three months after the lawsuit began, on May 19, the justices granted the government’s request, pausing the district court’s order.

As is common in emergency docket decisions, the justices did not explain why they put the lower court’s order on hold. The court’s decision includes six sentences spread across three paragraphs. One of those paragraphs consists of a single sentence noting that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed with her colleagues, but it does not say why. Another paragraph consists of four sentences, three of which describe the process by which the case reached the court’s emergency docket or the process that will follow. This generic process explanation is identical to statements made in other emergency docket orders.

Only the remaining paragraph, which consists of one sentence, refers to the specific legal issue at stake in the case. Even then, the justices don’t address their reasoning. The justices noted that their order shouldn’t “prejudice” any legal challenge to Noem’s attempt to strip Venezuelans of work permits and legal authorization to continue living in the United States. Except for Jackson, we can’t even be sure whether all the justices voted with the majority.

Since the Supreme Court issued its decision in May, the legal fight over TPS has returned to the lower federal courts. In a 69-page opinion issued in September, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen noted that the Supreme Court “did not provide any specific rationale for its decision” but did permit the legal challenge over the required procedure to move forward. For that reason, Chen described in detail Noem’s decision-making process, then concluded that she failed to comply with federal law. Chen ordered Noem to postpone the decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the government’s request to pause Chen’s order, prompting the Justice Department to again request intervention by the Supreme Court.

In its ongoing legal fight to end TPS for Venezuelans, the Justice Department prompted the justices to downplay Barrett’s worry about the front end of the emergency docket process and disagree with Sotomayor’s claim about its future impact. Since the court had already blocked implementation of the lower court’s decision once, it should do so again, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the government’s most recent request to the Supreme Court in this case. Despite the short length of the court’s earlier order, “there was no need for speculation” about its reasons, Sauer claimed. The justices “evidently concluded that the government was likely to succeed,” he added. For that reason, the court’s prior order “squarely controlled” the current round of litigation, Sauer wrote. The 9th Circuit’s refusal to stay Chen’s September order was “indefensible” and a “needless afront to stare decisis,” the principle that courts should follow earlier rulings about similar legal issues, Sauer added.

Sauer’s application to stay Chen’s order invited the justices to clarify what to make of the typical emergency docket decision. Should lower courts and lawyers assume that decisions are meant to have lasting impact even if they number no more than a handful of sentences? To Barrett, emergency docket decisions are rushed. To Sotomayor, decisions in which the justices don’t explain their reasoning, as is true in National TPS Alliance, should have limited influence on future legal proceedings.

In another short decision in this case, the justices signaled that their emergency docket orders do sometimes control later stages of a dispute. The majority decision, released late Friday, numbers three paragraphs, most of which recite basic facts about the process this case has followed. In two sentences of one three-sentence paragraph, the majority announced that they see little difference in the strength of arguments made by the parties now and in May. Since “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed, the majority announced, “[t]he same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.” They did not explain why.

As is common in emergency docket cases, the majority opinion is unsigned. Justices Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the government’s request. Writing for herself, Jackson lamented the majority’s willingness to use its power to contradict “reasoned and thoughtful written opinions” by lower court judges while failing to write an opinion explaining themselves. Neither Sotomayor nor Kagan explained their reasoning.

Having agreed with the Justice Department despite the concerns that Sotomayor and Barrett raised, the court has once again put lower courts and lawyers in a position to attempt to divine meaning out of sparse text. And instead of reading thoughtful reasoning, as Barrett and Sotomayor implore, it has left ordinary people to read the judicial equivalent of tea leaves. Neither is likely to help courts, lawyers, or the public make sense of why the court does what it does.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 11:58:05.904707

Who controls the National Guard?
The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.
""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.
It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there.","President Trump is bucking tradition and legal precedent in pushing to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities such as Portland, Ore., and Chicago due to what he says is rampant crime and to support his crackdown on illegal immigration.

On Monday, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to the state — arguing that the administration has exceeded its authority under Title 10, the statute that allows the president to bring the guard into federal service.

Legal experts say Trump is testing the limits of presidential authority by using the rarely used statute to deploy federal troops to American cities without state approval. And the legal tactic is getting mixed results in federal court.

Oregon and Portland officials successfully delayed efforts to send troops there. But by Monday evening, a federal judge in Illinois declined the request to immediately block the deployment.

Portland and Chicago are just two of the latest cities where Trump has threatened to send troops. He sent hundreds of troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer and the National Guard has also been ordered to Memphis — a move supported by Tennessee's Republican governor.

Who controls the National Guard?

The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.

""State active duty"" is when troops are under state command and state funded. Title 32 — which is how the guard is being deployed in Memphis — is when troops are under state command but federally funded. Then, there's Title 10, which is when guard members are both federally controlled and funded.

According to the provision, the president can deploy the National Guard into federal service when the county is under an invasion, a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or the president is unable with the ""regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.""

In federal court, the Trump administration has claimed that it is unable to ""execute the laws of the United States"" as it relates to immigration enforcement due to protests in these cities.

""This law hasn't been used in this way before, by any previous president,"" said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.

Generally, the National Guard has been federalized and deployed domestically to respond to civil unrest in extreme circumstances, where state and local law enforcement were completely overwhelmed, Goitein said.

Critics of the troop deployments argue that the situations in Portland and Chicago do not rise to the level of a rebellion. They also say that for troops to be federalized, their governor of each state still needs to approve a Title 10 order.

Goitein said, ""It's not about whether the federal government should have this authority at all. It's about whether the federal government should be able to use these authorities based on what really appear to be completely contrived claims about the situation on the ground.""

Could Trump use the Insurrection Act?

One way that a sitting president has deployed the guard domestically without a state's consent was through the Insurrection Act — a set of laws meant to address major civil unrest. It also allows federal troops to take part in law enforcement activities like searches and arrests.

It's only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, with the last instance being over 30 years ago during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

""For better or for worse, I think the insurrection Act has been a third rail politically for much of its history,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.

In his second term, Trump has floated the idea of using the Insurrection Act. On Monday, when asked by a reporter under what circumstances he would invoke it, Trump said, ""If people were being killed and courts were holding us or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that.""

Vladeck doesn't think Trump invoking the law is out of the question. He said, ""I think that the administration understands that that would be an even more dramatic escalation.""

How are courts responding?

For the most part, federal judges in California and Oregon have expressed wariness and skepticism over the troop deployments.

In California, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, who has presided over the state's challenge to the guard deployment, strongly criticized the Trump administration over the move, calling it illegal and asserting that federal officials did not follow proper protocol for federalizing troops.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, however, has previously argued that ""a great level of deference"" had to be given to the president's assessment that a situation required military intervention.

In Oregon, after temporarily blocking the federalization of the state's National Guard members, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the facts just could not be supported that a military intervention was needed — even if deference was given.

""As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,"" she wrote Saturday in her order.

It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy guard members there. On Monday, U.S. District Judge April Perry declined to immediately block a troop deployment and gave the administration until the end of Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit filed by state and city officials.

Vladeck believes it will be up to the courts to check presidential authority on this issue.

And, he said, ""sooner or later"" the Supreme Court will have to weigh in on what circumstances support military intervention in American cities.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F85%2Fe6a5a9f0439d96e684ea464234ff%2Fgettyimages-2218877782.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:57:00.177950

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is challenging a Michigan Court of Appeals decision from last year that dismissed its case because the deadline to file had passed.

The lawsuit says the state has been improperly denying injured worker benefits to people without legal status.

“If we want work conditions that are dignified, fair and healthy, we must ensure that workers’ compensation system is administered as intended to protect all workers,” said MIRC attorney Anna Hill Galendez. “The reality is many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more.”

Part of MIRC’s case is the not-for-profit law firm must continue to expend resources filing workers' compensation lawsuits against the state.

In September, Prime Minster Salam said that “the children of Lebanon, regardless of origin or circumstance, must never be deprived of their right to learn.” Both have emphasized that education is a national priority needed to revitalize the country.

But in a disappointing move, on September 30, the government restricted access to education for many refugees. It continued last year’s mandate requiring that non-Lebanese students show valid residency permits or a valid ID issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to register for “second shift” classes in Lebanon’s public schools for the 2025-2026 school year. Generally, Palestinian refugee children, including those from Syria, attend UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools rather than public schools.

According to a spokesperson from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), last year at least 28,000 non-Lebanese children were effectively barred from public education because of the legal residency requirement.

While Lebanon initially maintained an open-door policy for Syrians seeking refuge, by 2015 the government began enacting stricter residency requirements and stringent criteria for renewal of residency permits.

Anti-ICE demonstrations in Seattle have varied in size and have included peaceful gatherings as well as more aggressive, disruptive actions.

Portland's protests have tended to be smaller and more focused on one specific ICE facility in the southern part of the city, though groups of several hundred gathered occasionally. At times, these demonstrators have used barricades, caused property damage, set small fires, and clashed with federal officers. There has been occasional violence that has led to multiple arrests.

“We see that President Trump has been ignoring all the court rulings that have been happening, all the injunctions,” Mora-Cheung said. “I think it makes sense that people are extremely angry, to the point in which they want to be able to show some level of violence. It's pent up anger for a lot of people over these years of their system failing them.""

Seattle's ICE protests have frequently been larger and dispersed through downtown, not just outside Department of Homeland Security facilities.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have arrested a slew of Chicago’s ""worst-of-the-worst"" offenders, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Monday.

The DHS statement, titled ""Despite Multiple Vehicle Attacks by Domestic Terrorists, DHS Law Enforcement Arrests Worst of Worst"" listed several suspects taken into custody.

Among them was Wilmer Alexander Gonzalez Garaban, an alleged member of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang with a criminal history of theft and resisting an officer.

Ricardo Gervasio-Gervasio was included as a repeat offender convicted of drug crimes and DUI.

Jorge Mario Ramirez-Lopez, a criminal illegal immigrant from Guatemala, was also listed and has a conviction for larceny.

Ricardo Gervasio-Gervasio, from Mexico, who has convictions for cocaine possession, driving under the influence of liquor and dangerous drugs was also referenced.

Officials cited other individuals who were apprehended for assault, fraud, illegal reentry, and aggravated assault.

Secretary Kristi Noem praised agents and officers' persistence in the statement and said their efforts were despite violent resistance.

DHS claims that Operation Midway Blitz, launched in early September, has already led to over 1,000 arrests statewide, representing a major escalation in federal enforcement.

One of the most dramatic incidents occurred on October 4 in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood, where agents were reportedly surrounded by several vehicles, one of which rammed a federal car.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/trump-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:57:52.542865

Thompson's order limits protests outside the ICE facility at 1930 Beach Street and the designated protest area at 2000 S. 25th Av. to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

According to the order, the mayor decided to set a limit on protest times ""due to the recent escalation of violence by ICE"" outside the facility, including ""needlessly deploying tear gas, pepper spray, mace, and rubber bullets at individuals and reporters, thereby injuring Village residents, Village police officers, and Village firefighters.""

The mayor said the order is needed to balance the constitutional rights of protesters with the needs of Broadview residents and businesses.

""People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,"" said Thompson. ""I have repeatedly said that I intend to defend the protesters' constitutionally protected free speech rights. I support their cause. But the repeated clashes with ICE agents in our town are causing enormous disruptions in the quality of life for my residents whose rights I have taken an oath to protect. We live here. Our residents live here and deserve dignity and respect.""

CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller predicted, if the mayor's order faces a court challenge, it would be ruled unconstitutional.

""The First Amendment doesn't say it can only be done during business hours, and I think that that order will be struck down by a judge somewhere along the line, because it's clearly unconstitutional,"" he said.

Protests outside the ICE facility have repeatedly grown heated, with ICE agents firing projectiles and using tear gas at times.

Tensions between protesters and ICE agents have escalated multiple times in recent weeks. The majority of those clashes have taken place in the streets outside the ICE vehicles have been leaving or arriving at the facility, and protesters have tried to block their path.

On Thursday, state and local officials established a designated protest zone outside the ICE facility.

Illinois and Cook County officials said they have set up a temporary unified command to coordinate public safety efforts outside the ICE facility in Broadview.

Illinois State Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office, the Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency have set up designated areas for protesters outside the facility, while leaving the street open for vehicles.

Crews installed new concrete barriers Thursday night establishing the designated protest zones and restricted area outside the ICE facility.

""The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights. The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,"" Illinois State Police said.

Thompson said that, on Saturday night, a ""very aggressive crowd of protesters"" got out of control, and shut down 25th Avenue outside the ICE facility, and tried to block the nearby Eisenhower Expressway as well.

""We had over 60 state troopers helping and we had to seek additional assistance from other local police departments who rushed to Broadview to help. And Broadview residents had to suffer through that mayhem,"" Thompson said.

Demonstrators and residents express concerns over limited protest times during village board meeting

During a village board meeting on Monday evening, protestors and residents voiced their concerns, saying the order to protest between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. infringes on First Amendment rights. The mayor fired back, saying this is needed to help people who live in Broadview feel safe and return to some sort of normalcy.

""This order, while well-intentioned, goes too far,"" Anjali said. ""It silences working residents that can only gather after 6 p.m.""

Some say that it is not free speech, but Mayor Thompson said that's not her intention.

""Let me be clear, I will always support the First Amendment and right of people to peacefully protest, but as Mayor I must also balance the right with the safety and well-being of Broadview residents and the businesses.""

At the meeting, Thompson also addressed the video showing Secretary Kristi Noem attempting to use the village hall bathroom on Friday before she was turned away.

""Let me be clear. I've never known an individual to bring a videographer and a photographer to a bathroom break,"" she said.

Thompson said there must be an urgent public health matter inside the Broadview facility. She now wants authorities to check on the people and plumbing inside.

""I am calling on all federal elected congressional officials, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, to inspect the facility immediately.""

As for the nine-hour time limit for protestors, Thompson said the village needs this as they do not have the resources to pay first responders' overtime.

She's not sure if protestors will abide by the order, but she says police will follow protocols.

""It's not in their community. When they leave Broadview, guess where they get to go back, to a safe, calm environment,"" Thompson said.

There will be a hearing in federal court on Tuesday morning, where the village is fighting to get the fence down around the ICE facility that was put up a couple of weeks ago to keep protestors back.

The detainee, Willian Alberto Giménez González, has been active at St. Paul and the Redeemer Episcopal Church on Chicago’s South Side since Fall 2023. The church is hosting a prayer vigil Oct. 7 for González – and for all “our immigrant neighbors” – as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conduct raids and detain residents across the Chicago area.

“We believe that Willian’s detention is unjust, and that his immediate release would benefit not just Willian and his family but also our community and our country,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in a written statement, which noted that González is an asylum-seeker who had recently received a work permit. “Yet ICE arrested him anyway and quickly moved him across state lines.”

González was taken into custody Sept. 12 during an ICE traffic stop. His attorney told an American Prospect reporter that González, at the time of the incident, was taking his wife to get a haircut in a largely Latino neighborhood southwest of downtown Chicago. After being held briefly at an ICE facility in suburban Chicago, he was taken to a different ICE facility in Baldwin, Michigan, north of Grand Rapids.

“ICE is circumventing laws and processes to create terror in communities of people seeking a better life, and we are joining with Christians and others who feel spiritually compelled to call for justice and mercy,” St. Paul and the Redeemer said in its statement.

ICE has taken an increasingly aggressive approach toward immigration enforcement in Chicago, the United States’ third largest city, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up arrests and deportations and fulfill a campaign promise of sharply reducing both legal and illegal immigration.

Early last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching a major immigrant enforcement action in Chicago that it dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” Since then, local officials, Democratic state legislators, immigrant advocates and residents have accused the Trump administration of heavy-handed tactics that have sometimes involved detentions of people with no criminal records or immigration violations.

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested in Chicago in the past month, including 37 on Sept. 30 in an early-morning ICE raid that targeted one apartment building on Chicago’s South Side. Residents reported fearing they were under siege by a military-style operation. Agents reportedly landed on the building from helicopters, then went door to door making arrests.

President Donald Trump has vowed to further escalate the crackdown by sending troops, including the Texas National Guard, into Chicago and other Democrat-led cities, saying reinforcements are needed to protect federal property and employees. After federal agents shot and injured a woman in Chicago on Oct. 4, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Chicago a “war zone.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of manufacturing a crisis and then making it worse. The ICE agents in Chicago were indiscriminately “picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Pritzker said in an Oct. 5 interview with CNN. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone.”

The Diocese of Chicago has been active in helping immigrant communities and their supporters across northern Illinois respond to the presence of ICE and threats of arrest. A statement released Sept. 10 by a group of diocesan ministry leaders affirmed that Episcopalians in Chicago were “standing in solidarity with immigrants and asylum-seekers.”

“We urge all diocesan churches, clergy, and laity to get involved as we redouble our efforts to welcome the stranger, protect the vulnerable and respect the dignity of every human being,” they said. They referenced an earlier pastoral letter from Chicago Bishop Paula Clark calling on Episcopalians to support “our immigrant siblings.”

“Anxiety and apprehension are rampant in our communities, especially those of people of color, who are affected by these threats. People are afraid to go to church, the grocery store, or even to work,” Clark said in her Aug. 1 letter. “This is not merely about immigration – it is about justice, dignity, and the soul of our diocese.”

The diocese has invited all members to join the prayer vigil at St. Paul and the Redeemer, which starts at 7 p.m. Oct. 7, in support of immigrants like González, the parishioner being held by ICE in Michigan.

González “is a faithful participant in our worship and gives financially to the church every week. He has helped cultivate the earth in our food garden and shared dinners in our homes. We pray and sing together,” the congregation said in its written statement protesting his detention. “Every Sunday we receive the sacrament of Holy Communion together recognizing that we are God’s beloved children created in God’s image, and all have a place at God’s Table.”

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network has raised $5,800 to support González through a GoFundMe campaign. The Diocese of Chicago also worked with the Diocese of the Great Lakes in Michigan to arrange for González to receive a pastoral visit with a priest at the facility.

His next immigration court date is Oct. 8.

“I find myself surprised by all you have done to support me,” González said in a written statement released by the diocese. “It fills me up with hope and I ask God to help me get out of this place. I’m grateful to the church, from the bottom of my heart.”",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ENS_100625_Chicago.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:42.388181

Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown.
Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored.","The US government shutdown entered its second week as the Senate again rejected rival bills to restart funding and Donald Trump suggested he might be open to negotiating with Democrats over the healthcare subsidies they have put at the heart of the stalemate.

A fifth Senate vote to advance a Republican-written bill that would reopen the government failed on a 52-42 tally – well below the 60-vote threshold needed for advancement. The Democrats’ proposal was defeated in a 50-45 party-line vote. No lawmakers changed their votes from recent days, though there were a handful of absences.

Many agencies and departments closed their doors and told employees to stay home last Wednesday, after Congress failed to approve legislation to continue the government’s authority to spend money. The Trump administration warned it was prepared to move forward with plans to slash the federal workforce.

“After five failed votes, Republicans should understand that they cannot go forward unless we come to a bipartisan agreement to address the healthcare crisis,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement after the afternoon votes.

Democrats have refused to back any bill that does not include an array of healthcare-centered concessions, among them, an extension of premium tax credits for people covered by Affordable Care Act health insurance. So far, Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until government funding is restored.

But Trump, speaking from the Oval Office on Monday, said he might be willing to strike a deal with Democrats on the ACA subsidies, though he also echoed the conservative claim that “billions and billions” of dollars are being wasted.

“We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things,” Trump told reporters. “And I’m talking about good things with regard to health care.”

Schumer denied any outreach from the president, and the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, said the White House has been “radio silent” since a meeting with the president last week.

“Trump’s claim isn’t true – but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table,” Schumer said in a statement. “For months, Democrats have been calling on Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to come to the table and work with us to deliver lower costs and better healthcare for the American people.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if the shutdown stretched on, a program thats pays for food for low-income mothers and children would exhaust its funding, while government employees would miss a paycheck, though federal law entitles them to back pay. She also reiterated the Trump administration’s threats to fire federal workers.

“We don’t want to see people laid off. But, unfortunately, if this shutdown continues, layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” Leavitt said.

In the days since the shut down began, Russ Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, has cancelled funding for energy projects in several states, as well as transportations developments in Chicago and New York – all of which are areas governed by Democrats.

But though he warned before funding lapsed that he would use it as an opportunity to deepen cuts to the federal workforce, those have largely not yet taken place.

Asked about when layoffs may be announced, Leavitt replied: “We’ll see how the vote goes tonight.”

Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress have shown no signs of budging from their demands in the days since the shutdown began. Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House on recess for a second straight week, in a bid to pressure Senate Democrats to provide the roughly eight votes the Republican funding bill is expected to need to advance in the upper chamber.

“The ball is in the court of the Senate Democrats. There’s only a handful of people in the country who can solve this problem,” Johnson told a press conference.

The Democratic minority has largely stuck to their demands that any legislation to fund the government includes an extension of the ACA tax credits. Created under Joe Biden, the credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and costs for 20 million enrollees of the plans will rise if they are not extended.

The party has also included in their funding bill a reversal of the Republican cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, as well as a restoration of funding for public media outlets like PBS and NPR, and a prohibition on Donald Trump’s use of a “pocket rescission” to undo congressional appropriations.

Senate’s Republican majority leader John Thune has vowed to continue holding votes on the parties’ bills. No Republicans have supported the Democratic proposal, while only three members of the minority – John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine – have backed the GOP bill.

Several recent polls have shown Democrats with a narrow edge in the public’s opinion of a shutdown. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll found that 53% of respondents held the GOP responsible for the shutdown, as opposed to 47% who blamed the Democrats. Seventy percent of those surveyed opposed the shutdown overall.

Johnson reiterated that he would not call the chamber back into session until government funding is restored. He has also said he will only swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva once the House returns to work.

Grijalva is set to be the 218th lawmaker to sign a petition that will force a vote on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson and Trump oppose releasing the files, and Thomas Massie, an iconoclastic Republican representative who has led the charge to make the documents public, accused Johnson of keeping the House out of session to delay that vote.

“Why are we in recess? Because the day we go back into session, I have 218 votes for the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” Massie said, adding that Johnson “doesn’t want that to be the news”.

""Children were not specifically targeted — they were considered lower priority for enforcement removal because of their age,"" DeCosmo said.","Gina DeCosmo and Jeffery DeCristofaro say the mood is tense in Camden, New Jersey, for many of the families they represent.

""This is something that popped up mid-to-late last week,"" DeCosmo said. ""So those letters could be arriving this week or next.""

They say their concern comes as word that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is allegedly sending letters to teenagers about returning to their home countries.

The staff at Camden Center for Law and Social Justice writes that the ICE notifications, which they say the community has labeled ""Freaky Friday Letters,"" might contain financial offers or strong and threatening language.

""They started being given to youth already in immigration detention starting last Tuesday or Wednesday. They may actually be mailed out now,"" DeCristofaro said.

CBS News Philadelphia also obtained a letter from the Camden School District. Officials there are trying to clear up confusion, recommending families still send their children to school, and in the event they receive a letter from ICE, consult a trusted adult, an advocate or a lawyer.

""Now they're going to be getting letters saying we want you to give up these protections and return home, and those will be frightening for these kids,"" DeCristofaro said.

Attorneys say they haven't seen one of the letters yet. CBS News Philadelphia reached out to a spokesperson for ICE. They responded in part, ""These allegations are categorically false. The anti-ICE activists have made up a ridiculous term, 'Freaky Friday,' to instill fear and spread misinformation.""

The agency went on to explain it is, in fact, offering a voluntary option for unaccompanied children, it says, who were smuggled into the country to return home to their families. CBS News Philadelphia has learned the offer will be made first to 17-year-olds.

ICE says this will allow them to make an informed decision about their future. ICE added any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin.

But staff at the Camden public interest law firm responded that in the statement from ICE, the agency doesn't dispute they're reaching out to those under 18 with an offer.

Members of the law firm explained that this appears to mark a policy change.

Durbin lamented National Guard members being “used as political pawns for the political theater of President Trump,” adding to CNN he believes their deployment isn’t necessary for law and order in his home state of Illinois.

The senator also pointed to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the use of the US military for domestic law enforcement without explicit congressional authorization.

“These men and women in the guard are not trained in law enforcement, because the law does not allow them,” he told John Berman on “CNN News Central.” “Is not fair to them. It’s certainly not fair to the legitimate law enforcement in our state.”

>> What is the Insurrection Act?

The role of local law enforcement is to protect peaceful protesters and their First Amendment rights by “standing between” them and federal officers, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested, “so that ICE and CBP are not firing at them and that we’re doing our best to protect them.”

Federal agents “are creating an environment in which they’re inciting people to do something more than just peacefully protest,” the Democratic governor said Monday during a news conference in his state’s most populous city.

At the request of police in suburban Broadview – where an ICE facility has drawn protests for weeks – and with the help of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the state “sent backup” to protect protesters and residents “who have had ICE and CBP operating in their neighborhoods in an aggressive fashion and interfering with their daily lives,” Pritzker said.

Forty local governments and many of their leaders are asking a federal appeals court to keep National Guard troops out of Portland as the panel decides whether to block a lower court’s order.

On Saturday, District County Judge Karin Immergut blocked the Trump administration from federalizing the Oregon National Guard and sending troops to a Portland immigration facility that has been the site of protests for months.

When the administration responded by trying to move active-duty California National Guard troops to Portland, Immergut expanded her order to prohibit any National Guard deployment in Oregon for two weeks.

Included in the list of officials who signed the amicus brief is Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee. His district includes Memphis, where the Trump administration launched a crime task force of federal law enforcement agents alongside members of the Tennessee National Guard deployed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee.

As of Saturday, 227 arrests had been made by that task force, according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Local prosecutors will struggle to handle the surge in cases, Mulroy said, telling CNN affiliate WMC that the county needs an immediate funding increase to pay for more court hearings.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday blasted the Trump administration for orchestrating a “military-style raid” in Chicago last week, making the argument that the Trump administration uses military assets as “political props.”

The governor pointed to an ICE raid in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, where Black Hawk helicopters and swarms of federal agents in full tactical gear descended on an apartment building.

“In the dead of night and seemingly for the cameras, armed federal agents emerged from the Black Hawk helicopters rappelling onto the roof of that apartment building,” Pritzker said during a news conference, claiming the operation was filmed with high-definition cameras and later posted on social media by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The governor tied the raid to what he described as a broader strategy by the Trump administration to “cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them.”

Pritzker delivered the comments hours after his state and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit to block the deployment of federalized National Guard troops. The governor alleged during the news conference that the Trump administration’s strategy is meant to “create the pretext” for sending troops to the city.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement disputing Pritzker’s claims, accusing him of spreading “hateful rhetoric” and failing to protect law enforcement in Chicago.

“President Trump has the authority under the Constitution to deploy troops, wherever they’re stationed, to defend federal facilities from attacks,” the DHS said.

In a hearing Monday, US District Judge April Perry in Illinois gave the Trump administration until the end of the day Wednesday to file arguments on why she should not block President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago.

Perry was nominated to the federal bench in the Northern District of Illinois last year by President Joe Biden.

A year earlier, Biden had nominated her to serve as the US Attorney for the same district, but that nomination was among those held up by then-Ohio Senator JD Vance, who was blocking Justice Department nominees to protest a federal indictment against Trump brought by former Special Counsel Jack Smith, according to Reuters.

Perry previously served as an assistant US attorney in Illinois’ Northern District for 12 years. Before her 2024 nomination, she worked as the senior counsel of global investigations and fraud and abuse prevention at GE HealthCare in Chicago.

Perry earned her law degree in 2003 from Northwestern University, where she also earned her bachelor’s degree.

President Donald Trump suggested yesterday he could invoke the Insurrection Act if courts continue to block deployments of troops to cities nationwide, raising the prospect of using the centuries-old law to bypass unfavorable rulings.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

Officials in Illinois and Oregon are waging legal battles against Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration yesterday, asking a federal court to halt the federalization of National Guard troops from that state and from Texas, calling the move “patently unlawful.”

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to Portland for the second time, but the Trump administration has asked an appeals court to pause the judge’s order.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2239242013.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-07 08:57:35.903167

Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home.
Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service.""","At 5:30 a.m., the sky was pitch black in downtown Framingham. Five unmarked vehicles — some black, others gray — roamed around with tinted windows and Texas plates.

A group of people who monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were out watching for activity.

One of the observers followed a car she suspected contained federal agents. She recorded a video that showed an officer turning his attention to her, telling her it's dangerous to follow agents at work.

“I'm free to drive around and record in the country,” the woman protested.

“And we are free to find out who you are,” the agent said. “May I see your passport?”

The woman — a U.S. citizen originally from Brazil who we’re identifying by her first initial, A. — presented her passport. The agent ran her name, then told her she could leave.

Immigration advocates say ICE arrests have been surging in Massachusetts since early September, when the Department of Homeland Security announced a renewed enforcement effort in the state. Reports have flooded social media of people arrested at courthouses, during traffic stops and on their way to work.

Connected through a community group called LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, activists — like the ones gathered early in the morning in Framingham — are documenting arrests throughout the state. LUCE volunteers operate a hotline and monitor social media for reports of ICE activity, then dispatch local observers to the scene. Once they get information, they report back to the larger group, and keep notes of everything they see.

According to LUCE, there are hundreds of “ICE watchers” at work, recording the names of those arrested to make sure they’re accounted for. Volunteers canvass neighborhoods in the wake of ICE activity. They say federal agents often arrest family breadwinners, leaving spouses and children in need of help, and LUCE tries to connect them with resources.

LUCE says it’s been getting about 100 calls a day since early September. The wee hours of the morning are often the most active, and MetroWest is one of several hotspots in eastern Massachusetts.

WBUR agreed to use only the first name or initial of the people interviewed for this story — they’re concerned that they or family members could be targeted based on their immigration status.

M. is a British-born U.S. citizen who has lived here for 25 years. And he said he was never an activist until now.

“ICE can just show up and start asking people for their papers,” M. said. “That's not the country that this is supposed to be. That's Eastern Europe in the ‘80s. I don't want us to go to that.”

The agency didn’t respond to questions for this story; ICE has said previously that agents are in Massachusetts arresting “rapists, child abusers, drug traffickers, and other violent thugs.”

But the agency provides almost no details on the people agents arrest. During the last enforcement surge in Massachusetts in May, ICE announced about half of the 1,500 detainees had “significant criminal convictions or charges,” either in the U.S. or abroad. Federal data show that ICE classified the vast majority of men in detention in Massachusetts as not a ""threat.""

M. said it’s understandable that the government wants to hold immigrants accountable to the country’s laws. But he said communities are being uprooted and it’s hard to make sense of why.

“The government has turned a blind eye to people living here 20, 30, 40 years — and then suddenly [is] just rounding them up,” he said. “They're clearly contributing to the community in really big ways.”

He said two days earlier, nine landscapers were arrested in the town of Hopedale, outside of Framingham.

The ICE watchers were on edge this Friday morning in late September — two days before, there was a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas — and the observers know the ICE officers were probably on edge, too.

The top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts, U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, has warned that impeding an arrest or assaulting an agent can be a criminal offense.

M. said the group’s role is to bear witness, not interfere.

Driving around Framingham, he listened to voice messages in a group chat about the latest ICE sighting.

He explained the agents seem to travel in groups of five or six vehicles. One agent who wears a cowboy hat is referred to as “El Vaquero de Marlborough,” the cowboy of Marlborough; the ICE watchers call another agent “Sooner,” an agent who apparently told observers she comes from Oklahoma.

Most of the vehicles spotted by the ICE watchers over the past month have been unmarked Dodge Chargers and Durangos or Ford Explorers. Many have out-of-state plates, mostly from Texas, but also Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire.

Rumors of ICE sightings are rampant. One report claimed there were agents inside Waltham district court, but they turned out to be local cops. Someone else said a large number of federal agents were gathering at a hotel, but ICE watchers found it was some kind of police conference.

Then, M. got a call that sounded legit.

“ICE is at the Milford courthouse,” the caller said, adding two other details: blue Nissan Rogue and the officer was in plain clothes.

M. headed for Milford — a half hour south of Framingham — a town the ICE watchers say has been swarmed by immigration police in recent weeks. In front of the Milford courthouse, several ICE watchers said a female agent had just rushed out and crossed the street.

Three unmarked vehicles surrounded a small Ford. The ICE watchers ran over with their phones out, recording. Agents were pulling a man out of the car and handcuffing him. He shouted his name out.

The agents moved fast, pushing the man into their vehicle before speeding off.

A woman left in the driver’s seat of the Ford Focus looked shocked. She said her name is Mirella and she’d driven her friend Jesus up from Baltimore for a court date.

“ That was my first time ever experiencing that and seeing that,” Mirella said. “That is insane.”

Jesus' lawyer asked WBUR to use just his first name because she fears he could face retaliation by ICE. Court records show Jesus was facing charges for domestic violence and witness intimidation; the case was dismissed right before ICE grabbed him.

Mirella said she was waiting in the car when Jesus walked out of court. She said the agents seemed to be after someone else.

“They asked him if he was a completely different person,” she said. And “they just took him instead.”

ICE didn’t respond to questions about the arrest.

Mirella told the ICE watchers Jesus had the gas money she needed to drive home. One of them took up a collection, then handed Mirella a stack of 20s. It was enough for tolls and gas, plus a couple meals on the way to Baltimore.

But there was more work to be done. That afternoon, the ICE watchers got ahold of Jesus’ mother and sent her video of his arrest. That’s how his lawyer, Baltimore-based Hayley Tamburello, found out he was in custody.

Tamburello said he was flown to an ICE facility in Buffalo, and then to another in Natchez, Mississippi.

On Monday morning, 10 days after the arrest, Tamburello said neither her, nor Jesus' mother, has received a call from him. She doesn't know if that's because he can't make a phone call, or because he doesn't have their numbers memorized.

Tamburello said the ICE watchers provide ""an important service."" If it hadn’t been for them, she said, she doesn’t know how they would have found out what happened to Jesus.

""I wouldn't have known,"" Tamburello said. ""I can tell you that.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0926_ice-fram-3-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 10:56:54.084693

“On Saturday, he was released,” said Constanza Segovia of Victor Sanchez Sr., who was arrested last month at a routine immigration check-in.

Segovia said Sanchez was ordered to leave the country within 30 days, but “we're going to keep fighting.”

She read a statement provided by Sanchez in both Spanish and English.

“I am so happy to be back with family and the community,” Segovia read. “I went to Mass yesterday, and when they saw me, they hugged me, and the priest said, ‘Oh my God, I can't believe you're here.’ I want to share this, because miracles can happen through unity and our community coming together.”

Sanchez’s was one of several recent arrests, as ICE activity in Connecticut has increased since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term in January.

Faith leaders speak out

Monday’s demonstration began with a vigil outside the Abraham A. Ribicoff Federal Building in downtown Hartford, which houses a federal courthouse, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, and other federal offices. Participants then marched to the state Capitol, chanting “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”

The Rev. Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester said the crowd gathered in opposition to federal immigration policy and actions. Pawelek is a member of the steering committee for the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance, which organized the rally along with Connecticut For All.

“Immigrant communities are under attack,” Pawelek said. “The current federal administration is reveling in cruel, violent, racist assaults on the dignity and humanity of immigrants in this country.”

ICE has consistently claimed to be targeting “the worst of the worst.” NPR reported in July that tens of thousands of those arrested by ICE lack a criminal record.

“They are intentionally creating suffering, terror, trauma and chaos in some of our most vulnerable communities,” Pawelek said. “It is racist, it is un-American, it is unacceptable.”

The Rev. Jocelyn Gardner Spencer said her faith impelled her to speak out against what she sees as federal policies that fly in the face of her religious teachings.

“Every person facing the racist, cruel, violent actions of ICE enforcement that my tax dollars and yours are paying for is somebody's baby, as deserving of protection and love and care as mine,” she said. “And every time somebody's baby is harmed, it breaks not only human hearts, it breaks God's heart, too.”

“We will pray and we will march and we will speak truth to power, and we will show up as many times as it takes until our leaders do what is right and not what is easy, what is faithful and not what is expedient,” Spencer said.

Four demands for state lawmakers

Pawelek and others called on Gov. Ned Lamont to call a special session to strengthen protections under state law for undocumented residents. Pawelek listed four main demands.

“One is: safeguard the personal data of Connecticut residents, such as those with drive-only licenses or HUSKY health care or in-state tuition,” Pawelek said. “Two, protect access to our justice system by prohibiting ICE enforcement actions in state courthouses.”

“Three, close loopholes that allow state and local resources to indirectly support federal immigration enforcement, and finally, maintain funding for HUSKY so that no one loses coverage.”

“Governor Lamont’s focus continues to be on making sure all Connecticut residents feel safe in our schools, places of worship, and elsewhere,” Rivera said. “Just a few weeks ago, the Governor along with Supreme Court Chief Justice Mullins announced additional protections in our courthouses to prevent warrantless arrests and banning the use of masks.”

The detainees include 216 Pakistanis, 68 Bangladeshis and six Nepalis.

The protest reportedly stemmed from racist remarks made by Chinese supervisors toward workers’ religions at the workplace.

The county enters the final year of its contracts with ICE and the GEO Group as the Trump administration has intensified efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.

Moshannon — which had already been accused of physical and psychological abuse, inadequate health care, and poor conditions — has also come under increased scrutiny over the past several months after the hanging death of Chaofeng Ge, a Chinese citizen who was detained at the facility near Philipsburg.

Local advocates have protested, called for Moshannon’s closure, and pressured county commissioners not to renew the contracts for the detention center.

Abigail Grimes-Haldiman, who is part of Indivisible Mayday, told Spotlight PA that no amount of money justifies the facility staying open. Indivisible Mayday is a grassroots organization that protests what it deems to be right-wing agendas.

“We don’t have to evoke human suffering in order to make money for the county,” Grimes-Haldiman said.

In September 2021, the Clearfield County commissioners voted to enter into a five-year intergovernmental service agreement with ICE “to provide detention services for detainees,” according to the agreement.

The commissioners also approved a services contract with GEO Group, an international company based in Florida that owns and operates correctional and detention facilities around the globe. It “requires GEO to perform all duties and accept all responsibilities incumbent upon” the county under its agreement with ICE, according to the contract.

The ACLU sued the commissioners after they signed the contracts with ICE and GEO Group, alleging commissioners violated the state’s open meetings law.

Also under the contract, GEO Group agrees to pay the county an administrative fee of $200,000 per year “in recognition of [county] costs in time and resources.”

That $200,000 yearly payment accounts for less than 0.5% of Clearfield County’s annual budget. The county projected revenues of $41.7 million in 2025.

The administrative fee goes into the county’s general fund and isn’t earmarked for any specific purpose, Clearfield County Commissioner Dave Glass told Spotlight PA.

USA Today reported that GEO Group billed the federal government $4.5 million in December, which was about on par for most of the other months in 2024. But in 2025, those monthly payments have been on an upward trajectory, reaching $5.3 million in May.

That money essentially passes from ICE to Clearfield County to GEO Group.

The contract “helps GEO to circumvent onerous federal contracting requirements that exist when a private company directly contracts with the federal government,” according to an August 2024 report from Temple University’s Sheller Center for Social Justice.

The detention center contracts run through the end of next September, and Clearfield County commissioners will decide next year whether they will be renewed.

“All things being equal, I anticipate my advocating a renewal of the contract as I do not believe that the resident detainees’ civil rights are being violated at GEO and I do believe that they are receiving all other protections afforded to them by American law on the part of the institution,” Commissioner John Sobel told Spotlight PA.

Commissioner Tim Winters told Spotlight PA that he didn’t see a reason not to renew the contract.

While Glass said he’s generally happy with GEO Group, he has concerns about the way ICE agents have been conducting themselves and said they would give him pause before voting to renew contracts for the Moshannon facility.

Glass told Spotlight PA he understands deporting known criminals or individuals with criminal connections who have had due process.

“But rounding people up who have been upstanding members of American communities for years — in some cases decades — makes no sense to me and seems like a serious overreaction,” Glass said.

According to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, as of mid-September the most recent average daily population numbers for Moshannon are 1,404 — up from 1,171 when Trump was inaugurated.

(TRAC is a nonprofit that tracks federal agency data, including on immigration.)

The facility has a capacity of 1,876, according to GEO Group’s website.

It was previously owned and operated by GEO Group as a federal prison until March 2021, when former President Joe Biden signed an executive order banning private prison contracts.

The prison employed 300 people before it closed, WPSU reported.

Eight months later, the facility reopened as an ICE immigration detention center.

Sobel said in 2021 that the move would offer “well-paying, family sustaining jobs” to many of the former prison employees, according to the newsroom.

He told Spotlight PA that Moshannon Valley Processing Center “has a great economic impact.”

According to Winters, the facility employs 407 full-time GEO Group employees and about two dozen full-time ICE employees. He said it also pays property taxes that go to the Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District and fund “essential services” in Decatur Township.",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8xMC8wMW1lLTg0YzctYm1nai14ZnFkLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 04:56:40.342413

The new figures have not been finalized by the Trump administration or officially transmitted in a notification to Congress as required by last week's deadline, according to two people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss it with the media.

Trump suspended the refugee program in January

The refugee program — which once had widespread bipartisan support — was suspended on Trump's first day in office.

Since then, only a trickle of refugees have been admitted to the country, either as part of an ongoing court case seeking to resume the program or as part of a new refugee program for Afrikaners that Trump announced in February. The administration says the white South African farmers face discrimination and violence at home, which the country's government strongly denies.

The White House said the refugee cap is not final until the administration consults with Congress, according to an official granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The official and one of the other people said due to the federal government shutdown, no refugees will be admitted during the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, until the government is reopened, although with the program suspended, few are being let in as is.

Some 128,000 refugees have currently been approved for resettlement in the United States and are now stuck in limbo, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency. In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.

""How can a president who claims to stand for religious and American values and who claims to support legal and orderly migration turn his back on so many refugees who followed the rules, while moving white South Africans to the front of the line?"" he said.

The expected admissions are lower than advocates hoped

The 7,500 number is a dramatic reduction in the already historically low refugee admission caps that Trump put forward during his first term and also well below what refugee advocates had feared would be the target for the coming fiscal year.

In early- to mid-September, organizations that assist refugees began sounding the alarm that the administration was considering a cap of roughly 30,000, with most of those spots reserved for white South Africans.

Administration officials said at the time that the numbers were in flux and would require White House sign off, but gave no indication that the total number could be slashed by more than 20,000 from what the advocates had feared.

As the government shutdown loomed last week, these officials began to say that no final determination would be made until Congress had been consulted and that that was unlikely until after the shutdown ended.

One senior U.S. official said Saturday such consultation is still required and would not likely occur until the government goes back to work.

But the official also noted that 7,500 admissions in the current fiscal year would be ""significantly more"" than had been allowed in since Trump took office for the second time in January.

Other refugees may be left in limbo

Certain lawmakers in Congress have been pressing the White House for the official notification, which was required by law by the Sept. 30 deadline.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters said the Trump administration is ""in open defiance of the law.""

Refugees are being left in ""limbo,"" wrote Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels in a letter last week. ""The consequences are dire.""

They said thousands of people facing persecution abroad, ""who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements,"" are being left to languish in refugee camps while Trump is ""carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.""

CHICAGO — During the summer of 2025, the Trump Administration has deployed federal forces to cities across the United States with announced missions to deter crime and enforce immigration laws. These federal forces, however, have used violent force against the press, elected officials, religious leaders, and private individuals engaged in peaceful and protected activities.

These federal forces are not trained to conduct local policing, and their tactics involve the indiscriminate use of force and arresting people without any legal basis.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center in Broadview, IL, has been the site of peaceful, constitutionally protected activity for decades, Over the summer of 2025, as a result of reports of inhumane conditions for detainees inside the facility, protesters have gathered to demand the closure of the facility. These protests have been peaceful and non-threatening.

In recent weeks, however, the Trump Administration has sent federal officials and agents to brutally suppress free speech at the site through intentional and escalating violence, including the dangerous and indiscriminate use of near-lethal weapons such as tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper-balls, flash grenades, and other unwarranted and disproportionate tactics.

A new lawsuit filed this morning argues that this wanton violence by the federal government is a blatant attempt to interfere with the most cherished and fundamental rights enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief, and the right to peaceably assemble and express disagreement with the government.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint states.

Today’s lawsuit is being brought by members of the press, as well as by individuals representing clergy and ordinary citizens who have chosen to speak in opposition to the Trump Administration’s policies, and who now come together to courageously stand up for the First Amendment rights of all Americans. These include:

Media organizations and outlets such as Block Club Chicago, Chicago Headline Club, the Chicago Newspaper Guild Local 34071, the National Association of Broadcast Employees & Technicians Local 54041, and individual journalists whose attempts to report the truth have been met with targeted attacks and widespread government violence.

Stephanie Lulay, Executive Editor and Co-Founder of Block Club Chicago, says her outlet has allocated a significant portion of its resources to covering DHS actions at the protests since September 19.

“During that time, at least four of our employees or freelancers have told me that they were hit with pepper balls and subjected to tear gas by federal agents at Broadview,” Ms. Lulay reports. “We intend to continue to report on the protests, but our ability to do so, to the standards that we hold ourselves to, continues to be impacted by our fears of violence and arrests of our employees and contractors.”

Members of the clergy, such as Pastor David Black of the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago in the Woodlawn neighborhood, whose peaceful, free expression of his religion has led to his being shot repeatedly in the head with near-lethal projectiles and sprayed in the face with tear gas.

“I extended my arms, palms outstretched toward the ICE officers, in a traditional Christian posture of prayer and blessing,” Pastor Black recalls. “Without any warning, and without any order or request that I and others disperse, I was suddenly fired upon by ICE officers. In rapid fire, I was hit seven times on my arms, face and torso with exploding pellets that contained some kind of chemical agent. It was clear to me that the officers were aiming for my head, which they struck twice.”

Individual protesters, such as William Paulson, a 67-year-old retired union painter, who says he went to the protests because he “wanted to appeal to the humanity of the federal agents at the facility and express that what they were doing was wrong on a moral basis.”

On Sept. 27, Mr. Paulson was there when ICE agents launched an indiscriminate attack on the protesters without audible warning. “Gas canisters had been shot in front of and behind me,” he recalls. “I started to inhale the gas, and I couldn’t see or breathe. Around me, I could hear people being tackled to the ground. Then, flash bang grenades started to go off near me. I was disoriented…My eyes and nose were burning…I fell to all fours and threw up. My eyes and nose were in extreme pain. My skin was burning. I have emphysema and COPD, so the gas affected me very strongly.” Mr. Paulson says he tried to go back the next day but could only stay a few minutes before having to leave. “I felt afraid the entire time I was there,” he says.

The complaint names as defendants Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Kristi Noem; Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons; Acting Executive Associate Director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Marcos Charles; ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Russell Hott; Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Gregory Bovino; Attorney General of the United States Pam Bondi; individual agents of ICE, CBP, DHS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Justice who have largely concealed their identities and culpability behind masks; and Donald Trump, President of the United States.

The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Loevy + Loevy, the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, the Mandel Legal Aid Clinic of the University of Chicago School of Law, First Defense Legal Aid, Protect Democracy, and the ACLU of Illinois.

The attorneys are also filing an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, asking the court for immediate, injunctive relief against the government’s violent suppression of free speech.

A similar motion was filed and granted in Los Angeles last month, after federal troops deployed the same sorts of tactics against journalists and protesters.

President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard into several US cities has drawn a round of legal challenges by state and local officials.

Trump argues the use of federal troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.

But several Democratic governors have pushed back, saying the deployments are unnecessary and risk escalating tensions.

Illinois filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a judge to block the deployment of troops to Chicago, while a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members from Texas and California to Portland, Oregon.

As the legal battles continue, here's what to know about the National Guard:

What is the National Guard and who oversees it?

The National Guard consists of primarily state-based troops that typically respond to issues like natural disasters or large protests.

All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have their own contingent of National Guard troops. Those troops also can be deployed abroad, and some units specialise in fighting wildfires or securing the US border.

Though the National Guard ultimately reports to the Department of Defence, and the president can federalise troops in certain circumstances, requests for its support typically start at a local level.

The governor of a state makes the call to activate National Guard troops during an emergency, and can request additional help from the president or other states.

National Guard troops have limited power, however. They do not enforce the law, or make arrests, seizures, or searches. And a law called the Posse Comitatus Act limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.

How is Trump trying to use the National Guard in cities?

Trump has tried to circumvent the normal process for deploying the National Guard several times now.

In June, he took control of the California National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom objected. California filed two lawsuits against the Trump administration.

One lawsuit challenged Trump's seizure of the National Guard, but an appeals court ultimately ruled in favour of the president. In a second lawsuit, a federal judge found that Trump's use of the National Guard troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

This summer, hundreds of National Guard troops arrived in Washington, DC because of what he called a ""situation of complete and total lawlessness."" Trump cited homelessness and crime rates as justification.

Trump has now authorised the deployment of 300 National Guard to Chicago following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities. Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, alleged Trump is trying to ""manufacture a crisis"" and has filed a lawsuit.

This week, Trump attempted to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, before a federal judge temporarily blocked the action late Sunday night.

What legal basis does Trump use to deploy the National Guard?

A little-known provision of US military law governs the president's authority to deploy the National Guard on his own. But up until now, presidents rarely used it.

10 US Code § 12406 allows the president to call National Guard troops from any state into service if the US is ""invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,"" or ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion"" against the US government.

Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.

""We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October. ""And we're very confident we will win on the merits of the law.""

Why does Trump want to use the National Guard in Portland?

Trump is again seeking to use the National Guard to respond to demonstrations, after protests near an ICE building in Portland over the weekend.

Federal officers, including with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol agency, clashed with demonstrators who opposed Trump's mass deportation initiative.

The Portland Police Bureau said it arrested two people on 4 October who engaged ""in aggressive behaviour toward each other in the street"" and refused to follow orders. One person was in possession of bear spray and a collapsable baton.

Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.

Trump has claimed the city is ""burning down,"" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said ""there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.""

The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.

But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.

On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. ""This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,"" she wrote in her ruling.

The next day, she issued a temporary restraining order against him deploying California's National Guard in Portland instead.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e454/live/a48a95e0-a2ed-11f0-8009-71dc5acedc16.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:57:04.557483

The artificial nature of France’s immigration divide becomes clear when comparing political rhetoric with policy outcomes and public opinion.
Despite decades of heated debate, French immigration levels remain relatively stable.","Immigration is a highly contentious and contested issue in France. During the past 20 years, 12 laws have been introduced aimed at bringing about an ever more restrictive approach to immigration — and yet every poll keeps showing the French want ever stricter border control. That is despite France no longer being a major destination country. Although 10.7% of its population is foreign-born, the annual immigration rate into France (the ratio between immigrant inflows and the total population of the country) amounted to 0.37% in 2023 and is among the lowest in OECD countries. It is three times as low as countries such as Belgium (1.06%), Canada (1.06%) or Germany (1.37%).

A closer examination of the apparent polarisation around immigration shows it is largely driven by a strategic political positioning to transform the immigration issue from a practical policy matter into a symbolic battleground. As political parties struggle to retain their voters, they use immigration to activate the left-right division, generating rather than reflecting genuine societal cleavage.

The illusion of left-right opposition

At first glance, France’s political spectrum appears neatly divided on immigration, with the left advocating for humanitarian concerns, while the right emphasises control and security. This binary presentation fails to capture the complexity of public opinion and policy realities.

Firstly, immigration ranks relatively low among French citizens’ primary concerns. Surveys repeatedly show that economic issues (particularly purchasing power), healthcare system pressures, and climate change consequences dominate the public’s attention. In IPSOS-CESE polling for issues of public concern, immigration is in sixth position, with only 18% of respondents ranking immigration as their primary concern. It typically appears as a secondary concern, often influenced more by media coverage and political campaigns than by direct personal experience. This suggests that the political emphasis on immigration may be disproportionate to its actual importance in citizens’ daily lives.

Secondly, annual surveys on racism show consistent progress towards greater societal understanding and tolerance. The Longitudinal Tolerance Index, published by the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH), shows a rise in the level of tolerance towards foreigners since 1990, with younger generations more exposed to foreign cultures displaying the highest levels.

Lastly, contrary to the heated political discourse, French public opinion demonstrates significant consensus on key immigration issues. Polling consistently shows that majorities across political affiliations support targeted immigration to address labour shortages in specific sectors, from healthcare to agriculture. According to the think tank Terra Nova, 58% of the population is in favour of labour immigration — selected or not — with the number rising to 70% among those who are acquainted with immigrants. Similarly, there is broad agreement on the need to reduce irregular immigration and improve the efficiency of asylum procedures.

Most citizens support skilled migration programs, family reunification within reasonable limits, and humanitarian protection for refugees. Even on contentious issues like integration requirements, polling reveals more agreement than disagreement, with most French citizens supporting language learning and civic education programs rather than opposing immigration entirely.

The disconnect between the intensity of political rhetoric and the public’s priorities indicates that the immigration debate serves a political agenda beyond addressing genuine public concerns. It provides a convenient arena for political competition and identity formation, allowing parties to differentiate themselves on symbolic grounds while avoiding more complex economic and social policy discussions.

The historical evolution of immigration governance

Understanding France’s current immigration politics requires examining how migration governance has evolved since the early twentieth century. From the 1920s through to the post-war period, immigration was primarily managed by employers and business associations who recruited foreign workers based on economic needs with minimal political interference. This system, while imperfect, maintained immigration as a largely technical and economic matter rather than a political issue.

Following World War II, civil society organisations increasingly assumed roles in immigrant integration and advocacy. Organisations like CIMADE (Comité Inter-Mouvements Auprès Des Évacués) emerged to assist refugees and migrants, creating a parallel support system that complemented official policies. This period saw immigration managed through a combination of economic pragmatism and humanitarian solidarity, with limited political controversy.

However, during the 1980s, there was a marked turning point with the gradual state centralisation of immigration policy and the rise of the far-right National Front (FN). Immigration shifted from being a primarily economic and humanitarian concern to a central political issue. This transformation coincided with economic restructuring, urban challenges, and the search for new political identities in post-industrial France.

The consequences of this shift have been profound. Business unions, once vocal advocates for immigration to meet labour needs, have largely withdrawn from public debate, preferring to manage their workforce needs quietly. The left has become increasingly fragmented, torn between humanitarian principles, economic realities, and electoral concerns about appearing too permissive. Meanwhile, civil society organisations find themselves marginalised in a political environment that prioritises partisan positioning over practical solutions.

The security-focused vacuum

This institutional transformation has created a political vacuum that right-wing and far-right parties have successfully filled by framing immigration exclusively through security and cultural preservation lenses. Without strong voices advocating for economic pragmatism or humanitarian balance, the debate has shifted toward restrictive policies justified by security concerns and identity politics.

The artificial nature of France’s immigration divide becomes clear when comparing political rhetoric with policy outcomes and public opinion. Despite decades of heated debate, French immigration levels remain relatively stable. Net migration in 2021 amounted to 159,000 persons in 2021, against 163,000 in 2006. In practice, policymakers have fully endorsed the European agenda on migration, with stricter visa requirements, enhanced collaborations with sending and transit states to secure deportation, and an integration policy limited to language courses and civic training.

With a legislative reform every two years on average, in addition to the constant parliamentary debates ramped up by daily media coverage of stories involving immigrants, anti-immigration rhetoric has become dominant and is constantly being reiterated.

This political frenzy over immigration has done more to reactivate and drive the left-right divide than address the public’s concerns. The latest example of this is the recent petition launched by Philippe De Villiers, a far-right pundit, demanding the organisation of a referendum on immigration lest “we change population … lifestyle … civilisation”.

The petition has been largely promoted by conservative media outlets such as Cnews, Europe 1 and Valeurs Actuelles. It garnered 1.9 million signatures, but that number is questionable because it was posted on a non-secure website that allowed multiple signatures by the same person (or bot). All signatories had to automatically agree to their contact details being used by some conservative media outlets to allow them to send newsletters and other commercial material. The endeavour was yet another marketing operation meant to mobilise supporters.

The experience of France shows how poorly performing institutions and political strategies have prevented effective governance of a complex social issue. This has left France with a highly divided left-right battleground, leading to social fracturing that transcends reality on immigration — an issue that enjoys an underlying relative consensus.",https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/immig.jpg?quality=70&w=1024,N,,2025-10-07 02:57:01.607799

The groups called the law an important act of leadership during these times of unprecedented threats to immigrant families.

The resolution prioritizes public safety and human dignity by ensuring city resources go towards community needs rather than sowing fear and division. It codifies policies already implemented by the city to ensure city resources, like the Las Cruces Police Department, are not voluntarily utilized for federal immigration enforcement raids and mass deportations unless required by law.

The resolution also provides protections for all residents’ sensitive personal information, affirms the city’s commitment to uphold residents’ constitutional rights, and prioritizes transparency and accountability in city operations.

“All of us want to feel safe in our communities, but Trump’s deliberate attacks that terrorize and vilify our immigrant neighbors completely erode our public safety,” said Johana Bencomo, mayor pro tem and city councilor for District 4 of the City of Las Cruces. “Las Cruces will continue to fight back against the president's attempt to divide our community. Together we can ensure that everyone—from the family who has been here for generations to the one who just arrived—has stable housing, good jobs, and safe, thriving neighborhoods.""

“The Las Cruces Welcoming City resolution is reflective of our values as New Mexicans: inclusivity, respect, and unity. We are grateful for New Mexico's state leadership and the many local officials who are standing up to Trump's mass detention campaign,” said Tatiana Prieto, policy advocate with the ACLU of New Mexico. “We urge all municipalities to push back against harmful policies by enacting similar legislation, acknowledging the urgent need for state-level protections. We must commit to protecting the rights, dignity, and safety of all people in New Mexico.""

The following quote can be attributed to the New Mexico Dream Team: “Las Cruces has been a leader in putting a people-first approach when it comes to housing, healthcare access, services like public transportation and community infrastructure. The introduction of the Welcoming Community Resolution reaffirms that Las Cruces is a city that loves immigrants, mixed-status families, and people of color and will take the proactive steps to support them. We wholeheartedly support the Las Cruces City Council in the passage of this resolution.”

The following quote can be attributed to the Doña Ana County NAACP: ""We support the 'Las Cruces Welcoming City' resolution because it represents a meaningful commitment to inclusion, respect, and dignity for everyone in our community. By embracing diversity and rejecting discrimination, the resolution fosters a sense of belonging for all residents, regardless of their background.

“You cannot serve time for a crime in immigration detention.” __ Mustian reported from New York","BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The immigration detainees sent to a notorious Louisiana prison last month are being punished for crimes for which they have already served time, the American Civil Liberties Union said Monday in a lawsuit challenging the government’s decision to hold what it calls the “worst of the worst” there.

The lawsuit accuses President Donald Trump's administration of selecting the former slave plantation known as Angola for its “uniquely horrifying history"" and intentionally subjecting immigrant detainees to inhumane conditions — including foul water and lacking basic necessities — in violation of the Double Jeopardy clause, which protects people from being punished twice for the same crime.

The ACLU also alleges some immigrants detained at the newly opened “Louisiana Lockup” should be released because the government failed to deport them within six months of a removal order. The lawsuit cites a 2001 Supreme Court ruling raised in several recent immigration cases, including that of the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, that says immigration detention should be ""nonpunitive.""

“The anti-immigrant campaign under the guise of ‘Making America Safe Again’ does not remotely outweigh or justify indefinite detention in ‘America’s Bloodiest Prison’ without any of the rights afforded to criminal defendants,” ACLU attorneys argue in a petition reviewed by The Associated Press.

The AP sent requests for comment to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.

The lawsuit comes a month after state and federal authorities gathered at the sprawling Louisiana State Penitentiary to announce that the previously shuttered prison complex had been refurbished to house up to 400 immigrant detainees that officials said would include some of the most violent in ICE custody.

The complex had been nicknamed “the dungeon” because it previously held inmates in solitary cells for more than 23 hours a day.

ICE repurposed the facility amid an ongoing legal battle over an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” and as Trump continues his large-scale attempt to remove millions of people suspected of entering the country illegally. The federal government has been racing to to expand its deportation infrastructure and, with state allies, has announced other new facilities, including what it calls the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana and the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska. ICE is seeking to detain 100,000 people under a $45 billion expansion Trump signed into law in July.

At Angola last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters the “legendary” maximum security prison, the largest in the nation, had been chosen to house a new ICE facility to encourage people in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. “This facility will hold the most dangerous of criminals,” she said.

Authorities said the immigration detainees would be isolated from Angola's thousands of civil prisoners, many of whom are serving life sentences for violent offenses.

“I know you all in the media will attempt to have a field day with this facility, and you will try to find everything wrong with our operation in an effort to make those who broke the law in some of the most violent ways victims,"" Landry, a Republican, said during a news conference last month.

“If you don’t think that they belong in somewhere like this, you’ve got a problem.""

The ACLU lawsuit says detainees at “Louisiana Lockup” already were “forced to go on hunger strike” to “demand basic necessities such as medical care, toilet paper, hygiene products and clean drinking water.” Detainees have described a long-neglected facility that was not yet prepared to house them, saying they are contending with mold, dust and ”black"" water coming out of showers, court records show.

Federal and state officials have said those claims are part of a “false narrative” created by the media, and that the hunger strike only occurred after inaccurate reporting.

The lawsuit was filed in Baton Rouge federal court on behalf of Oscar Hernandez Amaya, a 34-year-old Honduran man who has been in ICE custody for two years. He was transferred to “Louisiana Lockup” last month from an ICE detention center in Pennsylvania.

Amaya fled Honduras two decades ago after refusing the violent MS-13 gang's admonition “to torture and kill another human being,” the lawsuit alleges. The gang had recruited him at age 12, court documents say.

Amaya came to the United States, where he worked “without incident” until 2016. He was arrested that year and later convicted of attempted aggravated assault and sentenced to more than four years in prison. He was released on good-time credits after about two years and then transferred to ICE custody.

An immigration judge this year awarded Amaya “Convention Against Torture” protection from being returned to Honduras, the lawsuit says, but the U.S. government has failed to deport him to another country.

“The U.S. Supreme Court has been very clear that immigration detention cannot be used for punitive purposes,” Nora Ahmed, the ACLU of Louisiana’s legal director, told AP. “You cannot serve time for a crime in immigration detention.”

When powerful states or their allies disregard international humanitarian law without consequence, they erode the credibility of the entire system and weaken protections for civilians in armed conflicts elsewhere, Human Rights Watch said.
All governments should act to prevent further atrocities and to uphold the universality of human rights.","Human Rights Watch – October 6, 2025 – United States President Donald Trump’s “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict,” announced on September 29, 2025, is no substitute for the urgent action governments need to take to protect civilians and support justice after two years of grave abuses in Israel and Palestine, Human Rights Watch said today.

The 20-part plan does not directly address human rights issues or accountability for serious crimes committed since October 7, 2023.

Governments should be taking immediate measures, including arms embargoes, targeted sanctions, and support for the International Criminal Court (ICC), in accordance with their international legal obligations to prevent and stop violations by the parties regardless of whether the Trump plan goes forward.

“The two years since October 7, 2023, have brought a seemingly endless stream of atrocities against civilians for which there has been no letup or justice,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch. “Governments should not wait for the adoption of Trump’s or any other plan to take action to prevent further harm to those most at risk.”

Atrocity crimes in Israel and Palestine over the past two years have taken a devastating toll on civilians with thousands killed, maimed, starved, forcibly displaced, and unlawfully held hostage or detained; towns and neighborhoods levelled to the ground; and countless communities and lives devastated, Human Rights Watch said.

Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups gunned down several hundred civilians at festivals and in their homes across two dozen communities in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attacks. Scores of civilians were taken hostage, and many are still held, including those starving in tunnels.

Human Rights Watch found in its July 2024 report that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and unlawful imprisonment.

Governments with influence over Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups should press for the urgent release of civilian hostages, an ongoing war crime, Human Rights Watch said.

In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, most of them civilians, including decimating entire families and killing on average the equivalent of an entire classroom of children each day.

Military operations in Gaza have left most of the territory in ruins, flattening entire neighborhoods and towns and severely damaging or destroying most homes, schools, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure.

Israeli authorities have caused a famine, using starvation as a weapon of war, and forcibly displaced virtually the entire population multiple times.

The United Nations, human rights organizations, and the media have repeatedly reported Israeli authorities’ actions in Gaza that seriously violated international law.

Human Rights Watch found numerous violations of the laws of war amounting to war crimes, crimes against humanity, including extermination, and acts of genocide, and the violation of binding orders by the International Court of Justice.

In the West Bank, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed or maimed, thousands detained, many without trial or charge, and tens of thousands displaced, mostly by Israeli forces, but also by settlers.

The scale of destruction in Gaza and the patterns of attacks have demonstrated the Israeli government’s contempt for its fundamental obligations under international law.

The failure to uphold these norms has consequences that extend far beyond Israel and Palestine. When powerful states or their allies disregard international humanitarian law without consequence, they erode the credibility of the entire system and weaken protections for civilians in armed conflicts elsewhere, Human Rights Watch said.

All governments should act to prevent further atrocities and to uphold the universality of human rights. They should take steps to halt ongoing abuses and support credible investigations and meaningful accountability for those responsible, including the following measures:

Press Israeli authorities to immediately and unconditionally lift unlawful sweeping restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza.

Press Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups to immediately and unconditionally release all civilians held hostage.

Suspend military assistance and arms transfers to Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups.

Impose targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against Israeli officials and others credibly implicated in ongoing serious violations.

Suspend preferential trade agreements with Israel and ban trade with illegal settlements.

Publicly express support for the ICC and strongly condemn efforts to intimidate its officials and those cooperating with the court or to interfere with its work; commit to support the enforcement of ICC warrants.

“The worsening repression on the ground as decades of ‘peace processes’ played out should have made clear the folly of relying solely on peace plans to address grave abuses,” Shakir said. “Governments urgently need to take concrete action to protect Gaza’s over two million Palestinians and the Israeli hostages.”",https://imemc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HRW-COVER-e1759748622980.png,N,,2025-10-07 02:57:11.079101

The proposed changes better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities. The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass.

The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department. In one such incident, PPD officers were found to have provided “operationally significant” assistance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel performing a raid in the city as part of President Trump’s dangerous nationwide crackdown on undocumented Americans.

After deep research and community engagement, councilors proposed these amendments to ensure that Providence remains a city where all residents can live and thrive without fear.

The proposed changes fall into five major categories:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not normally tasked with immigration who have recently been deputized by the Trump administration in order to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as those directives are accompanied by a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant. The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CPRA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces allows families, and especially youth, to have more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and more specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all of the restrictions set forth in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow certain types of non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CPRA violations by Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

The amendments will now be presented to the full council at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting on Thursday, October 16 for the first of two required passages, along with the committee’s recommendation to pass.",https://council.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Council-Default-2.png,N,,2025-10-06 22:57:10.442258

It’s hard to keep up with this administration’s outrages, on so many fronts. But the effort to target, humiliate and mistreat immigrants may be its most malignant campaign.

Here’s what to know about the fight over Trump’s deployment of the national guard.
The ruling came hours after Trump’s administration announced plans to send hundreds of national guard members from California and Texas to the state.
“The rule of law has prevailed – and California’s national guard will soon be heading home,” Newsom said in a statement on Sunday.
As the president moves ahead with efforts to federalize the Illinois national guard, Chicago could see troops from Texas deployed on Tuesday or Wednesday.","A federal judge on Monday declined to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying national guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, after the state became the latest to try to use the courts to stop Donald Trump from sending in the military.

The decision was the most recent turn in a three-day whirlwind of legal developments over Trump’s efforts to send federal troops to Democratic-led cities.

Here’s what to know about the fight over Trump’s deployment of the national guard.

The rulings

The first major ruling came on Saturday, when US district judge Karin Immergut, in a case brought by the state of Oregon, blocked the Trump administration from mobilizing 200 Oregon national guard troops to Portland, where protesters have gathered in the block surrounding a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement building (Ice) in recent weeks.

In a ruling on Sunday evening, Immergut also granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon, and banned the Trump administration from sending any national guard troops to Portland. .

The ruling came hours after Trump’s administration announced plans to send hundreds of national guard members from California and Texas to the state.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, described the ruling as an important win. “The rule of law has prevailed – and California’s national guard will soon be heading home,” Newsom said in a statement on Sunday. “This ruling is more than a legal victory, it’s a victory for American democracy itself. Donald Trump tried to turn our soldiers into instruments of his political will, and while our fight continues, tonight the rule of law said ‘hell no.’”

Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, seemed incredulous that the president moved to call in national guard troops to Oregon from California and Texas, just hours after she had ruled the first time.

“How could bringing in federalized national guard from California not be in direct contravention to the temporary restraining order I issued yesterday?” she questioned the federal government’s attorney, cutting him off.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she said later. “Why is this appropriate?”

Illinois had followed California and Oregon on Monday in filing lawsuits to stop Trump from sending federal troops to its state. The judge in the case, April M Perry, said in an emergency court hearing later that day that she needed time to review the case before ruling on the state’s request for a restraining order.

The deployments

The Pentagon said on Sunday that 200 guard members were sent from California to Oregon.

Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said 101 California national guard members had arrived in her state on Saturday night by plane and more were on the way. Kotek said there had been no formal communication with the federal government about the deployment, and that she could not verify the location of the guard members.

JB Pritzker had announced on Sunday that Trump had ordered 400 members of the Texas national guard to deploy to Illinois, Oregon and other states, without communicating with the Illinois governor. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, said he “fully authorized” Trump to deploy up to 400 of his state’s national guard to “ensure safety for federal officials”.

As the president moves ahead with efforts to federalize the Illinois national guard, Chicago could see troops from Texas deployed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

The pushback

Small protests have been going on outside the Ice facility in Portland since Trump’s second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups but for weeks nightly demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people.

Far from being “under siege” by militants, there were at times fewer than 10 protesters on the sidewalk on an afternoon this week week. Portland police made three arrests on Thursday night after fistfights broke out between demonstrators and a pro-Trump influencer from Washington DC. On Saturday, about 400 people gathered outside the Ice facility before federal agents shot teargas canisters into the crowd.

Trump, however, has turned his attention to the city, calling Portland a “war-ravaged” city that is “burning down” and like “living in hell”.

Local officials have pointed out that the protest occupies one city block far from the downtown in a city that covers 145 sq miles (375 sq km). They also say many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when unrest that grew out of the Black Lives Matter protests roiled the city for several months. Trump sent federal law enforcement to the city then, as well.

Chicago, too, saw demonstrations over the weekend as residents pushed back against the president’s immigration crackdown with protests outside the Broadview immigration processing center. Officials report federal agents have acted violently toward protesters and the Broadview mayor has enacted a curfew limiting demonstrations outside the facility to certain hours.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, in addition to calling the former a “war zone” he has suggested apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore, Maryland; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans, Louisiana; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

But the governors of Illinois and Oregon see the deployments differently.

Pritzker on Sunday shot back at Kristi Noem, Trump’s homeland security secretary, who reiterated the “war zone” rhetoric. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, the Illinois governor, accused the administration of fueling the crisis rather than resolving it. “They are the ones who are making it a war zone,” he said.

“They need to get out of Chicago. If they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they are going to do, they need to get the heck out.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a294eb807260c56f7059c747b05b05c92ed5b3ea/410_0_4818_3854/master/4818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45299e20a1e9eeee44271a1d457ea282",N,,2025-10-07 00:57:22.215049

But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.
His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.
As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.
“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.","President Trump rocked American politics at the outset of his first campaign when he first labeled his rivals as enemies of the American people. But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.

Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff, declared over the weekend that “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country” is fueling a historic national schism, “shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general.”

“The only remedy,” Miller said, “is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

It was a maxim from an unelected presidential advisor who is already unleashing the federal government in unprecedented ways, overseeing the federalization of police forces and a sweeping deportation campaign challenging basic tenets of civil liberty.

Miller’s rhetoric comes amid a federal crackdown on Portland, Ore., where he says the president has unchecked authority to protect federal lives and property — and as another controversial Trump advisor harnesses an ongoing government shutdown as pretext for the mass firing of federal workers.

Russ Vought, the president’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, plays the grim reaper in an AI video shared by the president, featuring him roving Washington for bureaucrats to cut from the deep state during the shutdown.

His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.

As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.

“We don’t want to see people laid off, but unfortunately, if this shutdown continues layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt said during a news briefing.

‘A nation of Constitutional law’

Karin Immergut, a federal judge appointed by Trump, said this weekend that the administration’s justification for deploying California National Guard troops in Portland was “simply untethered to the facts.”

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote, chiding the Trump administration for attempting to circumvent a prior order from her against a federal deployment to the city.

“This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition,” she added: “This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The administration is expected to appeal the judge’s decision, Leavitt said, while calling the judge’s ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“We’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we are very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” Leavitt said.

If the courts were to side with the administration, Leavitt said local leaders — most of whom are Democrats — should not be concerned about the possibility of long-term plans to have their cities occupied by the military.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place?” Leavitt said. “They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night and the president, all he is trying to do, is fix it.”

Moments later, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that though he does not believe it is necessary yet, he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act “if courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up.”

“Sure, I’d do that,” Trump said. “We have to make sure that our cities are safe.”

The Insurrection Act gives the president sweeping emergency power to deploy military forces within the United States if the president deems it is needed to quell civil unrest. The last time this occurred was in 1992, when California Gov. Pete Wilson asked President George H.W. Bush to send federal troops to help stop the Los Angeles riots that occurred after police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King.

Subsequent posts from Miller on social media over the weekend escalated the stakes to existential heights, accusing Democrats of allying themselves with “domestic terrorists” seeking to overturn the will of the people reflected in Trump’s election win last year.

On Monday, in an interview with CNN, Miller suggested that the administration would continue working to sidestep Immergut’s orders.

“The administration will abide by the ruling insofar as it affects the covered parties,” he said, “but there are also many options the president has to deploy federal resources under the U.S. military to Portland.”

Other Republicans have used similar rhetoric since the slaying of Charlie Kirk, a conservative youth activist, in Utah last month.

Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) wrote that posts from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office have reached “the threshold of domestic terrorism,” after the Democratic governor referred to Miller on social media as a fascist. And Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) said Monday that Democrats demanding an extension of healthcare benefits as a condition for reopening the government were equivalent to terrorists.

“I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” Fine told Newsmax, “and what we’ve learned in whether it’s dealing with Muslim terrorists or Democrats, you’ve gotta stand and you’ve gotta do the right thing.”

Investigating donor networks

Republicans’ keenness to label Democrats as terrorists comes two weeks after Trump signed an executive order declaring a left-wing antifascist movement, known as antifa, as a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not exist under U.S. law.

The order, which opened a new front in Trump’s battle against his political foes, also threatened to investigate and prosecute individuals who funded “any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of antifa.”

Leavitt told reporters Monday that the administration is “aggressively” looking into who is financially backing these operations.

Trump has floated the possibility of going after people such as George Soros, a billionaire who has supported many left-leaning causes around the world.

“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.

The White House has not yet made public any details about a formal investigation into donors, but Leavitt said the administration’s efforts are underway.

“We will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations and this organized anarchy against our country and our government,” Leavitt said. “We are committed to uncovering it.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36854e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5846x3069+0+414/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2F1a%2F378d89684f7295b3d0463342b726%2Ftrump-24897.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 21:56:30.533423

At a panel meeting last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Trump brazenly instructed the attorney general to go after his perceived political enemies, including Comey, Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
That indictment came after Trump made the post demanding that the Justice Department prosecute him.
“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said in the post, addressing the attorney general by her first name.
“In my almost six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the department,” Schiff posted on social media.","A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday is poised to offer an unusual face-off: Sen. Adam B. Schiff, who says he’s being targeted by the president for political retaliation, asking questions of the attorney general whose department would sign off on any charges.

Schiff and the other committee Democrats criticized President Donald Trump’s calls last month to indict Schiff and others, as well as an actual indictment of former FBI Director James B. Comey, as brazen use of the Justice Department’s power to intimidate political foes.

“This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Nixon had his enemies list, but it wasn’t so exhaustive and blatant as this,” Schiff said in a television interview about a Trump social media post that demanded his prosecution. “It’s an effort to try to silence and intimidate people, but I refuse to be silenced or intimidated.”

Trump directed his call for prosecutions at Attorney General Pamela Bondi, who is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time since her confirmation hearing in January.

It’s one of a panoply of issues that Democrats could pick from to ask Bondi, a close Trump ally. Bondi is navigating a torrent of controversies as attorney general, including a decision not to disclose investigative materials related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, the pushing out and firing of career DOJ officials and her role in pressing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.

Bondi could also face questions from Democrats about what happened with an investigation in which the administration’s border czar, Tom Homan, allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash during an FBI sting last year, an incident reported by MSNBC.

At a panel meeting last week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Trump brazenly instructed the attorney general to go after his perceived political enemies, including Comey, Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

“He ordered the Justice Department to go after the sitting attorney general in the state of New York, and he even ordered the entire Justice Department to go after a member of this committee,” Klobuchar said. “And if that is not chilling to my colleagues and they don’t care about this, I don’t even know what to say anymore.”

Federal prosecutors located in Maryland are looking into mortgage fraud accusations alleged by Trump allies against Schiff, according to The Washington Post. Schiff’s legal team has denied wrongdoing, and the former House member has said he is a target for his work on an impeachment of Trump and on a House select panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary panel have also criticized a federal grand jury indictment against Comey on charges he lied to Congress and obstructed a congressional proceeding. That indictment came after Trump made the post demanding that the Justice Department prosecute him.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said in the post, addressing the attorney general by her first name. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

The indictment came days after the Justice Department replaced Erik Siebert, who was leading the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia, with White House aide Lindsey Halligan. Trump took credit for pushing out Siebert.

“In my almost six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the department,” Schiff posted on social media. “The DOJ is now little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign.”

Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a floor speech that he opened an investigation calling for answers from Bondi about the Comey indictment.

“The American people deserve to know if the chief law enforcement agency of the United States is following the Constitution or pursuing political revenge,” Durbin said.

While Comey is a target today, “tomorrow it could be our fellow citizens who dare to even criticize the policies of the Trump regime,” Durbin said.

And Durbin asked for help from Republicans.

“It’s time for the Republicans to join Democrats and step up and say enough is enough,” Durbin said. “This is a code-red alarm for the rule of law, and unless we come together to stop the president’s abuses, I fear this administration will continue to corrode our American democracy.

The special agent, who works deportations in New England, told Fox News Digital that sanctuary policies banning ICE agents from using police departments or other city areas for staging often forces agents to be exposed, having to prepare for missions in public areas.

The agent explained that if ICE does not have a nearby office and is barred from using city grounds, ""that means you're stuck with, ‘Okay, I'm going to go to a supermarket. I'm going to go to some office park if I can find one, maybe a park while I don my vest and all that, and I'm getting briefed.""

On Monday, Johnson, a Democrat, signed an executive order prohibiting the use of city parking lots and garages for civil immigration enforcement staging areas, processing locations or operations bases.

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

Johnson touted the order as establishing ""ICE-free zones."" Speaking at a press conference for the signing on Monday, he said the order also enables ""unwilling private businesses"" to refuse ICE agents’ use of their property to stage for operations. He said the order is ""aimed at reining in this out-of-control administration.""

""If the federal government violates this executive order, we will take them to court,"" Johnson said, urging Trump to leave Chicago ""the freak alone.""

In a statement posted on X, Johnson accused ICE agents of ""detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents.""

""With this Executive Order, Chicago stands firm in protecting the Constitutional rights of our residents and immigrant communities and upholding our democracy,"" Johnson wrote.

CHICAGO MAYOR VOWS CITY POLICE 'WILL NOT EVER COOPERATE WITH ICE'

The White House responded by issuing a blistering statement in which it called the order ""a disgusting betrayal of every law-abiding citizen.""

The White House called the order a ""sick policy"" that ""coddles criminal illegal alien killers, rapists, and gangbangers who prey on innocent Americans.""

""Shielding the most depraved, violent criminal illegal aliens from justice is not only an insult to every Chicagoan, it’s also a dangerous intensification of Democrats’ lunatic ‘sanctuary’ agenda where criminal illegals come before American citizens,"" said the White House statement.

According to the agent, Chicago is not the only sanctuary city that bars ICE from using municipal property to stage immigration enforcement operations.

""What does that leave you with in an urban environment? You're going to go to a supermarket. Who's at a supermarket? Everyone and their grandmother,"" the agent said.

""They can see us getting together and they put it on Facebook immediately because there's different Facebook pages that we know they put us on,"" said the agent.

The agent also expressed concern over sanctuary policies keeping police departments from being able to assist if protesters get violent.

What's also not clear is why the agents were trying to detain the man.","New video circulating on social media shows what appears to be federal immigration agents confronting and attempting to detain a person in the West Lawn neighborhood on the Southwest Side of Chicago, prompting questions about why the stop happened and why the individual was let go.

Saturday morning, two men appearing to be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stopped in the middle of the street, blocking traffic near 63rd and Kostner, and approached a white car. What happened next was all caught on video.

Sam Hassan, owner of Maxcare Auto Shield, recorded cell phone video showing two men grabbing another man from behind a car and taking him to the ground

""The first thing I saw was they were pinning him against the car. Both of the guys were struggling to subdue him and try to take him to the ground,"" Hassan said.

Within seconds, the scene grows louder, with neighbors rushing out, yelling for agents to stop.

""The whole neighborhood came out to support this guy, or to stop what was going on,"" Hassan said.

At one point, the man the agents grabbed appeared to be on all fours and an agent wound up on his back. The man appeared to grab one of the agent's radios and throw it toward a bystander.

Moments later, an agent tried to zip-tie his hands, but the man tossed those away.

""I yelled, 'Let him go,' I mean, because there's certain ways and proper ways of conducting what you're doing, but you're dealing with another human being,"" Hassan said. ""Everything happened so quick, and he looked very scared.""

Hassan said a crowd gathered, shouting for the agents to stop.

The video later shows the agents suddenly release the man before they drive off. It's unclear why they let him go.

""Along the way, in trying to take him into custody they discovered they didn't have the basis to do it – somebody may have been challenging them at the scene,"" said Dr. Arthur Lurigio, a criminology professor at Loyola University.

What prompted the stop is unclear.

Surveillance footage from Hassan's shop shows a white car stopped moments before the struggle. Agents are seen speaking to the driver, then opening the back doors.

Lurigio said it appears possible the agents were not properly trained on how to detain a suspect.

""He wasn't able to subdue the man. He was putting up some resistance, and he was complaining about being grabbed on to, but the guy grabbing on to him didn't know how to get him down, and how steady him and hold him in place,"" Lurigio said.

He also pointed to another problem: one of the agents was dressed in plain clothes, not a uniform.

""He had nothing to identify who he was. Why he was there? Where he was from? That's a mystery. It should never be a mystery if a person's freedom is being taken away from them on the street,"" he said. ""They were trying to grab this man, for whatever reason, and to place him under arrest. That's taking his freedom away. We need to know who's doing that and why.""

What's also not clear is why the agents were trying to detain the man.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital.

Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday.

A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school.

Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests.

Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. In her last post at 8:52 a.m., she took a photo of a line of Illinois State Police officers, and accused the state of ""enforcing Trump’s agenda of terrorizing our community with abductions.""

She has not posted since.

A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called ""Movement Memos,"" which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop,"" she said, referring to federal immigration officials. ""I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard.""

She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals.

""There’s no center left,"" she said. ""You’re either resisting or you’re complicit.""

Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025.

""F--- the University of Chicago, it’s evil, you know it’s a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that,"" she said.

However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power.

""Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That’s possible structural leverage,"" she said.

Socialism 2025 described itself as a ""a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today.""

According to the Truthout interview, she also organizes with Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at the University of Chicago, and has referred to the war in Gaza as a ""genocide.""

""This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don’t have power… what we don’t have is power… the question I’m asking myself, and I’m asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?’"" she said at Socialism 2025.

Local police can't compete with ICE promises The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

""You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,"" the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. ""But in sanctuary cities, you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.""

The campaign - airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta - is part of ICE's $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump's Republican administration for ICE - a 10-fold increase in its current budget - as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress' failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration's top priority, is still flush with cash.

Millions spent on the 30-second ads

The ads open with video of each metro's familiar skyline and the narrator's voice announcing, for example, ""Attention, Miami law enforcement."" Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to ""join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,"" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that ""that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement ""unless legally required.""

Local police can't compete with ICE promises

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city's Police Officers Association, said he'd seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city's police department joining ICE instead.

""We can't compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,"" Diaz said. ""I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.""

The government shutdown could dampen ICE's recruitment hopes, he said.

""They're furloughing federal employees, and I don't think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don't know if they're going to receive a check or not,"" he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

""It's the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,"" said Walker, who's in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. ""That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.""

Even tourists have been drawn into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, startled by the sight of federal agents marching in camouflage last weekend through the upscale city’s Gold Coast, near the famed Magnificent Mile.

What began quietly in Chicago one month ago as a promise by the Trump administration to increase arrests of illegal immigrants is now being felt all over this city of 2.7 million people and in the broader metropolitan area encompassing millions more.

Tensions are flaring up like small, intense wildfires. At elementary schools on the West Side, parents have organized to stand guard at dismissal time. Some construction businesses are keeping their warehouse doors open to keep an eye out for ICE agents. Owners of small businesses are doing their own deliveries, to protect their Latino employees from driving through the city streets.

In Edgewater, on the Far North Side along Lake Michigan, a neighborhood listserv lit up with worries on Sunday over a helicopter circling the area. Could it be ICE, one person asked. Is there anything we can do, asked another.

Neighbors came out onto the streets of the Southwest Side on Saturday after a car crash involving federal agents and two motorists, who the Department of Homeland Security said were pursuing the agents recklessly. ICE agents responded with pepper balls and tear gas; the crowd, shouting and waving anti-ICE signs, remained until the federal agents finally left.

Restaurants have cut back hours or stopped making deliveries altogether, unwilling to risk the arrest of their employees.

“We can’t ask anyone to risk their safety just to serve bagels,” one restaurant, Bagel Miller, explained in a Facebook post explaining its closure last weekend.

Berto Aguayo, a lawyer and advocate for immigrants, described a month of rising tensions, political organizing and outright fear, as Mr. Trump’s dragnet ensnared U.S. citizens alongside illegal immigrants.

“Our family gatherings are filled with crying and trying to figure out how we get past this moment,” Mr. Aguayo said. “People are being terrorized. People are being attacked. That’s what it feels like.”

When he visits his mother’s home in Back of the Yards, a neighborhood on the Southwest Side, he said, he sees far fewer people walking around than usual. “Every single person who looks brown is scared,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/06/multimedia/06nat-chicago-scene-vhlj/06nat-chicago-scene-vhlj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 20:57:37.416915

The US supreme court has ruled for Trump in a startlingly high percentage of cases this year.
In contrast, the supreme court ruled 93.7% of the time for Trump (15 out of 16 cases), often without taking a close look at the facts.
Roberts and the conservatives are “scared out of their minds that they will have to play chicken with Trump”, Levitsky said.
“The [US] supreme court hasn’t wanted to be Churchill.” Levitsky said.","Two 0f the world’s best-known authoritarian leaders – Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president – have each had at least 15 years at their country’s helm to pack the courts with loyalists and to pressure and intimidate judges. And no surprise, judges in those countries have repeatedly done what Orbán and Erdoğan want.

Donald Trump has not had the opportunity to pack the US supreme court to nearly the same degree. Nor has he, despite his brash, bullying ways, done much to pressure or browbeat the court’s nine justices. Nevertheless, the court’s conservative supermajority has ruled time after time in favor of Trump since he returned to office. The six conservative justices have fallen into line much like Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges, even though the supreme court’s justices have life tenure to insulate them from political pressures.

With the court’s new term beginning on Monday, many Americans are dismayed that the conservative justices have been so submissive to Trump, the most authoritarian-minded president in US history. Notwithstanding the US’s celebrated system of checks and balances, the justices have utterly failed to provide the checks on Trump that many legal scholars had expected. In ruling for Trump, the chief justice, John Roberts, and the other conservatives have let him gut the Department of Education, fire Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board members, and strip temporary protected status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The rightwing supermajority has also let Trump halt $4bn in foreign aid, fire tens of thousands of federal employees despite contractual protections and deport people to countries where they have no connection.

In these and other cases, the supermajority has ceded huge power to Trump, for instance, by greatly reducing Congress’s constitutional power over spending as it let Trump unilaterally gut agencies and halt funding approved by Congress. What’s more, the court seems eager to snuff out independent, nonpartisan federal agencies by letting Trump fire agency chairs and commissioners without giving any reason, even though Congress approved laws explicitly saying those officials could only be dismissed for cause. (Pleasing corporate America, the court ordered last Wednesday that Lisa Cook can remain on the Federal Reserve Board, at least temporarily, while litigation proceeds over whether Trump can fire her as part of his effort to end the central bank’s independence.)

“The chief justice is presiding over the end of the rule of law in America,” said J Michael Luttig, a highly regarded conservative former federal appellate judge.

The conservative justices have repeatedly done Trump’s bidding even though they don’t begin to face the intense pressures that Hungary’s and Turkey’s judges face. Erdoğan has sometimes purged and blackballed judges seen as insufficiently loyal, while Orbán’s high-ranking allies have berated less obedient judges as “traitors”.

The US supreme court has ruled for Trump in a startlingly high percentage of cases this year. It has issued 24 decisions from its emergency docket (often without giving any reasons) and ruled in Trump’s favor about 90% of the time.

In doing so, the court has repeatedly vacated injunctions that lower courts had issued after concluding that Trump, with his 209 executive orders, had egregiously broken the law. Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, found that in Trump administration cases decided between 1 May and 23 June, federal district courts ruled against Trump 94.3% of the time (82 out of 87 cases), often after looking closely at the facts. In contrast, the supreme court ruled 93.7% of the time for Trump (15 out of 16 cases), often without taking a close look at the facts.

“The supreme court has pulled the rug out from under the lower federal courts, and it has done so deliberately and knowingly,” Luttig said, adding that the court is “acquiescing in and accommodating the president’s lawlessness”.

With the court siding so often with Trump, a new Gallup poll found that a record high 43% of Americans think the court is too conservative, higher than the 36% who think the court is “about right”. Moreover, the court’s overall approval rating has fallen to its lowest level since Gallup began measuring, dropping below 40% for the first time in August (before climbing slightly) – and down from nearly 60% in the early 2000s.

Steven Levitsky, a political science professor at Harvard and co-author of How Democracies Die, voiced bewilderment that the court has been so obliging toward a president who he says is a clear threat to democracy. According to Levitsky, courts come under the thumb of authoritarian governments in several ways. One way is “ideological agreement”. He said the court’s most rightwing members, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, seem in fundamental agreement with Trump, but he said the other conservatives do not love Trump even if they often rule for him. Levitsky suggested that those justices are so hostile toward liberals and liberal arguments that they gravitate towards Trump’s side in case after case.

Court packing is another way courts fall under an authoritarian’s sway. Orbán, Erdoğan and their legislative allies have appointed the overwhelming majority of their countries’ judges, while Trump has appointed three of the nine justices. With life tenure, the justices should in theory feel free from political pressure and able to rule against Trump. In the past, many justices have ruled against the presidents and parties that appointed them.

Levitsky sees another phenomenon at work: abdication. Pointing to both Congress and the supreme court, he said: “The major institutions that have the authority and responsibility to stand up and stop an authoritarian have declined to do so.”

In his view, the conservative justices may have made a major miscalculation. “They are overconfident about the strength of our institutions,” Levitsky said. “They don’t really think our democracy is in danger. They don’t think it can really happen here. I really think a majority of members of the US establishment are in that camp.”

The conservative justices have increasingly embraced the unitary executive theory, a once fringe, four-decade-old notion that the president has sole, unlimited authority over the executive branch and should, for instance, be free to fire members of independent agencies along with hundreds of thousands of federal employees. “If they really believed that Trump was a threat to democracy, they wouldn’t be giving him so much power,” Levitsky said.

The court’s conservatives, Levitsky and many legal scholars say, are also engaged in appeasement. Roberts and the conservatives are “scared out of their minds that they will have to play chicken with Trump”, Levitsky said. “The worst thing for them is if the government ignores them and they don’t have any authority. They’re just terrified that Trump will trample on them and undermine their authority. Trump is not someone you want to play chicken with. They’re terrified of a big, high-profile fight with Trump.”

In other words, the conservative justices are so eager to save face and avoid confrontation that they have often given a green light to what lower courts have seen as Trump’s lawlessness. Meanwhile, the three liberal justices – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – have written repeated, often angry dissents that chastise the supermajority for acquiescing to Trump’s lawlessness and steamrolling over parts of the constitution.

One theory is that the conservative justices are deliberately giving Trump small victories – vacating lower courts’ injunctions and letting the president’s executive orders proceed and do their damage – as the justices wait for those cases to return to the supreme court, perhaps in a year or two. At that point, those cases would be fully briefed and argued, and the court would issue formal, longer rulings. Legal scholars hope, but are not optimistic, that the thus far compliant court will be more willing to defy Trump when the cases are fully briefed and argued, with the birthright citizenship and tariff cases most often mentioned.

“What they’re doing,” Levitsky said, “is giving Trump small victories in an effort to placate him or preserve as much political capital for when the big fights come. It’s appeasement. Appeasement usually doesn’t work when you cede power to an authoritarian executive. It sends signals to society that no one is going to stop the guy. Ceding power to someone like Trump is really dangerous.”

After Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing Trump ally, was elected Brazil’s president in 2019, Alexandre de Moraes, a prominent member of Brazil’s supreme court, feared what he saw as Bolsonaro’s authoritarian tendencies. De Moraes cracked down on Bolsonaro’s efforts to spread disinformation on social media to undermine his opponents. When a mob of Bolsonaro’s allies stormed government buildings in January 2023, pushing for a coup d’etat, de Moraes led efforts to prosecute Bolsonaro. (Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison after being convicted of plotting a coup.)

“When Bolsonaro got elected, de Moraes realized that he’s a threat to democracy,” Levitsky said. “He thought that the Brazilian supreme court could be Chamberlain or Churchill.” (Neville Chamberlain, a British prime minister, agreed to let Adolf Hitler take over a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, as part of the Munich agreement, infamously declaring that the agreement would assure “peace for our time”.)

“The [US] supreme court hasn’t wanted to be Churchill.” Levitsky said. “John Roberts has been Chamberlain. I think that is incredible destructive behavior.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02c2359b2a5287f69282d9d90348a44a1613c2e/463_0_4629_3703/master/4629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b469ddf683dc32224f468ab95d26584",N,,2025-10-06 23:56:18.027241

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said tonight that she's circulating a discussion draft of a plan to reopen the government, one that would include a commitment to Democrats that Congress will address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.

The draft “suggests that there be a conversation on the ACA extension for the premium tax credits after we reopen government, but there would be a commitment to having that discussion,” she told a small group of reporters.

Collins indicated that she had the document in a folder as she walked off the Senate floor, but she would not show it to reporters.

Collins said she has circulated the draft “selectively,” and that she’s had conversations with both Republicans and Democrats. The senator said the draft would include passing the first package of three full-year appropriations bills, with a commitment to do another package of spending measures soon. Congress needs to pass 12 appropriation bills to fully fund the government.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News that bipartisan huddles forming on the Senate floor last week didn’t happen today. “It feels like we lost the momentum from last week,” she said.

Murkowski agreed with Collins’ approach that Democrats need assurance that ACA subsidies will be addressed — after Democrats deliver the votes needed to reopen the government.

“They need to know that there’s a framework here, and that’s what many of us have been talking about,” Murkowski said. “It’s like, OK, if you vote to open up the government, you know that this is kind of the way that we’re going to move to reconcile some of the things that we’ve been talking about.”

She also criticized the strategy of the Senate voting on the same two stopgap bills, calling it “Groundhog Day here.” The Senate tonight voted for the fifth time on two procedural motions: the House-passed stopgap bill and a Democratic alternative. Both votes failed.

“I think you got to have some understanding by the Democrats that are going to change their vote, that there’s a path here, and they want to know what that path is,” Murkowski said. “And so we got to be talking.”

Sen. Angus King considers opposing GOP funding measure in next vote

+2

, and

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told NBC News tonight that he is considering flipping his vote on the House-passed stopgap bill if Republicans don't address Democratic concerns about Medicaid cuts.

King, who caucuses with the Democrats and has voted in favor of passing the GOP stopgap five times, said he could flip his vote to a no “unless the Republicans are more forthcoming about dealing with the ACA problem,"" referring to the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“The best we got was last Friday when [Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.] said he was open to conversations. That’s not good enough. We need to deal with this problem,” King said.

Other senators offered mixed reactions tonight after the Senate failed to reopen the government on Day 6 of the shutdown.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who voted with the Republicans to keep the government open in March but has voted against this GOP funding bill, said she sees a “sincere effort” among Republicans to reach a deal.

“There continue to be a lot of bipartisan conversations with people, and I think those will continue,” Shaheen said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had a less optimistic view. “The Republicans won’t talk when the government is open. The Republicans won’t talk when the government is closed. This is just not working,” she said.

Asked whether he’s open to working to reach a deal on health care before the government is reopened, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said, “I think what we need to do is reopen the government right now, not deal with this temper tantrum.”

FAA reports staffing issues at airports as government shutdown continues

The Federal Aviation Administration was experiencing staffing issues or anticipating shortages at airports and other air traffic control facilities in the United States tonight.

Reports of the staffing shortfalls came hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that there has been a slight increase in sick calls since the government shutdown began.

No air traffic controllers were expected at the tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport in the Los Angeles area for an hourslong stretch today night because of staffing issues, a source familiar with the situation said.

The FAA’s website showed the staffing issue between 4 p.m. and 9:59 p.m. PT (7 pm. Monday to 12:59 a.m. Tuesday ET).

Trump participates in tele-rally for his pick in tomorrow's Tennessee special election primary

Trump joined a telephone rally tonight for Matt Van Epps, a candidate in tomorrow’s GOP primary to determine the Republican nominee for a December special election for a House seat in a deep-red Tennessee district.

Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for Van Epps on the call, boasting the candidate's résumé as a former Army helicopter pilot who's now a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard.

He also said Van Epps supported his “campaign to restore law and order to our cities and towns.” Trump recently established a task force to mobilize the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee.

“Right now, we’re in Memphis. We’re going to Chicago, where you have rampant crime, even though you have a governor that says, ‘everything is wonderful,’” Trump said of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, whose state sued the administration today to prevent the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.

Senate again rejects the House-passed GOP funding bill

and

A second vote tonight, to consider the House-passed Republican funding bill, failed in the Senate. That means the shutdown will extend into tomorrow.

The procedural motion failed 52-42. It needed 60 votes to advance. Three Democrats voted for it, and one Republican voted against it. Five senators missed the vote.

When the Senate last voted on the measure, on Friday, three senators in the Democratic caucus — Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman and Angus King — joined Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against it. Those senators voted the same way tonight.

It's the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure. The so-called clean bill would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Trump weighed in right after the Senate vote, accusing Democrats of shutting down the government while indicating willingness to negotiate with them on health care policies, which Democrats have cited as the reason they rejected the House-passed bill.

""I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Democrats have said they want issues like health care dealt with before they vote to reopen the government.

Senate rejects Democratic funding for the fifth time

and

The Senate voted down a procedural motion to move forward with a Democratic alternative to the House-passed GOP stopgap funding bill.

The measure failed along party lines, 45-50. It needed 60 votes to pass.

This is the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure.

The vote, had it succeeded, would have started consideration of a bill to fund the government through Oct. 31, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, money to offset Medicaid cuts from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and funding for lawmaker security.

Hakeem Jeffries says he hasn't 'heard a word' from the White House since last week's meeting

and

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters that neither he nor Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had “heard a word” from the White House since their Oval Office meeting last week.

He said he doesn't know of any Democrat who has spoken to Trump about reopening the government.

“Both House and Senate Democrats are clear, we’ll sit down anytime, anyplace, with anyone from your administration, including the president, to get a resolution here with respect to the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which need to be extended right now, as well as dealing with and addressing the Republican health care crisis that is devastating everyday Americans all across the country,” Jeffries said.

Utah lawmakers pass new GOP-backed congressional map

Utah lawmakers passed new congressional district lines today that seek to protect the state’s all-Republican delegation after a court ordered them to draw a new map ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Under the proposed map, Salt Lake County — the most Democratic part of Utah — would be split into two districts, rather than divided among the current four. Those two districts are expected to still lean Republican, but they could be more competitive for Democrats, while the two others in the state would remain solidly GOP.

The map, which a redistricting committee advanced this morning before the full Legislature passed it as part of special session later in the day, will still need to be signed by GOP Gov. Spence Cox and approved by the district court that demanded new lines.

The court ruled in August that the state must follow a 2018 ballot measure passed by voters, which prohibited gerrymandering; required lawmakers to keep counties, cities and communities of interest together whenever possible; and draw compact districts.

Trump says he would make a deal with Democrats 'if we made the right deal'

and

Trump suggested this afternoon that he would be open to making a deal with Democrats on a funding bill to reopen the government, without specifying under what terms or with what concessions such an agreement could be made.

“We are speaking with the Democrats, and some very good things could happen with respect to health care,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Asked whether he would be willing to make a deal with Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies, Trump responded: ""If we made the right deal, I’d make a deal.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded by discussing health care funding that Democrats have been pushing for, saying, ""Trump’s claim isn’t true — but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table.""

“If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done in healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen,"" Schumer added in a statement.

Trump says he will 'look at' Ghislaine Maxwell case after Supreme Court rejected her appeal

Trump said this afternoon that he plans to speak with the Justice Department about the Supreme Court's decision to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein who was convicted on child sex-trafficking charges in 2022.

Asked in the Oval Office whether he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump told reporters: ""I haven’t heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I’d have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.""

Asked to confirm whether he was considering such an action, Trump responded: ""I wouldn’t consider it or not consider. I don’t know anything about it.""

He also was asked why Maxwell would be considered at all as a candidate for clemency. “I don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I’d have to speak to the DOJ. I’ll look at it.”

Epstein survivors last month urged Trump to rule out a pardon for Maxwell and release documents related to Epstein’s case.

Illinois officials using Trump remarks to generals against him

and

Illinois officials and the lawsuit they filed to block the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard are pointing to Trump's remarks to the military last week to push back against his claim that he's only concerned about crime in the city.

""The federal government has been extremely clear that they’re taking this action not to assist Illinois and local officials but to use Chicago as a training ground for the military to fight what they dub the war from within,"" Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said at a news conference with Gov. JB Pritzker and other elected officials.

The suit brought by Attorney General Kwame Raoul's office refers to the remarks, as well, saying Trump told the military leaders ""they must prioritize 'defending the homeland' against the 'invasion from within' in American cities run by 'radical-left Democrats,' specifically including Chicago. He stated his intention to use our neighborhoods 'as training grounds for our military.'""

In his unusual address to the nation's military leaders last week, Trump said he'd told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military, because we’re going into Chicago very soon. That's a big city with an incompetent governor, stupid governor.”

Pritzker says Trump 'thuggery' making Chicago less safe

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he doesn't want the National Guard in his state because the Trump administration's safety efforts to date have made Chicago less safe.

""Our people have been subjected to violence, intimidation and harassment"" since Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection surged federal law enforcement into the city last month, Pritzker told reporters, accusing the government of zip-tying children and targeting people because of the color of their skin, including U.S. citizens.

""They have struck fear in our communities, including notably, fear in the hearts of U.S. citizens. Trump and the thuggery his agents have brought have actively made us less safe,"" Pritzker said.

House Oversight cancels Comey deposition on Epstein

Former FBI Director James Comey is no longer scheduled for a deposition with the House Oversight Committee as part of its Jeffrey Epstein investigation after Comey submitted a letter saying he has no relevant “knowledge and information” about the matter.

In his letter to committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., Comey writes: “At no time during my service at the Department of Justice or the FBI do I recall any information or conversations that related to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”

The letter, provided to NBC News by a spokesperson for the committee, is subject to 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which fines and/or imprisons a person who “knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up” false statements.

The committee withdrew its subpoena and canceled the deposition with Comey, which was originally planned for tomorrow. The committee did the same last week with former Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Andrew Cuomo says electing Zohran Mamdani would be a 'gift' to Trump

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on ABC’s ""The View"" this morning that electing his Democratic primary opponent for New York mayor, Zohran Mamdani, would be a ""gift"" to Trump.

""It's good for Donald Trump because it's the excuse he needs to take over New York, which he has said he will do,"" Cuomo said.

""Going into the midterms, [Trump] will take a picture of Mamdani around the country and say: 'Here’s what happened to the Democrats. They are now communists. They hate the police, they legalized prostitution, legalized drugs,'"" Cuomo warned.

The Mamdani campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cuomo framed himself instead as the ""last person"" Trump wants as mayor, saying he and Trump ""fought on a daily basis"" during the pandemic.

Trump says trucks to face 25% tariff Nov. 1

Trump said on Truth Social that medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States will be subject to a 25% tariff starting Nov. 1.

Trump had said the tariff would take effect last Wednesday, but that date came and went without the White House's releasing any executive orders to institute the levy.

Mexico, a top-three U.S. trading partner, is the largest exporter of such trucks to the United States.

Trump also planned a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports starting last Wednesday, but the White House said later that it would ""begin preparing"" the tariff on that date, rather than imposing it.

Leavitt denies Trump plans to take over cities with military

During her news briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Trump wants to take over Democratic-led cities with the military or National Guard, saying that Democratic mayors shouldn't be concerned about a long-term military or National Guard presence in their cities.

""You guys are framing this like the president wants to take over the American cities with the military,"" Leavitt said. ""The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities, and we have already seen there’s a positive formula for that.""

Leavitt pointed to the National Guard deployment in Washington as a key example of the crime-fighting effort.

""The murder rate has declined significantly,"" Leavitt said. ""Our streets are safer. People who live here feel safer — all of you in this room, I know you do, you just won’t admit it,"" Leavitt said. ""It’s a proven system that works, and the president wants to make America city safe again. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.""

White House says FBI, Treasury and the intelligence community are investigating antifa

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the briefing that the investigation into the far-left, decentralized antifa movement and the financial backing of it and associated groups is taking place across the administration.

""The FBI is working on it, alongside the White House's Homeland Security Task Force,"" she said. ""We have our intelligence community looking into this as well, and even the secretary of treasury is involved with these matters, since they are financial in nature, and we will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations in this organized anarchy against our country and our government.""

Leavitt warns that WIC, SNAP will exhaust funds 'very soon'

At the beginning of the briefing, Leavitt warned that if the Senate fails to reopen the government tonight, key federal food assistance programs for low-income households and pregnant women will run out of money.

""The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children will run out of federal money very soon,"" Leavitt said. ""It can be easily fully funded if Democrats simply vote tonight to reopen the government.""

White House says Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid shutdown

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid the ongoing government shutdown.

Asked what the president has been doing today to resolve the shutdown, she said Trump ""was on the phone with Speaker Johnson. He's also spoken with the Senate majority leader, who are in touch with, of course, moderate Democrats and Democrats across the board, who we understand, hopefully, want to do the right thing by their constituents to reopen the government.

""So the president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown on Capitol Hill,"" Leavitt said.

Trump holds phone call with Brazil's president about tariffs and the economy

Trump held a phone call with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this morning and discussed the economy, tariffs and trade.

Lula said in a post on X that he asked Trump to lower the steep 40% tariffs on his country and said that Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to negotiate further. He also expressed a willingness to travel to the United States for further talks, Brazil's government said in a statement.

Trump commented on the call in a Truth Social post, writing that ""we will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future.""

Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Brazil in part because of the legal case surrounding his political ally, and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted of an attempted coup last month and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison.

Trump’s presidential library fund is dissolved as a Florida nonprofit for apparent failure to file mandatory report

The Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc. appears to have been administratively dissolved as a Florida state nonprofit corporation last month because it failed to file an annual report with state officials.

According to records on the Florida Department of State website, the dissolution took effect Sept. 26. The fund was first established in Trump’s home state in December.

A lawyer listed as representing the library fund declined to comment. Annual reports are due by the third Friday in September in Florida.

At the federal level, Trump’s presidential library is managed by the National Archives and Records Administration, which does the same for all presidents.

Dissolved business entities are technically “prohibited by statute from engaging in any activities other than those necessary to liquidate its assets and wind up its affairs,” according to the business services firm Wolters Kluwer.

“But despite this prohibition, it is not unusual to see an administratively dissolved business entity continuing to operate as a going concern, because the people who are acting on its behalf are unaware that it has been dissolved,” the firm notes on its website.

Illinois sues the Trump administration over National Guard deployment to Chicago

and

The state of Illinois filed a lawsuit today in an attempt to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote in the filing, which names Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll as defendants.

Speaker Johnson rejects Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the shutdown

and

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rejected House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the House floor about the government shutdown.

""My friend Hakeem had his shot,"" Johnson said at a news conference this morning. ""We debated all this on the House floor."" Johnson added that Jeffries, D-N.Y., had previously spoken on the House floor for seven or eight minutes.

""He had all of his colleagues lined up. They gave it their best shot, and they argued, and they stomped their feet and screamed at us and all that,"" he continued. ""And still, we passed the bill in bipartisan fashion and sent it over to the Senate. The House has done its job.""

Jeffries proposed the idea in a letter to Johnson this morning. ""I write to challenge you to a debate on the Floor of the House of Representatives any day this week in primetime, broadcast live to the American people,"" it said.

Johnson said he spoke to the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Patty Murray, D-Wash., two days ago and told her he would agree to moving a package of spending bills on the floor once the shutdown impasse ends.

Treasury secretary and Social Security Administration chiefs to serve in dual roles at IRS

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that he would remain as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and was naming Frank Bisignano as the agency's chief executive officer

Bessent has been acting IRS commissioner since early August, while Bisignano has been the head of the Social Security Administration.

Multiple roles have become the norm in the Trump administration, with Budget Office Director Russell Vought also serving as the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also serving as national security adviser. Stephen Miran, the chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, is currently working as a Federal Reserve governor while on temporary unpaid leave from the White House.

The administration briefly discussed the idea of Bessent serving as Fed chair and Treasury Department chief at the same time, but he is now interviewing other candidates for Fed chair.

The New York City divide shaping its contentious mayoral race

New York City’s mayoral contest has fully surfaced a tension bubbling in city politics for years: the divide between lifelong New Yorkers and young professionals who have recently moved in.

In his 7-point Democratic primary win over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in June, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani cleaned up with younger voters who live in some of New York’s most gentrified neighborhoods — including Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Cuomo, meanwhile, edged out Mamdani in majority-Black, outer-borough neighborhoods that have experienced less gentrification, as well as other places like the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, also home to many longtime New Yorkers.

That divide is playing out in the general election, too, where Cuomo is running as a third-party candidate. A CBS News survey last month found that Mamdani held a 51-point edge over Cuomo among voters who have moved to New York within the last 10 years. Among voters who have lived in New York for more than 10 years, Mamdani’s advantage over Cuomo dropped to 19 points.

And among born and raised New Yorkers, Mamdani held a smaller, 7-point advantage over Cuomo. Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, two fixtures of New York politics for decades, combined to win 49% of this demographic.

Trump says federal layoffs are 'taking place right now'

and

Trump told reporters yesterday that federal employee layoffs were ""taking place right now, and it’s all because of the Democrats.""

The president did not elaborate on the extent of the layoffs. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said last week that the number of firings would likely be in the thousands.

Leavitt later clarified during an afternoon press briefing today that ""the president was referring to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed as a result of this federal government shutdown.""

Trump looms over Tennessee special election in a deep-red House district

As the special House election for a deep-red congressional district in Tennessee approaches, one issue has shaped the race above all else: Donald Trump.

A crowded field in Tuesday’s GOP primary to fill former Rep. Mark Green’s seat spent months fighting over who’s the most pro-Trump before Trump stepped in with an endorsement for Matt Van Epps at the end of last week. Other issues have fallen to the background, blurring the lines between candidates, while the increasing drumbeat of campaign ads largely revolved around support for Trump and his policies.

Trump and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn each carried the 7th District by about 20 points last year, making the Republican primary the main event in the special election to replace Green, who resigned this year.

But with campaigns expecting much lower turnout than usual because of the irregular election dates, it’s possible the Dec. 2 special general election could be a closer contest than the election was last year, like other special elections around the country this year.

The U.S. government shutdown entered its sixth day today with no end in sight after another round of blame games and sniping between leaders of the two parties on the Sunday talk shows.

Democratic and Republican leaders are locked in a standoff about the way forward as it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass a bill, and the GOP needs five more Democrats to advance its bill to reopen the government temporarily.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has called it a partisan bill written without Democratic input, demanding a negotiation to win the necessary votes from his party. But Republican leaders insist there will be no negotiation over their short-term bill.

NAACP spends to mobilize Black voters in California redistricting fight and New Jersey and Virginia governors' races

The NAACP will invest $750,000 to mobilize Black voters to cast ballots and monitor the polls ahead of key elections in three states this fall, the group exclusively told NBC News.

The group will spend a quarter-million dollars in California, where a new congressional map that would further boost Democrats is on the ballot, as well as in New Jersey and Virginia, which are hosting governors' races. The nonpartisan NAACP is not endorsing a candidate in New Jersey or Virginia.

In California, the NAACP will seek to reach 1.2 million voters and train at least 300 poll monitors in support of a mid-decade redistricting effort spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The California gerrymander comes in response to new GOP-drawn map in Texas, which the NAACP has sued over, calling it “racially motivated.”

In New Jersey, the NAACP plans to reach out to 175,000 voters in Newark, East Orange, Irvington, Trenton, Paterson, and Jersey City, as well as train at least 350 poll monitors ahead of the election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

In Virginia, the group aims to engage and educate 300,000 voters and recruit 300 poll workers amid a high-profile race for the governor's mansion between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.

The White House confirmed the deportations on Monday, saying the individuals had committed serious crimes.

Neither the US nor Eswatini confirmed the nationalities of the individuals who arrived on Monday. However, US-based immigration lawyer Tin Thanh Nguyen said they included three people from Vietnam, one from the Philippines, and one from Cambodia.

Rights groups have condemned the treatment of the first group of deportees sent to Eswatini — which included individuals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba , and Yemen — saying they were kept in solitary confinement and not given access to lawyers.

Nguyen said he was representing two of those who arrived on Monday and two others previously sent to Eswatini, but he remained unable to speak with any of them.

“I cannot call them. I cannot email them. I cannot communicate through local counsel because the Eswatini government blocks all attorney access,” he said in a statement provided to Reuters news agency.

Amid its mass deportation push, the Trump administration has increasingly relied on sending deportees to third countries when they cannot legally send them to their homeland.

Rights advocates have challenged the practice, fearing it can leave those expelled stranded in countries where they do not speak the language and may not be afforded due process.

The Trump administration has also sent “third country” deportees to South Sudan, Ghana, and Rwanda.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the latest group of deportees sent to Eswatini had been convicted of “heinous crimes”, including murder and rape.

“They do not belong in the United States,” Jackson said.

Activists in Eswatini, a small mountain kingdom bordering South Africa, have also condemned the government’s secretive deal with the US. They have launched a legal challenge in hopes of scuttling the agreement.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

Far from describing a long-running sinister plot, Justice Department attorneys acknowledged a relatively subdued protester presence in Portland since June.

Leaders in California, Illinois and Oregon are fighting to keep federal troops off their city streets, describing the battle in existential terms.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” attorneys for Illinois wrote in the opening lines of a lawsuit today against Trump’s bid to send troops to Chicago.

That dynamic crystallized Saturday in the urgent warning by a Trump-appointed federal judge, not only about an immediate effort by Trump to send troops to Portland, Oregon, but by the implications of the administration’s argument about its legal basis for doing so.

“This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law,” U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut wrote. “Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Those arguments, she said, effectively boiled down to a limitless proposition: that “the President could send military troops virtually anywhere at any time.”

Immergut’s ruling set off a furious reaction from the White House and its allies, particularly Trump aide Stephen Miller, who cast Immergut’s ruling as an “insurrection” aimed at preventing Trump from stopping an “organized terrorist attack” against federal immigration officials.

“Today’s judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen,” Miller said on X, describing the protests outside Portland ICE facilities as “a violent armed resistance designed to incapacitate the essential operations of the duly-elected federal government, by force.”

But Immergut emphasized in her ruling that the Trump administration had presented virtually no evidence of an unmanageable assault on federal property or personnel. Rather, the record showed clearly that police had managed the limited unrest, often in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, and had worked to respond when protests occasionally veered into violence.

A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Miller’s commentary, not for the first time, was at odds with the facts presented by the Trump administration itself in court. Far from describing a long-running sinister plot, Justice Department attorneys acknowledged a relatively subdued protester presence in Portland since June. Some spasms of violence — along with a general air of menace facing immigration authorities — justified Trump’s military call-up, they said.

In fact, Miller has frequently taken positions on immigration policy — often as he attacks Democratic-appointed judges — that are at odds with the facts the Justice Department presents in court.

For example, Miller accused U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan of effectively “kidnapping” Guatemalan kids that the Trump administration was trying to reunify with their parents. But the Justice Department told a different federal judge that in fact Miller’s premise was wrong: The Guatemalan government could not locate most of the parents of the kids the administration was trying to deport and that none had sought their return from the United States.

Miller has contended that the deportation of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia — despite a court order barring him from being sent to his home country — was not an accident, despite numerous acknowledgments by the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Justice Department that Abrego’s deportation was a mistake.

Chief U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo administered the oath of office. U.S. Attorney Floyd was appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi on September 16, 2025.

“Like many Northwesterners, I first experienced the beauty and outdoor opportunities in Washington while stationed at JBLM in the late 1990’s as part of the legal staff on the base,” said U.S. Attorney Floyd. “In 2009, I was able to make Western Washington my home while continuing my legal service to my country as part of the Army JAG Corps, as an attorney with the Department of Homeland Security, and later as an Immigration Judge with the Department of Justice.”

U.S. Attorney Floyd will lead an office of approximately 85 attorneys and 70 support staff. Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) enforce the criminal laws of the United States by directing investigations and prosecuting cases developed by a network of federal law enforcement agencies. The office also fills a critical role as legal counsel for the United States government in civil litigation and affirmative civil enforcement.

U.S. Attorney Floyd is deeply familiar with the work of the Justice Department. Following law school and a judicial clerkship, U.S. Attorney Floyd served in various legal roles while on active duty with the U.S. Army. In 2004, Mr. Floyd joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, and for over five years handled a wide range of federal criminal matters including violent crime, white-collar crimes, health care fraud, mail and wire fraud, bank embezzlement, child exploitation, immigration violations, and identity theft.

In 2009, U.S. Attorney Floyd and his family returned to Western Washington, and he served as Assistant Chief Counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In that role he handled detention and removal proceeding before the Immigration Court and worked closely with Federal and local law enforcement to provide training on criminal and Constitutional issues.

Even as he served his country with DHS and DOJ, Mr. Floyd continued to serve in the Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps, as a reserve officer. In November 2015 he was deployed to Iraq for six months as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. He retired from the JAG Corps in 2023 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

In 2018, Mr. Floyd was appointed to be an Immigration Judge in the Executive Office of Immigration Review, presiding over asylum, removal, and bond hearings.

Most recently, in March 2025, U.S. Attorney Floyd was called back to Washington DC to serve as Special Counsel for Immigration Enforcement in the FBI Office of General Counsel. In that role he advised the General Counsel and FBI leadership on all aspects of immigration enforcement. Mr. Floyd coordinated with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and all DOJ law enforcement components to provide guidance and training on the implementation of immigration enforcement priorities.

The ruling came Monday during a status conference held in the case of Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man deported in error to El Salvador last March and then returned back to the United States in June to face criminal charges in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said she she felt ""duty bound"" to continue the case given its importance and the fundamental questions it raises about deportation policies.

MORE: Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

The government was prohibited from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, but now seeks to deport him to another country, including possibly Uganda or Eswatini. Judge Xinis has currently banned the government from removing Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys argued that the only reason for detention after there are orders of removal is to effectuate that removal. If there are no current plans for his imminent removal, they argued, then Abrego Garcia should be released from detention. Government attorneys pointed to previous court decisions that indicate they have six months' leeway.

Judge Xinis appeared exasperated Monday with government attorneys who could not answer if there was additional evidence about removal plans to Eswatini beyond letters sent to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers.

“That’s not a tenable position. You’ve either done it or you haven’t,” she said. “It’s not a hard question, guys”

Government attorneys were unable to find anyone who could address the judge's questions about what efforts had been made to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini, citing the government shutdown as one possible reason.

The judge gave the government until Wednesday afternoon to file any evidence about steps taken to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini. She also asked the government to provide witnesses who can speak firsthand to those efforts.

""I am asking you really basic questions,"" Xinis said. ""What's been done ... have you had any conversations?""

A hearing is scheduled for Friday.

""This case is not just about one man. It is about the integrity of the U.S. Constitution,"" Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, chief of organizing and leadership at the immigration rights group CASA, said at a press conference outside the courthouse prior to the hearing. ""We need to continue to raise collective conscience as we continue to witness the inhumane retaliation by our government to a man and his family who are simply demanding due process.""

Government lawyers had requested a stay of all deadlines related to the case due to the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.

Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

""Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal Defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,"" Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in a court filing.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys had asked that the court deny the government's request, and also, in light of the government's position, to allow Abrego Garcia to be released from detention.

""The mere fact that the Government is seeking to extend all deadlines in this case indefinitely shows that there is no significant likelihood that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is no justification for continuing Petitioner's detention,"" his lawyers wrote in a reply.

Abrego Garcia is currently being detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the United States from El Salvador in June to face criminal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case released him into his brother's custody in Maryland. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials then indicated that he could potentially be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to the ICE field office in Baltimore.

Timeline: Wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador

When Abrego Garcia arrived at the office, he was immediately taken into immigration custody.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers in the Tennessee case have filed a motion to dismiss based on their claim of the prosecution being vindictive. A judge this past week determined that the ""totality of events"" creates a sufficient basis that there was a ""realistic likelihood"" that the government may have acted vindictively and entitles Abrego Garcia to discovery and a hearing on the matter before the court makes a decision on the motion.

A status conference is set for Friday in Nashville.

In a separate immigration court ruling last week, an immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his original immigration case. His lawyers had argued that his deportation and return to the U.S. had reset the clock on making an asylum claim, but the judge did not agree, closing that potential path to preventing deportation.

Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent.","Mass deportations were a central promise of Donald Trump’s campaign, with one spokesperson vowing he would “marshal every federal and state power necessary” to achieve such goals. Since taking office, this has included invoking a wartime act and deploying the National Guard to support immigration raids amid protests in Los Angeles.

Behind the scenes, these efforts rely on the use of data analytics and several technologies. From social media surveillance to facial recognition, the administration is employing a variety of legacy technological tools and databases amassed during previous presidencies. But as the administration’s deportation efforts accelerate, it seems these technologies might streamline its goals and also become more powerful with artificial intelligence (AI).

Tech capabilities in immigration enforcement

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have ushered in technologies that can help power immigration enforcement. Nearing the end of Biden’s term, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported nearly 200 uses of AI across its departments, including approximately 20 active use cases by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These range from verifying information or finding potential errors in a data set through machine learning to routine uses of facial recognition technology. For example, ICE’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which allows people without legal status to live in the U.S. during removal proceedings, rather than be put in a detention facility, requires participants to log their whereabouts through an app called SmartLINK. Usually, this involves people taking a photo of themselves and uploading it to the app, which confirms migrants’ identities through facial recognition and their location at a designated place through GPS coordinates. ICE has also deployed AI for its “Hurricane Scores,” an algorithm designed to assess the likelihood that someone will fail to check in with the agency and to inform officers’ decisions during case reviews.

Other use cases include translation services, facial recognition technologies, and “commercially procured” tools like Babel software, which assists CBP in screening social media accounts to “identify potential threats.”

Technologies have also been deployed at the border itself. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) listed about 60 uses of AI in 2024, including autonomous surveillance towers that can detect and predict migration activity. DHS has also tested robodogs, which would be deployed at the southern border.

The expansion under Trump

These technologies adopted from previous administrations could be repurposed by the Trump administration, including in applications that extend beyond a technology’s original planned use case. Some planned use cases include drug smuggling, human trafficking, and transnational gang activity. The chief operating officer of Geo Group, a private prison firm that sells tracking technology to ICE, confirmed the Trump administration’s intention to monitor millions of individuals in removal proceedings, stating that the company has “assured ICE of our capability to rapidly scale up.”

The administration has already adapted several technology use cases to support its mass deportation efforts, including rebranding the “CBP One” app—which had granted immigration parole to nearly one million people since January 2023. In March, it was relaunched as “CBP Home” to encourage individuals to self-deport.

The administration has also adapted its methods of social media surveillance. Though agencies like the State Department have gathered millions of handles and monitored political discussions online, the Trump administration has been more explicit in who it’s targeting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new, zero-tolerance “Catch and Revoke” strategy, which uses AI to monitor the public speech of foreign nationals and revoke visas of those who “abuse [the country’s] hospitality.” In a March press conference, Rubio remarked that at least 300 visas, primarily student and visitor visas, had been revoked on the grounds that visitors are engaging in activity contrary to national interest. A State Department cable also announced a new requirement for student visa applicants to set their social media accounts to public—reflecting stricter vetting practices aimed at identifying individuals who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles,” among other criteria.

The Brennan Center for Justice reports that these plans could expand existing programs to collect social media handles from an additional 33 million people. The administration has already begun advancing such proposals—for instance, Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued a notice proposing the collection of social media identifiers through immigration forms. The State Department also intends to use these tools not only to identify potential legal violations but to screen for “antisemitic activity” or terrorist sympathies, without clearly defining those terms. This represents just one facet of the data the administration plans to use in its immigration crackdown.

Merging data sets

Although vast amounts of data on both U.S. citizens and noncitizens are already held across federal agencies, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to centralize some of this information into a shared repository, following an executive order from Trump calling for the elimination of “information silos.” According to Wired, DOGE intends to integrate data from agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into USCIS’s “data lake,” which contains information on immigration cases. Additional reports indicate that DOGE and ICE have also requested access to Medicare data to obtain immigrants’ addresses, despite nonresidents being ineligible for the program.

Successive administrations have worked closely with Palantir, a data analytics and technology firm with federal contracts dating back to 2010, to expand the government’s technological capacity for immigration enforcement. Since Trump took office, Palantir has received more than $113 million in federal funds, including $30 million in May to build “ImmigrationOS,” a database system designed to support “selection and apprehension operations” aligned with enforcement priorities, provide “real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation,” and manage logistics across the immigration process. The system is expected to prioritize violent criminals, gang members, and individuals who have overstayed their visas.

The risk of abuses

Criticism of the technologies used by the government to target immigrants has been well documented for years. A key concern with facial recognition, for example, is that it can exacerbate racial disparities in policing and increase the likelihood of misidentifying people of color, largely due to nonrepresentative training data. Some states, such as Illinois, have protections against the collection or use of biometric information through laws like Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, but no comparable protections exist at the federal level. The Trump administration also replaced Biden-era guidance on the use of AI in federal agencies with its own framework, largely maintaining continuity while consolidating “rights”- and “safety”-impacting AI into a single “high-impact” category. Civil liberties advocates argue that this designation is too narrow, excluding processes that still require human oversight despite the risks of “automation bias.”

AI can misclassify individuals’ criminal records, score people based on incomplete information, and introduce other forms of bias in law enforcement. Even without AI, the sheer expansion of data collection by DOGE and federal immigration agencies has significant implications. Privacy advocates warn that programs designed to facilitate the deportation of noncitizens may also affect U.S. citizens, since agencies must gather data on everyone to determine legal status. Facial recognition technologies used by federal law enforcement—including ClearView AI systems that collect and sell publicly available images—have already faced legal challenges in the U.S., France, and the Netherlands. Americans have limited privacy protections, as the country lacks comprehensive federal privacy legislation, and protections are weaker for noncitizens.

Furthermore, while everyone in the U.S. is theoretically entitled to First Amendment protections, noncitizen have been targeted in immigration proceedings for their speech and activism. Because AI may struggle to interpret nuance or context, using online speech as a basis for removal proceedings could have chilling effects on free expression and public discourse nationwide. Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent. Individuals may self-censor, fearing repercussions for peaceful forms of government criticism, such as writing op-eds or participating in campus protests. Some universities have even advised international students to be cautious about their digital footprints.

The prior administration worked to establish voluntary guidance and nonbinding guardrails to promote the responsible and ethical design and deployment of these technologies in government. In the absence of stronger regulations and a national data privacy standard, however, the current administration has created a “wild west” regarding the repurposing and procurement of surveillance tools that support its immigration agenda.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2017-01-25T000000Z_1068917720_RC157D3D0FD0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MEXICO-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:46.852624

“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention.","As state legislators inside the Capitol in Hartford discussed the possibility of a special session on Monday, faith leaders and immigrant advocates rallied outside the building, urging the lawmakers to prioritize immigrant safety.

The large crowd had marched from the federal courthouse to the Capitol for their rally, with signs that read “Hands Off Our Neighbors” and “Gov. Lamont: Immigrant Protections Can’t Wait” and chanting “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!”

In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, often wearing masks, have detained people across Connecticut, at federal courthouses, carwashes, and from their vehicles.

Many of the speakers at Monday’s rally were faith leaders in Connecticut. Reverend Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester, said that he, along with many advocates at the rally, had worked hard to put protections for immigrants into an updated version of the TRUST Act when lawmakers were in session earlier this year.

“It was infuriating when the bill that we wanted got out of the Judiciary Committee and then just got watered down. And so many of the good things that were in that bill — the things that immigrants needed to be safe in our state — went away in that strange way that laws get made in Connecticut,” Pawelek said.

Pawelek urged those gathered to scan a QR code distributed on flyers through the crowd that would link them to a page to write to lawmakers.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, also spoke at the rally. In his district, an August raid by masked ICE agents took place at a Newington car wash. Lesser said the state has the ability to better protect immigrants, but, “we need strong laws that apply equally to anyone who is depriving the civil rights of anyone in this state. Connecticut can play an important role, but we have a choice to make. And I’m hoping we do so soon.”

After the rally ended, Lesser said there are two schools of thought among lawmakers inside the Capitol: “One that Connecticut should take a more confrontational approach, and one that we should keep our heads down.” While Lesser said he understands why some lawmakers favor a more passive approach, “I just don’t think that’s going to work, I don’t think that’s how you stop a bully.”

Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, also spoke at Monday’s rally. She updated the crowd on the case of Victor Sanchez, an activist with Make the Road and HDD, who was detained in September when he arrived to federal court for a routine check-in.

“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention. But that news was tempered by the stipulation that Sanchez was given just 30 days to leave the country.

Segovia said her group planned to keep fighting for Sanchez to be able to stay in the U.S. She also read some words in both Spanish and English from Sanchez, who said he was blessed to be a member of the community.

“When I was in detention, I talked to people who didn’t have anything — no documents, prepared in packets, no communities or organizations rallying in support. The reason I am here today is because of all of my community support and the organizing of my community. That people united will never be defeated.”

Segovia told those gathered that lawmakers should act on several concerns the immigrant community has: “We need to protect our personal information from the federal government. Am I right? We need to protect our communities and make sure that our tax dollars are not being spent to assist immigration enforcement in Connecticut.”

Segovia also said that funding should be directed so that no one, regardless of immigration status, loses Medicaid coverage or access to food assistance programs.

Judiciary Committee Co-chair Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said in an interview that lawmakers would continue to look for ways to support immigrants in Connecticut, if given the opportunity during a special session, which must be called by Gov. Ned Lamont. “We’ll continue to try and do what we can to make sure people feel safe in our state, despite the threatening and frankly harassment coming from the federal government,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4934-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:50.889695

“Sarkisov’s failure to satisfy these two ‘most critical’ stay factors—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—dooms his motion.","Listen to this article

Where a petitioner has moved to stay an immigration judge’s deportation order, that motion should be denied because the petitioner has shown neither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm.

“An immigration judge issued a final order holding that Arsen Sarkisov, an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, is subject to deportation. Over six years later, Sarkisov moved to reopen his case, but the immigration judge denied that motion. Sarkisov appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which rejected his claim. In 2023, Sarkisov appealed the Board’s decision to our court. At the same time, he asked our court to stay the immigration judge’s deportation order for the duration of the appeal. The United States did not oppose this request for a stay. The case was then paused for almost a year while Sarkisov sought to negotiate a resolution with the government. But the litigation resumed when those efforts failed. Sarkisov’s motion for a stay is now before us.

“The traditional test for a stay governs an alien’s request for a stay of removal pending appeal. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009).

“To satisfy that burden, the applicant must show, among other factors, (1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his underlying appeal and (2) that he will be irreparably injured without a stay. … But these two factors ‘are the most critical.’

“Here, Sarkisov hasn’t met his burden. His two-page motion doesn’t show that he is entitled to a stay under Nken.

“Start with the first factor, likelihood of success on the merits. Far from persuading us that he is likely to succeed, Sarkisov’s stay motion doesn’t say anything at all about the merits. So he can’t establish this factor.

“Second, Sarkisov hasn’t offered a single reason why he would suffer irreparable harm without a stay. He offers only the conclusory assertion that ‘I will suffer irreparable harm if I am removed.’ … But removal from the United States ‘is not categorically irreparable.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. When Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, it repealed a prior statute that prevented aliens who leave the United States from continuing to seek review of their removal orders. … Since litigants like Sarkisov are now free to continue pursuing their appeals from abroad if they are deported while the appeal is pending, ‘the burden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.’ … Thus, without any additional arguments showing why his removal during appeal would cause him irreparable harm, Sarkisov can’t satisfy this factor.

“Sarkisov’s failure to satisfy these two ‘most critical’ stay factors—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—dooms his motion. … In any event, Sarkisov has also failed to establish that his removal pending appeal would harm the public interest. ‘There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 436. ‘The continued presence’ in the United States of an alien lawfully determined to be removable ‘permits and prolongs a continuing violation of United States law.’ … Sarkisov hasn’t argued that his case is different.

“To be sure, the government has not opposed Sarkisov’s motion for a stay. But that doesn’t mean that Sarkisov is entitled to relief.

“First, the government’s non-opposition can’t relieve Sarkisov of his burden to satisfy the Nken test.

“What’s more, the government may not effectively compel a court to enter equitable relief by failing to oppose a motion that seeks such relief. A stay pending appeal is an extraordinary remedy that lies within the discretion of the court. Equitable remedies such as stays are ‘never awarded as of right.’ Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Thus, a court must decide for itself whether this remedy is warranted, even though the government does not oppose its issuance.

“Accordingly, the motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2025-10-06 20:57:50.796169

Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity to end the state’s policy of denying worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while working.

In a press conference held in advance of oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court, which will begin on Wednesday, Anna Hill Galendez, a managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the issues in this case involve basic fairness and worker well-being.

“The reality is, many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more cutting corners on health and safety protections and when workers are inevitably injured, workers compensation insurance companies know they can deny wage loss benefits without challenge,” Galendez said.

John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, noted that this issue has already been addressed in Ohio and Minnesota, where in both states undocumented workers have been guaranteed access to worker’s compensation. The Sugar Law Center is representing the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center alongside FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization focused on issues of corporate agriculture.

“Going to work should not mean having to gamble your health, your livelihood or the ability to care for your family,” Galendez added.

However, this case, first filed in 2021 in the Court of Claims, has become about more than just immigrant rights, argued lawyer David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. The Court of Appeals, overturning a decision from the Court of Claims, ruled in May 2024 that the argument was not timely — thus making Whitmer subject to immunity — because the claim was filed more than one year after the governor’s policy went into effect.

“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” Muraskin said.

Phil Mayor, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, which has filed an amicus brief in the case, shared a similar portrayal of the issue.

“It’s an issue about whether Michiganders, and I mean all Michiganders, can go to court to stop the government from breaking the law, or whether, as the governor would have it, if they’ve gotten away with breaking the law for a year, they can just keep doing it indefinitely,” Mayor said.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and its lawyers are aiming to have this case sent back to the Court of Claims by the Supreme Court. Muraskin also noted, however, “she [Gov. Whitmer] could tomorrow choose to stop enforcing this policy and follow the law, and that would resolve this case entirely.”

The flight with the 10 migrants from various locations originated in Louisiana and reached Eswatini earlier Monday, after stops in Puerto Rico, Senegal and Angola, the AP reported, citing officials on the ground and a lawyer for two of the deportees.

The five men deported earlier this year — from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos and Yemen — had various criminal backgrounds and convictions, according to a post from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson at the time.

The Trump administration also recently notified the team of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accidentally deported to El Salvador earlier this year, that immigration authorities were seeking to deport him to Eswatini, according to a DHS spokesperson.

Eswatini is a small kingdom of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa where King Mswati III has ruled with absolute power for almost 40 years. Human Rights Watch says it has reviewed documents that show the U.S. will pay Eswatini $5.1 million as part of a deal to take up to 160 deportees.

In his first months back in office, President Trump’s administration has talked with various countries about taking U.S. deportees, with the administration saying last week it would offer to pay migrant children for self-deportation.

The administration has also enacted an aggressive effort to identify, arrest and deport migrants without legal status in cities across the country, spurring protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices.

The Trump administration, in turn, has moved to deploy National Guard troops to some cities, which it says is necessary to protect ICE agents and buildings.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called these protests “domestic terrorism” in a Sunday post on the social platform X.

When reached for comment on the Eswatini deportations, DHS pointed The Hill to the White House.

“The illegal aliens deported to Eswatini have been convicted of heinous crimes which include murder and rape – they do not belong in the United States,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to The Hill on Monday.

“The Trump Administration is fulfilling the President’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens using all the tools at our disposal.”

JB Pritzker called an “invasion.”

Trump pushed forward with the plan to activate hundreds of National Guard soldiers, including some from Texas, despite monthslong opposition from state and local leaders, as well as objections from civic and business groups in the city.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” Pritzker said in a statement Sunday night. “It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to Illinois to protect federal immigration officers and facilities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview, a near-west suburb of Chicago, has been the site of several clashes between ICE agents and demonstrators in recent weeks.

But Pritzker, who said Saturday that he refused the Trump administration’s “ultimatum” to activate the National Guard himself, has insisted there is no emergency necessitating guardsmen on the ground. He also warned that White House officials would use any conflict between immigration agents and civilians as a “pretext” for military occupation.

“It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police,” the lawsuit said.

The suit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, names Trump, Noem and Hegseth as defendants.

Texas National Guard also activated

Illinois filed its lawsuit hours after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced he will send 400 guardsmen to cities around the country, including Chicago, and after a federal judge in Oregon blocked National Guard deployments to Portland.

The order is “effective immediately for an initial period of 60 days” and subject to extension, according to the memo, signed by Hegseth. It comes a day after Pritzker confirmed Trump’s intention to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the lawsuit reads. “To guard against this, foundational principles of American law limit the president’s authority to involve the military in domestic affairs. Those bedrock principles are in peril.”

The promised deployment comes as ICE has ramped up activity in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings since the clashes began. On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a “manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants who have criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens and children with zip ties. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The lawsuit also alleges ICE activity in Chicago and its suburbs has already subjected Illinois “to serious and irreparable harm.”

“It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois’s tax revenue,” the complaint said.

That argument echoes one made by a group of Chicago business and civic groups over the weekend.

“National Guard troops on our streets, like those reportedly being ordered here by the federal government, have the potential to sow fear and chaos, threatening our businesses’ bottom lines and our reputation,” the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Civic Federation said in a joint statement Saturday.

Read the lawsuit here.

Order violates states’ rights

Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the troop deployment violates Illinois’ rights as sovereign state to carry about its own law enforcement, as well as 1878 Posee Comitatus Act that bans the military from participating in domestic law enforcement.

The lawsuit also claims the Trump administration failed to meet any criteria that could allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The president can federalize the National Guard to stop a foreign invasion, when the president can’t execute the laws of the country or to stop a rebellion.

Raoul and state leaders have argued for weeks that Trump would use protests in Broadview as a “flimsy pretext” to claim a rebellion.

Several protestors have been arrested near the facility in recent weeks on charges of assaulting officers. Federal agents have sprayed tear gas and fired nonlethal ammunition into crowds that have gathered there.

Over the weekend, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman on the city’s Southwest Side in a confrontation with protesters. Prosecutors eventually charged the woman and another protestor with attempting to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.” According to the Chicago Sun-Times, agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment before she was charged.

Further, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration has entirely manufactured any public safety crisis in Illinois that would require military intervention. It cites a 2013 social media post by Trump, two years before he announced his candidacy for president, that suggested the military should be deployed to Chicago. It lists several other derogatory comments Trump made about the city, state and their leaders over the years, including as president.

The lawsuit argues that animosity culminated last week with Trump claiming during a speech to military generals that there was an “invasion from within” and suggesting cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds” for the military.

How soldiers will be deployed

The lawsuit includes new details about how federal officials communicated with state leaders and gave Pritzker an ultimatum.

DHS sent a memo to the Illinois National Guard on Sept. 28 stating troops “would integrate with federal law enforcement operations, serving in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control.”

On Saturday morning, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Rodney Boyd received a formal email from the Defense Department National Guard Bureau saying Trump asked for at least 300 soldiers, and if Boyd did not activate them within two hours, Hegseth would federalize them. Boyd responded that Pritzker declined to activate the guard. Defense officials sent a new memo late Saturday saying the guard was federalized.

Illinois National Guard leaders received another memo on Sunday informing them soldiers from Texas would be sent to Chicago beginning Monday.

Abbott, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been a frequent foil of Pritzker, bussing thousands of asylum-seeking migrants from the border to Chicago in 2023 and 2024 and criticizing the Illinois governor for welcoming Texas Democratic legislators who fled their state this summer amid a partisan redistricting fight. He said in a social media post that Pritzker “can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it.”

Prior to this year, the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without a request from a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama without the cooperation of segregationist Gov. George Wallace.

In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.","The Trump administration is considering admitting far fewer refugees into the U.S. this year — as few as 7,500, and mostly white South Africans, officials say — a dramatic new low as the administration is conducting sweeping immigration raids as part of its mass deportation agenda.

The new figures have not been finalized by the Trump administration or officially transmitted in a notification to Congress as required by last week’s deadline, according to two people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss it with the media.

The decreased numbers of refugees would be a stark departure from the higher figures traditionally allowed into the U.S. — the Biden administration last year set a target of 125,000 refugee admissions.

And advocates warn it would essentially bump from the line those who have already been vetted and are awaiting approvals. It all comes as the Department of Homeland Security is engaged in a crackdown on immigrants in American cities, including this past weekend in Chicago,and recruiting officers with a social media campaign to “recapture our national identity.”

“This would be a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy, not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive officer of resettlement organization Global Refuge.

“Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group,” Vignarajah said.

Trump suspended the refugee program in January

The refugee program — which once had widespread bipartisan support — was suspended on Trump’s first day in office.

Since then only a trickle of refugees have been admitted to the country, either as part of an ongoing court case seeking to resume the program or as part of a new refugee program for Afrikaners that Trump announced in February. The administration says the white South African farmers face discrimination and violence at home, which the country’s government strongly denies.

The White House said the refugee cap is not final until the administration consults with Congress, according to an official granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The official and one of the other people said due to the federal government shutdown, no refugees will be admitted during the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, until the government is reopened, although with the program suspended, few are being let in as is.

Some 128,000 refugees have currently been approved for resettlement in the United States and are now stuck in limbo, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency. In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.

“How can a president who claims to stand for religious and American values and who claims to support legal and orderly migration turn his back on so many refugees who followed the rules, while moving white South Africans to the front of the line?” he said.

The expected admissions are lower than advocates hoped

The 7,500 number is a dramatic reduction in the already historically low refugee admission caps that Trump put forward during his first term and also well below what refugee advocates had feared would be the target for the coming fiscal year.

In early- to mid-September, organizations that assist refugees began sounding the alarm that the administration was considering a cap of roughly 30,000, with most of those spots reserved for white South Africans.

Administration officials said at the time that the numbers were in flux and would require White House sign off, but gave no indication that the total number could be slashed by more than 20,000 from what the advocates had feared.

As the government shutdown loomed last week, these officials began to say that no final determination would be made until Congress had been consulted and that that was unlikely until after the shutdown ended.

One senior U.S. official said Saturday such consultation is still required and would not likely occur until the government goes back to work.

But the official also noted that 7,500 admissions in the current fiscal year would be “significantly more” than had been allowed in since Trump took office for the second time in January.

Other refugees may be left in limbo

Certain lawmakers in Congress have been pressing the White House for the official notification, which was required by law by the Sept. 30 deadline.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters said the Trump administration is “in open defiance of the law.”

Refugees are being left in “limbo,” wrote Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels in a letter last week. “The consequences are dire.”

They said thousands of people are facing persecution abroad “who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements” are being left to languish in refugee while Trump is “carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/border-migrants-15.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:57:55.142892

“What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?” This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed.","An Indigenous nation of fewer than 1,000 people in South Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe doesn’t often get involved in local politics. But then private contractors showed up to an abandoned airport and started erecting a detention center in the middle of the Everglades. The Miccosukee leapt into action, realizing that the behemoth structure would drastically change the fragile wetlands that they call home.

It didn’t take long for the so-called Alligator Alcatraz to also develop a reputation for egregious human rights abuses. Billed as an immigration detention center for the “most dangerous criminals,” reports started quickly circulating that detainees were experiencing medical neglect and didn’t have access to basic hygiene. More than thirty men were detained in a single cage, with only three toilets to share. Immigration lawyers reported that they could not communicate with their clients, with some detainees even disappearing within the system.

“We found out that Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity were putting together a lawsuit,” says Curtis Esteban Osceola, an attorney and senior policy adviser to the chair of the Miccosukee Tribe. The tribe joined this environmentally focused suit a few weeks later.

While the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had organized a lawsuit that outlined civil rights abuses at Alligator Alcatraz, the environmental lawsuit focused on the ecological impact of the detention center. The groups pointed out that the private contractors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hired to build the facility had started construction without the necessary environmental reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and could jeopardize already endangered species. When the Miccosukee Tribe joined, they added that the barbed wire fences around the facility cut them off from ancient burial grounds, and that the construction had gone ahead without consultation with tribal leaders.

Faced with this evidence, U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams issued a temporary restraining order and then a ruling, which halted construction on the facility, including an immediate shutdown of the sewage and waste management system, which was deemed unfit for use.

“It effectively shuts the facility down because without sewage management and waste receptacles, the facility can’t operate,” Osceola explains.

Since then, Alligator Alcatraz has been steadily dismantled, marking a major blow to one of the Trump Administration’s most hostile experiments in immigration detention. However, Trump’s assault on immigrant communities has continued with an unprecedented number of ICE raids sweeping cities across the nation, forcing families to stay home out of fear of being picked up and becoming a part of the record number of 61,226 people currently in immigration detention across the country.

“People aren’t going to doctors’ appointments,” says Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “When immigration raids happen, they aren’t sending their kids to school.”

Already, communities like the heavily immigrant-populated Boyle Heights in Los Angeles are experiencing the economic fallout of Trump’s raids as shoppers stay home and street vendors and other local businesses lose customers. Even the Las Vegas Strip has experienced a downturn as hospitality workers stay home, citing fears of similar raids.

If Alligator Alcatraz is any indication, local communities and interest groups can come together to challenge Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, bringing together environmental, economic, and local interests to chip away at his deportation machine.

“Local advocates have spent a lot of time preparing for the second Trump Administration, even before he took office,” Bush-Joseph says. In some cases, she explains, this means understanding decision-making hierarchies in local politics and forging relationships with key decision-makers, such as sheriffs and local politicians.

One of the ways that this federal crackdown is being carried out on a local level is through 287(g) agreements, which enable ICE to train and deputize local police forces to carry out immigration enforcement. While these agreements have technically been around since the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has capitalized on them as a means to supercharge immigration enforcement, pressuring jurisdictions across the country to enter into them. Under Trump, the number of these agreements has ballooned from just 135 at the beginning of 2025 to almost 900 by mid-August, with states like Florida and Texas leading the nation in approving such partnerships.

“In the past, these agreements have meant that there are fewer resources for local public safety efforts and that communities will be afraid of reporting crimes to the police,” Bush-Joseph says, citing a 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute that found these agreements had no impact on crime statistics. Conversely, they might hinder local law enforcement’s ability to fight crime.

“Opportunity costs might be one of the most important,” Bush-Joseph continues, explaining that along with eroding trust with immigrant communities, a lot of time will be spent on immigration enforcement when it could be spent on other law enforcement needs.

While there are three kinds of 287(g) agreements, the most prominent is the Task Force Model, which enables local police officers to inquire about someone’s immigration status and call ICE during routine enforcement duties.

Since the passage of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July—which earmarks more than $170 billion for immigration and border control—and the DHS announcement in August of generous signing bonuses for new ICE recruits, a number of sheriffs have spoken out against these agreements, accusing immigration enforcement of betraying partnerships and now poaching their best officers.

Given that these agreements are made on a local level, community members are able to push back at town hall meetings and with local decision-makers—including sheriffs and city council members. While the Trump Administration has made an aggressive push for counties to adopt these agreements, some communities have successfully stopped them from going forward. In Maine, the town of Wells paused its agreement with ICE while the state considers legislation to ban these kinds of contracts. Camden’s police department in Delaware rescinded its agreement with ICE after backlash from residents. Even in Florida’s Key West, residents were able to suspend the program, although it was recently reinstated following pressure from the state attorney general.

“There are so many resources being poured into immigration that we have to ask about inertia,” Bush-Joseph says. “What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?”

This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed. When Alligator Alcatraz became a legal target, Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis turned his attention to another shuttered facility with plans to reopen as an immigrant detention center outside of Jacksonville, a former state prison now dubbed “Deportation Depot.” An Indiana state complex near the venue for the Indianapolis 500 has been nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer” as it prepares to allocate one-third of its beds to immigrant detainees. A similar facility in Nebraska has been named the “Cornhusker Clink.” Most recently, the Trump Administration opened a tent camp for immigrant detainees at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, which Trump hopes will someday be the largest immigration detention center in the country.

Some cities—such as Elizabeth, New Jersey—have successfully resisted ICE building prisons in their neighborhoods.

“You have to organize with people,” says Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, who helped mobilize a local push to keep Elizabeth’s Union County Jail from contracting with ICE and other private prisons.

“It’s not like county officials came to us and told us that they were thinking about [contracting with ICE],” she laughs. “We found out because we have a strong base that feels confident in our leadership and shared what they heard swirling around the city.”

By the time Morsy and her team were able to confirm the rumors, the vote to put up a bid for the jail was happening within the next ninety-six hours. Still, the community was able to organize a mass mobilization of more than 200 people that turned out to protest the vote, with thirty people offering testimony at the meeting.

Even then, the vote passed, which allowed the county to advance to the next stage and put the jail up for auction. Instead of backing down, Morsy and her team continued mobilizing to keep the pressure on by organizing meetings and op-eds in the local newspapers, coupled with calls to the county commissioner’s office. “We had an election coming up, so we wanted to make a connection about how important the jail was to the voters,” she says, explaining that the jail is right in the middle of Elizabeth’s downtown. “We also wrote up a legal memo to explain to the county how it was totally feasible for them to edit their bid so that ICE or a federal prison could not be considered.”

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the ongoing abuses of detainees being documented at Delaney Hall, another federal immigration detention facility in nearby Newark. During a Congressional visit to Delaney Hall in May, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing. While the charges were eventually dropped, the arrest showed just how brazen ICE could be.

“We leveraged this moment to draw attention to the fact that there are no rules or regulations when it comes to working with ICE,” Morsy explains. The outrage generated support for the mayor and solidarity across the city.

Many local officials started to testify alongside other community members at the monthly meetings, and the tide started to turn. By the time of the next vote, there was broad support for refusing to contract with ICE or any other private prison.

For anyone trying to organize against ICE building or repurposing an existing prison as an immigration detention center, Morsy recommends becoming very clear about the objective.

“Our goal is not just to shut down the Union County Jail or shut down detentions,” she explains. “Our goal is to make it untenable for ICE detentions and ICE jails and ICE camps to operate here.”

That requires understanding the various ways different community members can participate.

“Everybody has a role to play, right?” she says. Some of the more affluent members of the community, for example, have personal relationships with the commissioner.

“For the working class, we have to recognize the power of our testimonies and think about the ways that local communities are impacted by these decisions,” she continues. “We need to get these people in a room with elected officials.”

If there is a structure being built, “you have to look at the land that you’re on,” Osceola suggests, explaining that depending on where you are, there might be different state, federal, or environmental laws that can help make the case. In the case of Alligator Alcatraz, contractors started constructing fences without permits in a fragile ecosystem with no review of the environmental impact.

“Everything was on the record,” he says, noting that these violations were what ultimately swayed the judge in their favor. “The state didn’t do anything. The feds didn’t do anything. They just decided that they were going to build a detention center in the middle of this fragile ecosystem.”

Meanwhile, Morsy recommends keeping an eye on buildings that could be repurposed.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.
Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction.
The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.
“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March.","Violating court orders, gutting anti-corruption efforts, imperiling national security and weaponizing law enforcement against the president’s perceived enemies. These are the ways in which Donald Trump and his appointees are destroying the Justice Department, say scores of career employees who were recently pushed out of the DOJ under the president’s second term.

“We believe it’s our duty to sound the alarm about this administration’s degradation of DoJ’s vital work, and its assault on the public servants who do it,” according to an open letter signed by 282 former officials, obtained exclusively by MSNBC.

The collective letter, which was signed by a cross section of former prosecutors, FBI agents, intelligence analysts, immigration judges, civil rights attorneys and others, represents an extraordinary effort by civil servants to publicly call out what they see as Trump’s brazen disregard for constitutional norms and avowed threats of judicial vengeance against those who have crossed him.

All were nonpartisan career officials, not political appointees. Some were fired because they investigated Trump or those who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, violence at the Capitol, while others quietly resigned.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.

“We call on all Americans — whose safety, prosperity, and rights depend on a strong DOJ – to speak out against its destruction,” they wrote.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974. The Watergate scandal touched the Justice Department, but the recently departed bureaucrats allege Trump has mounted a much broader and more sustained assault on its independence, policies and personnel.

“This administration’s lies about the ‘deep state’ and exaggerations about government inefficiency have eroded the respect our country once held for public servants,” the letter says. “Demonizing, firing, demoting, involuntarily transferring, and directing employees to violate their ethical duties has already caused an exodus of over 5,000 of us — draining the Department of priceless institutional knowledge and expertise, and impairing its historical success in recruiting top talent.”

The former officials, echoing sentiments expressed privately to MSNBC by other former and current Trump administration officials who have not been willing to go public, added, “We may feel the effects of this for generations.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction. His move to fire FBI Director James Comey and pressure the attorneys general in his first administration became part of a special counsel investigation into whether he obstructed justice, though former special counsel Robert Mueller did not reach a conclusion.

Yet, during Trump’s first term, much of the DOJ ran as it always had. Many of the letter’s signatories worked in the department during that time, and most career officials have said they were free to do their jobs as they saw fit.

The second Trump term has been strikingly different. The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.

“For decades, the guiding tenet for those working at the department was to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer and founder of the advocacy group Justice Connection. “Many believe that’s no longer possible. They’re being asked to put loyalty to the President over the Constitution, the rule of law, and their professional ethical obligations.”

The letter will be posted later Monday on the website of Justice Connection.

The president and his supporters say they are merely fulfilling his campaign promises and correcting a historic wrong by shutting down what they call partisan lawfare. The best evidence of that, they say, are two federal felony cases against Trump brought by former special counsel Jack Smith with the help of career FBI agents and prosecutors.

But eight months into his second term — with access to all the texts, emails and phone records preserved from the previous administration — they have yet to produce proof that Biden political appointees influenced those investigations.

“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March. “So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.”

The letter says he has done the opposite. It notes that the Justice Department’s basic mission is “to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights.”

Now, the former officials say, “It’s failing on all three fronts.” They point to what they see as the president’s retaliatory prosecutions of Comey, Smith and others; and accuse the Trump Justice Department of violating court orders, evading due process requirements, directing attorneys to eschew their ethical responsibilities and firing employees without notice or cause.

The letter also says Trump and his attorney general, Pam Bondi, have ousted FBI employees, prosecutors, national security experts and shifted highly trained personnel away from counterintelligence and counterterrorism.

The department also has purged attorneys who enforce environmental laws, driven out 75% of attorneys from the Civil Rights Division; and gutted the teams of prosecutors and FBI agents who investigate public corruption, paving the way for government graft, the letter notes.

“The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other longstanding work the Department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,” the letter adds. “Its plans to eliminate the Tax Division, which saves the country billions of dollars by pursuing tax evaders, will leave us poorer. Cancelling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants has left at-risk communities less protected and crime victims less supported.

All of this, the signers say, is “catastrophic for the nation.”

“We call on Congress to exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,” the letter says. “Members in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle must provide a meaningful check on the abuses we’re witnessing.”

“Our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can’t survive without the principal institution that enforces it.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-pam-bondi-ac-730p-61c925.jpg",N,,2025-10-06 19:57:19.423170

An anonymous DHS official told the news outlet that government lawyers were instructed to put all bond rulings on hold — though DHS publicly denied that claim.
In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.
“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads.
Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge.","Inside the living quarters at the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville, Ahmed felt his mental health begin to unravel.

There was little to do and nowhere to be alone. He shared one open room with dozens of other men. They slept in rows of bunks in one half of the room and ate at dining tables that butted up against a row of fully exposed toilets in the other — close enough that the sight and smell of them were part of every meal.

Outdoor recreation was rare. Long days stretched out before him, followed by even longer nights, filled with the quiet sounds of men sobbing.

“I mentally broke,” Ahmed said.

Ahmed is not his real name. He is an asylum seeker currently living in Charlottesville, who spoke with Charlottesville Tomorrow over a Zoom call with his attorney, and asked to not use his real name for his safety.

“I didn’t have any idea how to live in the jail, I didn’t know how to handle this circumstance,” Ahmed said.

That despair deepened when, like a growing number of immigrants detained recently in the United States, Ahmed was granted bond by an immigration court judge, meaning the judge granted his release until his court date. But the Department of Homeland Security refused to release him.

The decision stunned Ahmed and his attorney.

“The Department of Homeland Security filed what’s called an auto stay provision,” said Elizabeth Schmelzel, Ahmed’s attorney through the Legal Aid Justice Center. “This is authority that they have from a regulation just after Sept. 11, which allows them to refuse to release someone from immigration detention, even when they have been granted bond.”

DHS did not respond to Charlottesville Tomorrow’s request for comment.

The regulation she referred to is 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2), which says that DHS can “stay… any order of the immigration judge authorizing release” while the agency appeals the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative body for federal immigration laws.

“I have seen it used once in my career,” Schmelzel said. “It is usually used when the department has a very serious security concern. It is now being used blanketly.”

Across the country, immigration attorneys report that DHS is blocking bond releases more often than ever using this broad regulation, which does not require DHS to give a reason for keeping a person in detention. An Aug. 30 report in The Guardian highlighted several cases where immigrants won bond but were still kept in detention. An anonymous DHS official told the news outlet that government lawyers were instructed to put all bond rulings on hold — though DHS publicly denied that claim.

Faced with this incredible circumstance, immigrants and their attorneys are turning to the federal court system. There they file petitions of habeas corpus, a procedure that lets a judge decide whether someone’s detention is lawful. Filing this kind of petition is a drastic step, one that essentially argues that the government is holding someone illegally — in violation of its own Constitution.

And federal court judges are approving these petitions at a striking rate, according to Schmelzel and other immigration attorneys who have spoken publicly.

This was the case with Ahmed.

In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.

“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads. But under the current rules, government attorneys can still step in and block the judge’s decision on their own. The court blasted this as “patently unfair,” noting that it hands power to prosecutors who already lost their argument in front of a judge.

“The automatic stay imposed in immigration cases constitutes an unequivocal violation of due process. It is, in effect, no process at all,” Brinkema wrote.

Ahmed was released from the Farmville detention center that very day.

“My release is maybe a miracle,” Ahmed said, with a small smile. But the damage, he added, had already been done.

“I’m mentally still in detention,” he said, shifting uneasily as he spoke. “I can’t go out. If I go outside and see people — or police — I feel like they’re coming to arrest me.”

This was not the first time Ahmed has lived in fear, he said.

Ahmed is one of hundreds of thousands of people who seek asylum in the U.S. each year, saying they would face persecution if forced to return home: prison, torture, even death.

He shared with Charlottesville Tomorrow the story of his long journey and what brought him here. Many of the details could not be independently verified, a common challenge in reporting on people fleeing conflict, persecution or unstable governments. What follows is his personal account.

Violence forced Ahmed to flee his home country

Ahmed’s path to the U.S. began with a seemingly small decision. But one that he said set him apart in his home country of Bangladesh.

He wanted to be an artist.

“In my country, some people believe that drawing pictures is a religious sin,” Ahmed said, speaking through an interpreter. “For that reason, since I was a child, I have faced many problems from fundamentalists and extremists.”

He recalls one day, when he was in the seventh grade at an Islamic Study Center, he sketched a human figure on the blackboard.

“Seeing that, the instructor beat me with a long stick,” Ahmed said. “And once the stick was broken, he beat me with his hands and legs. These types of fundamentalists exist in our country.”

But Ahmed wanted to be an artist. And despite resistance from some in his community who he said believed his art was anti-Islamic, he became one. He earned a master’s degree in India, returned to Bangladesh, and soon was selling art and exhibiting in museums across Europe and Asia.

But his artwork made him a target, he said. And, in 2022, Ahmed displayed some artwork near his neighborhood. Soon after, a group of masked individuals surrounded him in the street and beat him. Badly.

“People in my area knew I was doing this kind of work — that I draw pictures and make sculptures,” he said. “That’s why they attacked me.”

By 2024, the situation had worsened.

That summer, the government re-instated a quota system for civil service jobs, which reserved about one-third of all government jobs for family members of people who had fought in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, Reuters reported. Students in the country protested, saying the quota favored the political party that was in power, the Awami League. Those protests exploded into a nationwide movement.

Authorities responded with force, imposing curfews, deploying security forces to universities, and cutting internet access as street clashes intensified. Weeks of violent clashes left more than 1,000 people dead. By Aug. 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had resigned and fled the country.

Since her ouster, the activities of her political party, the Awami League, have been banned by Bangladesh’s interim government and the party is being investigated for various abuses of power, according to reporting from DW, an international news network based in Germany.

Critics accuse the Awami League of steadily dismantling democratic checks in Bangladesh. Elections were boycotted or tightly controlled. Opposition figures were jailed. Laws limited what people could say online. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has said that Hasina’s government, along with some Awami League members, committed serious human rights violations. (You can read more from the U.N. and reporting from Reuters.)

But supporters say that same iron grip kept fundamentalist groups at bay. The party took a secular stance and cracked down on Islamist movements. To many Bangladeshis, the Awami League was both a threat to democratic freedoms — and the force keeping extremists from gaining power.

A few days after Hasina’s government fell, a group of men approached him on the street preparing to attack him, Ahmed said. This time, he ran.

“I ran far,” Ahmed said. “Like, 13 kilometers.”

While he was running, some of his attackers went to his family’s home looking for him. Others began sending him threatening text messages, he said.

So Ahmed fled.

“It’s not just me in Bangladesh — lots of actors, artists, writers, models have been forced to flee the country,” he said. “And you will see the houses of many singers and painters have been burned down.”

News outlets, including The Daily Star, the largest English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, are reporting stories of widespread destruction of art, particularly sculptures, in Bangladesh. But groups are also targeting singers and other artists, according to France 24, a Paris-based international news network.

‘I had no option to return back to anywhere’

Ahmed managed to get a Visa to Mexico, his attorney said.

But Mexico did not offer him the safety he sought. The day he arrived in the winter of 2024, he was violently mugged, he said.

He soon connected with a small community of Indian immigrants who told him that people of Indian or Pakistani descent were often targeted, and as a single man alone he was especially vulnerable to being kidnapped for extortion.

So, Ahmed began looking for a way to get to the United States.

His first attempt to simply approach a main border checkpoint on foot failed.

“I tried to talk to a U.S. border guard who could tell me whether I would be allowed to enter because I am going through these circumstances,” he said.

Video of the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville recorded in December 2019. Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

But people on the Mexican side of the gate prevented him from reaching a guard. So, Ahmed said he hired a taxi to drive him back to that same gate.

Instead, that taxi driver took him to a group of smugglers.

Ahmed didn’t know who these people were, but he said they took his money, all his possessions — including his few remaining paintings — and his passport.

The men then dropped him at the border.

“I had no option to return back to anywhere,” he said.

So he said that he simply waited for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to find him.

Once arrested and in ICE custody, Ahmed asked for asylum. It took DHS two days to process Ahmed’s request, set a date for him to appear for his asylum petition and release him on his own recognizance.

Ahmed said he had a friend who lived in Charlottesville, so in January 2025 he made his way here.

A routine ICE check-in resulted in Ahmed’s detention

For the next few months, Ahmed felt himself begin to relax. He made some friends who were studying at the University of Virginia and started looking for local artists to connect with.

“Every weekend, I visited a different type of art gallery to search for some artists. But I just saw some paintings, never the artists. My bad luck,” he said, with a chuckle.

Still, life was finally somewhat stable.

But this peace wouldn’t last.

At his first mandatory ICE check-in in July in Richmond, an official told him he must wear an ankle monitor. They placed it on his left leg, which has some nerve damage, he said. The device, which is large and frequently hot, caused excruciating pain.

He returned to his next ICE check-in with a doctor’s note in hand and asked that it be removed. The official he met with this time would not remove the monitor, but offered to put it on his other leg.

This is where Ahmed’s account diverges from what DHS presented in court.

According to DHS’ court filings, Ahmed “was unwilling to cooperate” and “it was determined that he would remain in custody pending his immigration proceedings.”

Ahmed said he had agreed to ICE’s offer, and while he was waiting for the official to move the monitor to his right leg, three ICE officers entered his room and forcefully arrested him.

“I was not trying to resist them or force them to do anything,” Ahmed said. “I was just asking that they install the ankle monitor on my right leg and let me go. But [the officer] tells me, ‘Your time is up. We gave you a chance and you did not take it.'”

From there, they took Ahmed to a waiting car and shoved him inside, he said.

At the detention center in Farmville, Ahmed’s mental health declined. He found himself experiencing symptoms of intense anxiety and depression. He asked to speak to a mental health counselor. Instead, he said he was sent to a man who instructed him to strategize for what to do once he was deported.

To cope, Ahmed returned to his one true passion in life: art.

He began drawing portraits of his fellow detainees.

“I probably did 100 portraits in two months,” he said. “Every day, I did one, two, three, four portraits.”

The other detainees were thrilled with the gifts, and gave him candies and snacks from the detention center’s commissary.

It’s the only artwork he’s really done since fleeing Bangladesh.

“I had just started my international career,” Ahmed said. “I want to try to build up my career internationally. But, right now, everything is stopped.”

Ahmed is still waiting for the U.S. Immigration Court to hear his asylum case, which is a long and complex legal proceeding.

“When I met [Ahmed], he wasn’t detained, so we were just kind of moving through his trial preparation,” Schmelzel, his attorney, said. “I handle a lot of cases, and my concern now is, because of so many changes in policy, any of my clients could be detained. And if that happens, we will have to stop and do the same thing.”

It took Schmelzel, her team at Legal Aid Justice Center and attorneys from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights two months of writing motions, petitions and attending court hearings to secure Ahmed’s release.

That’s time she would have liked to have spent preparing for the asylum trial, she said.

“We decided to authorize this body, the Department of Homeland Security, to be prosecutor, jailer and judge with that regulation,” Schmelzel said. “Think about what that really means. It is pretty shocking that the department can just ignore a judge’s order.”",https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-3.24.57-PM-scaled.png,N,,2025-10-06 17:58:00.368292

They include the fate of fired federal employees, the First Amendment and several executive orders.

Trump has been busy with his marker, signing more than 200 executive actions since returning to office in January. He's far outpacing recent predecessors and his first term.

And that has set another record — lawsuits.

“This is the most intense litigation against the president in recent history,” Ashraf Ahmed, an associate professor at Columbia Law School, told Spectrum News

The Supreme Court is expected to be the final word on many of the lawsuits. It's already allowing White House actions to stand while cases wind through the system.

Among them:

DOGE

The U.S. DOGE Service is the unofficial federal department that unilaterally got rid of more than a quarter of a million federal workers. According to reports, two labor unions are still fighting the Department of Government Efficiency’s ability to receive data from the Social Security Administration.

The court sided with Trump, allowing DOGE access while the case continues.

Advantage: Trump, for now

Birthright citizenship

Constitutional scholars have long argued the 14th Amendment finds those born on U.S. soil are citizens. That is, until the president signed an executive order saying it should not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants.

The Supreme Court still hasn't decided, but it did stop lower courts from issuing a nationwide injunction.

What does that mean? Across the U.S., a lack of clarity.

“What would be my guess, all things considered, will happen? Birthright citizenship will be preserved, but it's going to happen in a much more piecemeal, step-by-step litigation process,” Ahmed said.

Advantage: Unclear

Tariffs

The president has slapped tariffs on scores of countries, calling it a national emergency. But he did it unilaterally, violating the Constitution, a federal appeals court found in August.

The 7-4 decision concluded “the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution.” But it allowed tariffs to remain, at least for now.

If it rules, the Supreme Court would tackle two issues, Ahmed predicted.

“We've had trade deficits for decades. How can it now be a national emergency?” he said. “So that would be one claim.

“And the second would be Congress would never delegate this type of power.”

Advantage: Unclear

Free speech

The Trump administration marked at least two immigrants for deportation for their pro-Palestinian advocacy. It's a test of whether the First Amendment trumps a once-obscure federal law that allows the secretary of state to deport immigrants found to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

In a twist, a group of university professors is also suing, claiming that by silencing protesters, the White House denied their First Amendment rights as an audience.

“Now, this might strike some listeners as bizarre who are not familiar with First Amendment law, but this has been on books for decades, which is to say that the First Amendment not only protects our rights as speakers, but in many instances protects our rights as listeners, part of a public sphere, to hear controversial ideas, to be part of public discourse,” Ahmed said.

In late September, a federal judge found citizens and noncitizens have the same free speech rights. But observers say it's, again, unclear how the Supreme Court may rule.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tariffs_AP_25198293238565_NAT_0723,N,,2025-10-06 15:57:11.841396

A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country.
At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia.
Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.","GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to produce evidence within 48 hours on its efforts to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the southern African country of Eswatini.

That evidence from the Trump administration is due by Wednesday to Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis. She will consider an order to release Abrego Garcia as part of his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention at a U.S.immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

If the Trump administration is making no effort to remove Abrego Garcia, Xinis said the issue then becomes indefinite detainment of an individual, which runs against a Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants can’t be detained longer than six months if they are not in the process of being removed.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to his home country and to a notorious mega-prison before returning him to the United States to face criminal charges, has thrown the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown into the spotlight.

Xinis, nominated by former President Joe Biden, scheduled another hearing Friday, which will be about Abrego Garcia’s possible removal to Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The African country has aided the Trump administration in accepting third-country removals.

Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn during Monday’s hearing confirmed such a removal is planned at some point by the administration.

Xinis pressed DOJ attorneys on exactly what steps the federal government has taken to send Abrego Garcia to Eswatini.

Guynn said the federal government has not formally started a plan of removal, but said he could not confirm if removal plans were in motion. He argued that there are no imminent plans by the federal government to remove Abrego Garcia and the DOJ is trying to show that by keeping him in ICE custody.

“The government feels like it's in the damned if it does, damned if it doesn't, situation,” Guynn said. “The government has been trying to respond … about concerns that Mr. Abrego Garcia will be rapidly removed from the United States, notwithstanding his habeas case, and ongoing immigration proceedings, and so in an abundance of caution... the United States is not imminently planning to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia.”

Previously the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia to either Uganda or Eswatini.

DOJ attorneys also asked for a temporary stay in the habeas corpus petition because of the government shutdown.

Xinis denied the stay. She pointed to the DOJ's own shutdown contingency plan, which allows for litigation concerning habeas petitions to continue.

Protests in support of Abrego Garcia

About an hour before Monday’s hearing, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in front of the courthouse to continue its show of support for Abrego Garcia.

About 100 people led chants shouting, “We are Kilmar!” “No More” and “When we fight, we win!” and held signs in support of Abrego Garcia and criticizing the Trump administration.

Religious leaders said prayers and a few other people spoke, such as Krystal Oriadha, who serves as vice chair of the Prince George’s County Council. Oriadha’s father was born in Kenya and immigrated to the U.S., where he met her mother in college.

“I understand the story of immigration, and it’s one that has been such a story of pride in my life because it’s filled of sacrifice, yes and struggles, but pride and love for your family and hard work,” she said. “It is what every immigrant stands for, not the propaganda that this administration is propping up calling hardworking, loving families criminals, demonizing them. So let’s be careful and mindful of the propaganda that they’re spilling today.”

Tennessee charges

The federal judge in Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Tennessee, in which he is accused of human smuggling of immigrants, on Friday granted Abrego Garcia an evidentiary hearing. It will determine if those charges from the Trump administration are an illegal retaliation after Abrego Garcia successfully brought a suit challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador.

Separately, an immigration judge last week denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case.

Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. without legal authorization as a teenager in 2011. He tried to open an asylum case in 2019, but was denied because he did not apply within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.

The Friday decision from that immigration judge ends one of the efforts for Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to keep him in the U.S., due to his protections from deportation to El Salvador.

A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country.

At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia.

Six-month limit

Monday’s hearing focused on the time frame of Abrego Garcia’s detainment and whether it conflicted with a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled immigrants who are not in the process of removal cannot be kept in ICE detention for more than six months.

Xinis questioned the reason for Abrego Garcia’s detention since late August if the Trump administration had no evidence of its plans to remove the longtime Maryland man.

Another DOJ attorney, Bridget K. O’Hickey, said the federal government has not formalized a removal plan for Abrego Garcia, adding that she didn’t know if there were any plans in the process.

Xinis called a short break in the middle of Monday’s hearing to give the DOJ attorneys time to make any calls to get information if the Trump administration was removing him.

DOJ attorney Ernesto H. Molina said he was unable to reach anyone, pointing to the possible furlough of federal workers.

“It just is remarkable to me that you're saying you can't find a soul who can give you, in this case, any additional information,” Xinis said. “That suggests there is none.”

One of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers in the Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, argued that if the Trump administration wanted to remove Abrego Garcia, they would send him to Costa Rica, which has already agreed to accept Abrego Garicia as a refugee.

Xinis asked why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

“We've received no communications, and I can't even wrap my brain to think of a constitutionally permissible reason why they would be fighting over whether to send them across the Atlantic Ocean when they can, this afternoon, send him to Costa Rica,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Xinis asked the DOJ attorneys if there has been any effort to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, but Molina and O’Hickey said they have not been informed of those efforts.

Human smuggling charges

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration was trying to force him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and was ordered released by the federal judge in Tennessee to await his trial there in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States.

In late August, after Abrego Garcia was released from U.S. Marshals Service custody in Tennessee, immigration officials informed him he had to appear in Baltimore before the ICE field office for a check-in appointment. During that appointment, Abrego Garcia was detained.

Xinis has previously ordered the Trump administration cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. while his habeas petition continues, and that he must be kept within 200 miles of the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.

CHICAGO — In the wake of aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, some elected officials and union leaders are calling on the community to help protect immigrant students and their families.

Chicago Public Schools is also reminding families that it doesn’t collect immigration information and that parents should provide emergency contact information to schools.

The messages from CPS, the Chicago Teachers Union, and state and local elected representatives came after a mother and her children, ages 8 and 3, were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at Millennium Park last weekend. Their comments also come after federal agents rappelled onto an apartment building in South Shore on Tuesday, where ICE arrested more than 30 people. Many migrant families have settled in the South Side neighborhood in recent years.

Chicago Public Schools did not say whether South Shore-area schools had planned or offered additional support for their students this week after the raid.

During a press conference Thursday outside of Roosevelt High School in the immigrant-rich neighborhood of Albany Park, teachers and elected officials reported ICE activity and arrests in the neighborhood Wednesday, including near schools. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not confirm whether ICE detained anyone near the school or elsewhere in the neighborhood.

“I am standing here with educators, teachers, school clerks, teachers assistants, social workers and nurses to say that again … They are not welcome to pick up parents and detain them after they drop their children off at our schools. They are not welcome in our neighborhoods to terrorize, to ask for papers,” Stacy Davis Gates, president of the CTU, told reporters.

In a Wednesday letter to CPS families, interim CPS CEO Macquline King said teachers do not ask students or families for immigration status, and CPS does not share student records with ICE or other federal representatives without a court order or consent from the student’s guardian. Her letter also reminded families that schools do not allow federal agents inside without a criminal judicial warrant signed by a federal judge.

Evelyn Gonzalez, a teacher and CTU delegate at Roosevelt, said teachers volunteered to stay late at the building Wednesday for kids who felt safer staying back.

“There were businesses offering refuge in case we needed it, and there were neighbors from our community stepping up to make sure our students were safe walking home,” Gonzalez said. “I hope that we can stand together and that we can care for each other.”

Ald. Rossana Rodriguez, whose ward includes Albany Park, said she closed her office early Wednesday so that she and staff could help monitor school dismissal. Her office and community organizers were able to gather 50 people in about two hours who would help “notify the community” in case ICE agents showed up, she said.

State Sen. Graciela Guzman told reporters that the children and mother arrested at Millennium Park have been released, and the 8-year-old girl went to school Thursday, crediting advocacy from the community. A federal judge ordered that both are protected from deportation for now, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“She went to school today and she played in her playground today,” Guzman said.

The White House said in a statement to Fox News Digital that every shutdown comes with consequences.
""The Democrats can reopen the government at any time,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Monday.","This government shutdown isn’t President Donald Trump’s first rodeo navigating a lapse in government funding — but this time, the focus is less on the White House as all eyes are locked on Congress and its budget impasse.

While the 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first term centered around the president's priorities to fund a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the current shutdown doesn’t pit the White House against the legislative branch.

Rather, there is a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over certain healthcare provisions — alleviating pressure on the White House and giving Trump time to post videos showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a sombrero in an AI-generated clip underscoring Republicans' claims that Democrats want to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Here's What Trump Wants To Do To Reshape The Federal Government During The Shutdown

This paves the way for Trump to remain in the wings during the partial shutdown, and let Democrats take the fall for the consequences, according to libertarian political columnist Kristin Tate.

""By staying relatively quiet right now, President Trump is allowing Democrats to ‘own’ the shutdown,"" Tate said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""The president realizes that if he says anything confrontational right now, the narrative will center around his remarks rather than the Democrats' refusal to support a reasonable spending bill.""

""By maintaining a low profile, Trump is allowing the public to see how the Democrats are acting,"" Tate said. ""The Democrats will ultimately bear most of the political consequences of the shutdown.""

The government entered a partial shutdown Wednesday, amid a stalemate between Senate Republicans and Democrats over a short-term funding bill to keep the government open through Nov. 21. The House had previously passed the temporary spending bill in September.

Three Senate Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the stopgap funding bill Tuesday, but the measure fell short of the required 60 votes needed for passage.

Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have claimed Democrats are seeking to provide health care for illegal immigrants, keeping the government from operating. They cite a provision that would repeal part of Trump’s tax and domestic policy bill — the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" — which scaled back Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens.

But Democrats have said Republicans’ claims are false, and instead, have said they want to permanently extend certain Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to lapse at the end of 2025.

Republicans Erupt Over Shutdown Chaos, Accuse Dems Of Holding Government 'Hostage'

""They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. ""That is absolutely false. That is one of the big lies that they tell.""

The shutdown differs from the one during Trump’s first term, where Trump and Democrats in Congress sparred about nearly $6 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall in the spending bill for weeks.

Ultimately, Trump backed off amid mounting pressure to reopen the government so federal employees could resume being paid after weeks of stalled payroll, and signed off on legislation to temporarily reopen the government without the border wall funding.

Matt Wolking, who previously served as the deputy communications director for Trump's 2020 campaign, said that the main difference between this shutdown in comparison to the previous one is that Democrats are the one requesting a policy change — not the White House.

""Trump is as engaged as ever — and using humor effectively, of course — and the biggest difference between now and then is that now it's Democrats who are demanding a specific policy change,"" Wolking said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""They voted against funding the government because they want taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, and that's why Trump and Republicans are well positioned to win the shutdown messaging battle this time.""

Additionally, Republican strategist Matt Gorman said that Democrats have put themselves in a tough position since they were the ones that voted against the continuing resolution.

""Times have shown over and over through the years that the public supports funding the government. They penalize the party that attaches extra policy priorities to whatever bill does that,"" Gorman, who previously served as the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""You're already seeing moderate Democrats splinter off. As this goes on, I expect that to continue.""

Meanwhile, Trump is taking advantage of the shutdown to advance his priorities to whittle down the federal government in an unprecedented move. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget ordered agencies in September to draw up plans for a reduction-in-force in the event of a lapse in appropriations.

Government Shuts Down After Congress Deadlocks On Spending Deal

While federal employees typically are furloughed during government shutdowns, the Trump administration’s plans would permanently scale back the size of the federal workforce if a government shutdown occurs.

""Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud,"" Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday. ""Billions of Dollars can be saved. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Vice President JD Vance has adopted a proactive role carrying the administration’s position, and told reporters Tuesday he predicted the shutdown wouldn’t last long. Specifically, he said that evidence suggests moderate Democrats are ""cracking a little"" because they understand the ""fundamental illogic"" of the shutdown.

Still, he said that layoffs were forthcoming. Trump said Sunday that layoffs were ""taking place right now"" as thousands of workers' jobs remain in jeopardy.

""We're going to have to make things work,"" Vance said. ""And that means that we're going to have to triage some certain things, that means certain people are going to have to get laid off. And we're going to try to make sure that the American people suffer as little as possible from the shutdown.""

The White House said in a statement to Fox News Digital that every shutdown comes with consequences.

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romeo with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

Each day before sunrise, David Huerta checks his rearview mirror for immigration enforcement agents as he drives through the dark to a warehouse in a southwest Chicago suburb. Once he’s clocked in, he peers periodically through the windows on the truck dock, making sure ICE isn’t there. For hours this will go on, as he unloads pallets heavy with sacks of flour and salt, bound for grocery stores nationwide.

When trucks pull into the dock, Huerta readies his forklift to begin unloading the pallets, but first, he must interact with the drivers.

Most are professional while filling out the required paperwork. However, some of the drivers harass him, behavior that has increased since President Trump took office in January.

“The most degrading thing is when the drivers arrive with their MAGA caps and they ask, ‘Hey, when are you going back to Mexico?’ ” said Huerta, who works for a company that makes baking mixes and nutritional powders. “ ‘Soon, don’t worry about it.’ That’s the only answer you give, because you can’t say more, because you don’t know if when you close the door, they’ll make a call and say, ‘Hey, there’s some Mexicans in here.’ ”

Huerta is one of the 68,000 workers in the Chicago region’s food and beverage manufacturing sector, according to a 2023 report from World Business Chicago, an economic development agency. Warehouses operated by some of the nation’s largest food brands accept raw products from farms that are processed and mixed into edible goods, boxed, packaged and shipped to grocery stores and restaurants nationwide.

The labor force of forklift drivers, box packers, mixers and inspectors that has helped turn Chicago into a global logistical hub is largely fueled by immigrants with varying legal statuses.

For decades, those jobs have often been difficult and sometimes unsafe, with undocumented workers having little recourse when their rights were violated. In recent years, worker advocates have said that state and federal policies have made progress in protecting vulnerable immigrants who anchor the region’s growing food logistics industry.

But now, the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies have revived fears that recent gains are unraveling and the stability of the region’s food system will be shaken. Trump has ended deportation deferral programs, increased workplace raids and sued the state of Illinois over some of its labor laws.

Most notably, Trump terminated a Biden-era program called Deferred Action for Labor Enforcement, or DALE, which allowed undocumented workers who spoke out about labor violations to apply for a four-year work permit, essentially removing the threat of deportation.

Huerta was granted a permit through DALE in 2024.

He and dozens of other undocumented temp workers made formal complaints against their employer, a third-party food logistics company with several locations throughout the Chicago area. The workers alleged that management discriminated by giving them heavy or dangerous jobs that the company knew they couldn’t refuse because of their immigration status. As a result, Huerta was granted a temporary work permit and was able to switch jobs.

“It turns out that the mistreatment, the distinction between full-time workers and temp workers is quite significant, because full-time workers are not usually given jobs that are as heavy as those given to agency workers,” Huerta said.

Huerta feels vulnerable, even though he is, for the first time in 26 years, able to work legally in the U.S.

“It’s true that right now, I have my work permit, but it’s the same thing, you’re still undocumented, you’re still the one who has no say,” said Huerta, whose temporary work permit does not provide a path to citizenship.

To better understand how Trump’s immigration policies are reshaping Chicago and its role in the national food system, Investigate Midwest spoke with dozens of warehouse workers, food manufacturers, immigrant advocates, lawmakers and neighborhood leaders.

The increase in workplace raids across the country has made many too afraid to show up for work.

Companies have laid off hundreds of people after Trump revoked some work permit programs. In suburban Schaumburg, more than 500 people were laid off in April from Nestlé USA’s Nation Pizza, the maker of DiGiorno and other popular frozen pizza brands.

The end of DALE underscores a broader shift. Once seen as a tool to encourage workers to come forward about labor violations, its cancellation signals the administration’s possible intent to not investigate workplace violations.

“The climate of uncertainty that has been created here, I think it’s particularly punitive, and it is affecting the food supply chain,” said Nik Theodore, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois Chicago. “There are wide-ranging impacts here, in very uncertain times.”

Temp work, exploitation and the fight for protections

Even before the first non-Indigenous settlers arrived in the Chicago area, the land between the Upper Mississippi River System and the Great Lakes was a confluence of trade.

Over the past 170 years, the addition of railroads, river ports, major highways and airports has turned Chicago into one of the largest logistics hubs on the continent.

As the region’s manufacturing sector declined in the 1970s, the area leaned into its logistics industry, which became “an economic fix,” according to José Miguel Acosta-Córdova, an economic geographer and historian.

“There was a large area of land available for purchase for development west of the city, and you had eager governments,” Acosta-Córdova said of the collar counties, a five-county region west of Chicago. “There’s the need to move goods efficiently and rapidly around the world, and the need to store those goods as they were moving, right? So then the ’80s and ’90s and onwards, you see this huge logistics boom started happening.”

As massive warehouses were built, thousands of new jobs were created.

Over the last century, America’s agriculture and food production industries — including meatpacking plants, corn fields and industrial animal farms — have increasingly relied on immigrant labor as a way to maintain low pay and substandard working conditions.

With few other options, some of the immigrants who have flocked to jobs at Chicago’s food warehouses told Investigate Midwest they are forced to deal with demanding quotas and unsafe conditions.

“I came to this country with the American dream,” said Ricardo César González-Valentína, a warehouse worker from Mexico City. “But [abuse] begins to take away a piece of your life, of your body. You come here to work, you don’t come to do bad things. When I get to know the warehouses, it’s work that sustains the country, because that’s truly what we do. Contributing our part so that every American, from every country, can be fed. It has to pass through working hands. And those hands are mostly Latinos, from the moment a seed is harvested, from the moment it is planted, it blossoms, and the fruit emerges.”

While roughly 42% of farm workers are undocumented, less is known about how many undocumented people work in food manufacturing because it’s not tracked by a federal agency.

“This is a number that’s kind of difficult to put your finger on,” said Theodore, the UIC professor. “What we do know is that these workers are the backbone of the food system in Illinois and nationwide.”

Even before Trump’s second term, the food supply chain struggled to find enough workers, but in recent months, farms, meatpacking plants and warehouses have reported a rise in labor shortages. The work can be physically demanding and repetitive, and the pay is low. Huerta is paid $18 an hour to drive a forklift all day.

Theodore believes Trump’s mass deportations will worsen the problem.

“Labor markets are not going to just seamlessly adjust without friction,” Theodore said. “I don’t think that there is a waiting workforce that is hoping to be employed by food processing plants. And this applies both to the city of Chicago, the collar counties, the rest of Illinois, and the major food manufacturing belts in Nebraska, in Iowa and elsewhere.”

Many individuals employed in the food distribution and processing industries are hired by temporary staffing agencies that often do not provide a clear pathway to full-time employment. This arrangement creates a “permatemp” workforce that critics say traps people in low-paying and sometimes hazardous jobs for decades.

González-Valentína, the warehouse worker from Mexico City, received a work permit through the DALE program before Trump took office. He described the food logistics company he previously worked for as “a mafia.”

“They fire people every six months. The company won’t let you have seniority because it doesn’t want to give benefits,” he said. “When we were there, they fired people every six months and still had the nerve to hire another 100 people.”

Worker centers in and around Chicago have attempted to advocate for better pay and benefits, increased safety and more job security. But the decks are stacked against temp workers, according to Maria Alfaro, an organizer with Warehouse Workers for Justice.

“If [a higher up] doesn’t like you, they’ll give the harder spots to the people that don’t have status, because they know that they need the job. And if they complain, they can get rid of them,” Alfaro said.

“That’s where people are getting hurt. People are getting hernias. People are getting their hands messed up with rotary tears because of the weight that they have to carry. And some of these people are women, you know, puny women that are carrying 50-pound bags. I don’t know how they do it all day.”

In recent years, Illinois lawmakers enacted measures enshrining public education rights for children of undocumented parents, approved driver’s licenses for noncitizens, and restricted state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

Legislators also required employers to notify workers within five business days when federal authorities flag discrepancies in their E-Verify — the voluntary federal system that verifies worker eligibility — or I-9 employment forms. An I-9 audit means that ICE or the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division within ICE may do an on-site investigation of a worksite. A raid is different in that it won’t be announced. The law also prohibits employers from screening job applicants through E-Verify before hiring.

In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Illinois, arguing that its state law interferes with immigration enforcement. A federal judge in Chicago dismissed that lawsuit in August.

This past legislative session, lawmakers also nearly passed amendments to the Privacy in the Workplace Act, which would have allowed worker centers and workers, regardless of their immigration status, to sue employers for violating their rights. The proposal was a response to the Trump administration’s funding cuts to federal labor enforcement.

Those funding cuts could put more pressure on states to investigate worker violations, but Illinois is facing its own funding challenges.

“The state is in financial straits,” said State Rep. Edgar Gonzalez, a Chicago Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, who said the proposal will be brought back in November. “And we don’t want to impose too much on the attorney general’s office, or anybody who would need to enforce this. Allowing the interested party [to sue] allows them to go through other mechanisms in order to seek remediation.”

One of the most significant improvements for undocumented workers prior to the second Trump administration came with the federal DALE program, which allowed undocumented workers to avoid deportation if they had credible information about a workplace violation.

Before DALE, a complaint could mean losing a job.

“Complaining means they tell you they don’t need you anymore,” said Huerta, the worker from Puebla.

DALE gave labor agencies access to workers and victims when investigating a potential case of child labor violations or a preventable fatality.

“It made doing their work a bit easier,” said Ann Garcia, a senior staff attorney with the National Immigration Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “Investigators could look into [reports] and not lose out on potential witnesses who otherwise wouldn’t have been there.”

However, Trump ended DALE soon after becoming president, a move first reported by Bloomberg Law.

Although only about 7,700 people had been granted DALE status by late 2024 (a fraction of the undocumented workforce), its end has had a ripple effect: Worker centers and community groups told Bloomberg they stopped filing applications altogether, fearing immigration authorities could use the personal information.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processed DALE applications, did not respond to questions from Investigate Midwest.

“Unfortunately, we’re kind of back to a situation today where neither of these agencies can do their work adequately,” Garcia said. “There’s really no possibility at this point of getting this kind of relief.”

Garcia believes DALE could make a comeback, though, with the next administration in 2029.

“I am hopeful that if we get a change in an administration that’s more positive, then we might be able to pick up from where we left off,” she said. “We were just getting started building trust and getting the word out.”

Fear of ICE shapes life inside Chicago’s warehouses

For many warehouse workers, the greatest fear is an ICE raid.

Chicago has been a focal point for the Department of Homeland Security, but federal agents have focused mostly on street arrests, using traffic checkpoints or entering public parks.

Workplace raids have been rare, but there’s worry from both employers and employees.

Some workers, who did not want their names published for fear of deportation, said they worry each time they leave for work. “I think we all worry about whether we’re going to come back or not,” said a mother of two from Mexico.

Brenda Palomares, a worker from the Mexican state of Guerrero, said the fear in her community reminds her of the shelter-in-place rules during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think that this year, this year in particular, will be a year that no one will ever forget,” Palomares said. “It will go down in history, just like the pandemic. Right now, we’re in another pandemic, but it’s Trump’s pandemic, because they are tearing so many families apart.”

Since Trump took office, several food processing and warehouse businesses have reached out to local worker centers to ask how they should handle a raid.

“We’re normally training workers and fighting the boss, but now we’re helping to train bosses how (to) protect your workers,” said Shelly Ruzicka, communications and finance director for ARISE, an advocacy group for temporary workers.

Kevin Amaro from Illinois Workers in Action, a Chicago-based worker center, said that preparing for an ICE raid is a lot like conducting a fire drill. It involves educating management about what their rights are and what to do if ICE comes to their facility, because “a lot of employers are scared, too.”

“We have a checklist…we really work with companies to strategize and figure out this plan,” Amaro said. “ I mean real training, not just ‘here’s a 10-minute talk. Here’s a flyer.’ Great. You ready? No, like an actual in-depth, 40 minutes or more, check-in and plan.”

He emphasized the importance of not volunteering information beyond what’s legally required, and understanding the difference between audits, E-Verify checks and raids.

“There’s rights for everyone,” he said, “no matter your immigration status.”

The lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago alleges Trump’s authorization Saturday to deploy 300 troops to the Windy City is “unlawful and dangerous.”

Trump continues to flex federal power and claims the troops are needed to protect federal buildings during immigration enforcement efforts.

But a federal judge Sunday told Trump he couldn’t send troops to Oregon — hours after that state’s governor said 101 California National Guard members already had arrived Saturday with more on the way and headed to Portland.

Sending the National Guard to states despite their governor’s objections is not a new idea in Trump’s inner circle.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in November 2023 that a second Trump administration would order the Guard in sympathetic Republican-led states to Democrat-run states that refuse to cooperate with his drive for mass deportations.

“The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia. And if you’re going to go into an unfriendly state like Maryland, well, there would just be Virginia doing the arrest in Maryland, right, very close, very nearby,” Miller said at the time on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

READ MORE: Chicago and Illinois sue to block Trump’s Guard deployment plan after Portland ruling

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Portland, Chicago and elsewhere:

Trump’s efforts meet pushback

The lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago comes after Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to the nation’s third-largest city, along with 400 others from Texas.

The ACLU of Illinois also filed suit Monday against Trump, DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and several of these agencies’ national and local leaders, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of protests outside an ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

At the facility, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least seven people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

Filed by a coalition of news outlets, media associations and protesters — including the Illinois Press Association, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Headline Club — the lawsuit alleges federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and press.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint says.

Latest federal deployments target Portland, Chicago

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed that the president authorized using the Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, calling the former a “war zone” and suggesting apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore, Maryland; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek talked to Trump in late September and said the deployment was unnecessary. She refused to call up any Oregon National Guard troops, so Trump did so himself in an order to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That prompted the lawsuit from city and state officials.

In Chicago, alarms raised about racial profiling

On Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring federal agents from using city-owned property as staging areas. It applies to parking lots, garages and vacant lots.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said in a statement.

The sight of armed, camouflaged and masked Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous downtown landmarks has amplified concerns about racial profiling. Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that federal agents shot a woman Saturday morning on the southwest side of Chicago. A statement from the department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area “were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

“The officers exited their trapped vehicle, when a suspect tried to run them over, forcing the officers to fire defensively,” the statement said.

No law enforcement officers were seriously injured, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

The woman who was shot was a U.S. citizen and was armed with a semiautomatic weapon, according to McLaughlin.

The woman was in fair condition at a hospital, according to fire officials.

Deployment in Portland blocked by judge

About 400 protesters marched Saturday from a park to a Portland ICE detention facility. Federal agents used chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls, the Oregonian reported.

At least six people were arrested as the group reached the facility.

Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut later issued her first ruling temporarily blocking the deployment on Saturday afternoon, saying the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing that the deployment could harm Oregon’s state sovereignty.

The Trump administration responded with another attempt to send in National Guard troops from California and Texas, prompting Kotek and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, to go back to court Sunday. Immergut granted the request, blocking any National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon for 14 days.

Efforts in Memphis and Louisiana

On Wednesday, Hegseth, Bondi and Miller rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force that began operating in Memphis as part of Trump’s crime-fighting plan. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has supported the effort.

On Sept. 30, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry asked for a guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities to help fight crime.

He said there has been “elevated violent crime rates” in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as well as shortages in local law enforcement.

Appellate court weighs California deployment

Trump deployed guard soldiers and active duty Marines in Los Angeles during the summer over the objections of Gov. Newsom, who sued and won a temporary block after a federal judge found the president’s use of the guard was likely unlawful.

The Trump administration appealed, and the block was put on hold by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate case is still underway, but the panel has indicated that it believes the administration is likely to prevail.

Last year, the Biden administration paused the contract with Paragon Solutions, which operates Graphite, while it conducted a review to ensure it complied with an executive order issued in 2023 which limits the government’s use of spyware. In August, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, news that was first reported by All-Source Intelligence.

The letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was signed by Democratic Reps. Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Shontel Brown (Ohio), and Yassamin Ansari (Arizona).

The lawmakers asked Noem to provide information on the government’s use of surveillance technology by October 14, including “a comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use to spyware “threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech.”

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” they wrote.

Paragon was founded in 2019 by former Israeli military intelligence officers who worked in the Israeli military’s Unit 8200. Last year, the Florida-based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, bought Paragon.

Recently, Microsoft blocked Unit 8200’s access to its cloud software after an investigation published in The Guardian revealed that the unit was using the cloud to store information on Palestinians — information that was then used to plan deadly attacks on Gaza.

Paragon has been repeatedly accused of violating people’s human rights. Earlier this year, the company was embroiled in a scandal after investigations revealed that the software had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Europe.

“There’s no link to click, attachment to download, file to open or mistake to make,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the Associated Press of Graphite. “One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.

Researchers with The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, conducted a forensic analysis of two reporters’ phones — “a prominent European journalist” who asked to remain anonymous, and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino. Both journalists’ phones were targeted with Graphite, according to the researchers’ report released in June.

Amnesty International says Graphite “can never be human rights compliant and should be banned.”

“Paragon’s Graphite spyware product is a form of highly invasive spyware capable of covertly accessing the most intimate and sensitive data on an individual’s phone, and cannot be independently audited,” the group said in March.

The letter to Noem comes as the Trump administration has targeted anyone it perceives as an enemy, including pro-Palestine activists, anti-ICE protesters, and Democratic elected officials. On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.

In comments to Truthout on Monday, Lee said that she will “not allow ICE to operate in the shadows.”

“Once that kind of surveillance is allowed, it rarely stays limited to whatever the government claims it is for,” she said. “History shows what happens when governments are given this kind of unchecked access. It leads to intimidation, to silence, to control. And too often, it is immigrants, organizers, and people speaking out for justice who feel it first.

Fire destroys home of South Carolina judge who had received death threats

Edward Helmore

The cause of a huge fire at the beachfront home of a South Carolina judge who had reportedly been subjected to death threats is being investigated by state law enforcement investigators.

The blaze at the home of Diane Goodstein – a Democrat-appointed circuit court judge – erupted on Saturday, sending three members of her family to the hospital, including her husband, a former state senator.

However, Goodstein, 69, was walking her dogs at the time the blaze erupted at the three-story home in the luxury gated community on Edisto Beach in Colleton county.

A spokesperson for the South Carolina state law enforcement division (Sled) confirmed it was investigating a fire in the county. “The investigation is active and ongoing. More information may be available as the investigation continues,” a Sled spokesperson told FITSNews.

For his part, John Kittredge, the South Carolina chief justice, told the outlet: “At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Sled chief Mark Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security.”

Goodstein, who has served on the state judicial bench since 1989, in September issued a temporary injunction on the release of the state’s voter files to the Trump administration-led US justice department.

Goodstein’s ruling was later publicly criticized by an assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon. The division has been at the forefront of efforts to acquire information, including names, addresses, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, of more than 3 million registered voters under an executive order targeting “non-citizen voter registration”.

During her press briefing, Leavitt also claimed that the Democratic funding proposal would “require Medicaid to pay more for emergency care provided to illegal aliens than it does for American patients who are disabled, elderly or children”.

This statement is not true, mainly because emergency Medicaid is a way for hospitals to get reimbursement for providing care for any patient, regardless of immigration status, as required under federal law. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the president earlier this year, cut those federal dollars, and Democrats are seeking to reverse that through their funding extension.

What’s more, according to a recent analysis by KFF, emergency Medicaid spending accounted for less than 1% of the program’s total expenditure between 2017-2023.

White House reaffirms that layoffs will be an 'unfortunate consequence' of government shutdown, blames Democratic lawmakers

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the layoffs that the president has telegraphed will be an “unfortunate consequence” of the government shutdown – of which the administration continues to blame Democratic members of congress.

“This conversation about layoffs would not be happening right now if the Democrats did not vote to shut the government down,” Leavitt said.

The administration, including Russ Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, has said that the sweeping reductions-in-force (RIFs) would come as a byproduct of the government shutdown if Trump feels that negotiations to pass a funding extension remain at a standstill.

The Senate will reconvene later today, where the dueling stopgap bills are poised to be rejected again. “We hope that the vote will not fail, because this administration wants to reopen the government. We don’t want to see people laid off,” Leavitt added.

Leavitt calls Trump-appointed judge 'untethered in reality' following national guard ruling

Karoline Leavitt said that the ruling from Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed federal judge, was “untethered in reality”.

Immergut temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any national guard units to Oregon, saying that there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated the presence of national guard troops.

Leavitt said that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Portland has been “really under siege by these anarchists”.

“They have been disrespecting law enforcement. They’ve been inciting violence,” she added. “We are appealing that decision, as you know, we expect a hearing on it pretty quickly, and we’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this.”

Leavitt went on to criticize Democratic leaders throughout the country, like JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom, for pushing back against the administration’s use of federal troops in blue cities.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place? They should be concerned about this. They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night, and the president all he’s trying to do is fix it,” the press secretary said.

White House touts ongoing negotiations in Egypt as 'incredible achievement'

Karoline Leavitt branded the ongoing technical talks in Egypt between negotiators, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, as “incredible”.

“The president wants to see a cease fire. He wants to see the hostages released, and the technical teams are discussing that as we speak, to ensure that the environment is perfect to release those hostages,” Leavitt said. “They’re going over the list of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released. And those talks are underway, and the President is very much on the ball and is being apprised of this situation.”

The press secretary just noted that Donald Trump has been in touch with Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.

“The president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown,” Leavitt said. “His position is very clear. There’s nothing to negotiate. Just reopen the government and then we can talk about all the important issues facing our country.”

White House repeats misleading claims that Democrats are trying to fund health care for ‘illegal aliens’

At today’s press briefing, Karoline Leavitt continued to repeat the misleading claims from the president and congressional Republicans that the Democrats’ version of a stopgap funding bill is seeking to fund health care for “illegal aliens”.

This is not accurate, as we’ve reported extensively. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health insurance. The Democrats’ funding patch seeks to reverse many of the cuts to Medicaid that are set to take effect after Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda passed earlier this year.

This includes allowing lawfully present noncitizens to still enroll in certain federal health care programs. Leavitt called these immigrants “illegal aliens” who “improperly were granted asylum and paroled under the Biden administration”. All of these people have entered the country legally and are accounted for by the federal government.

Ahead of the White House press briefing, it’s worth noting that a short while ago, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, signed an executive order to establish “Ice free zones” throughout the city.

This order prohibits immigration agents from using city property to carry out any federal immigration operations. “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said.

He went on to support Illinois governor JB Pritzker’s lawsuit against the Trump administration for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago. “We reject any attempt to occupy Chicago and we will use every tool at our disposal to resist this federal overreach,” the mayor added.

“We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States,” Trump added in a post on Truth Social.

As ordered by Mayor Johnson, City Departments and agencies will identify all spaces that have been or may be used for federal immigration enforcement operations.
This could include, but is not limited to, ensuring that, wherever possible, physical barriers such as locked gates are used to limit access to City property for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.

The order expands upon Mayor Johnson’s Protecting Chicago initiative, inviting local businesses and community organizations to join the citywide effort to safeguard our communities, while advancing measures to rein in the reckless behavior of federal immigration agents.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority. ICE agents are detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents. We will not stand for that in our city,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “With this Executive Order, Chicago stands firm in protecting the Constitutional rights of our residents and immigrant communities and upholding our democracy.”

Mayor Johnson’s most recent Protecting Chicago executive order comes following documented use of Chicago Public Schools parking lots and a City-owned parking lot at Harrison and Kedzie as staging sites for federal immigration enforcement operations, a violation of Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance. The use of City resources for these actions erodes trust between immigrant communities and the City, weakening the relationships that are essential to ensuring community safety and constitutional policing.

Under Mayor Johnon’s leadership, the City is taking swift and decisive action to prevent these transgressions and wield municipal power to protect the safety, dignity, and human rights of every Chicagoan, regardless of race, religion, immigration status, or national origin. As ordered by Mayor Johnson, City Departments and agencies will identify all spaces that have been or may be used for federal immigration enforcement operations. City workers will then ensure that all such properties exhibit clear signage stating:

This property is owned and/or controlled by the City of Chicago.

It may not be used for civil immigration enforcement, including as a:

Staging area

Processing location

Operations base

City Departments and Agencies are directed to implement this order within five days. This could include, but is not limited to, ensuring that, wherever possible, physical barriers such as locked gates are used to limit access to City property for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.

The measure directs that City employees immediately report any attempted use of City property for immigration enforcement; any such instance will be reported to the Office of the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel.

The directive is the latest City-led effort to protect the Constitutional rights of every Chicagoan in concert with Mayor Johnson’s landmark Protecting Chicago initiative. Under Mayor Johnson’s leadership, the City is taking proactive steps to maintain essential trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement while ensuring every Chicagoan can feel safe while accessing City services.

In widely reported incidents, federal agents have been caught on video deploying tear gas outside a public school, acting outside their jurisdiction while putting a resident in a chokehold, and handcuffing a sitting member of the Chicago City Council.

In the wake of the ongoing incursion on the Constitutional rights of Chicagoans and the operations of federal immigration agents designed to stoke fear in communities across Chicago, Mayor Johnson is taking decisive action to protect Chicago’s immigrant community and the Constitutional rights of all Chicagoans.

Today’s order enables increased community participation in the Protecting Chicago initiative. The Mayor’s Office will design and distribute official signage, free of charge, that private landowners and leaseholders can post on their property. The signage clearly states that no federal immigration agents may enter for the purpose of civil immigration enforcement and that the property may not be used as a staging area, processing location, or operations base.

The City will distribute “Know Your Rights” materials that explain the rights of employees, tenants, and security staff when approached by federal agents seeking access to a property

This order does not prohibit the lawful use of City property for purposes unrelated to federal immigration enforcement.

Additional information on Protecting Chicago can be found at chicago.gov/protect. The signed Executive Order will be posted on the City Clerk’s website.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday criticized a federal judge for blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, calling her ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“The president has the right to call up the National Guard in cases where he deems it appropriate,” Leavitt said during a news briefing, accusing protesters outside a Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility of “inciting violence.”

Leavitt’s criticism came after US District Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy National Guard troops from other states to the ICE facility.

The administration has since filed an appeal, which Leavitt said Trump expects to win.

“We’re confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we’re very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” she said.

Pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on the administration’s justification for ordering the National Guard to Portland, Leavitt said protesters at the ICE facility had been “disrespecting law enforcement.” She added that the White House will soon host “independent journalists” who have been at the protests to share their first-person accounts.

Over the weekend, demonstrators gathered outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb. Six people were arrested Saturday and one on Sunday, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spent part of Friday on the rooftop of the controversial facility, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew, according to CNN affiliate WLS.

In recent weeks, protests at the facility have been met with tear gas and use of force, including against lawmakers.

Daniel Biss, the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, who is also running for Congress, said he was teargassed at a protest outside Broadview and called the experience “terrifying.” Kat Abughazaleh, a former journalist also running for Congress, was pushed to the ground by a federal law enforcement agent in camouflage, wearing a full face covering, sunglasses and a helmet, during the same protest, according to video from CNN affiliate WBBM.

After a protest Friday, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes said she was handcuffed in a hospital emergency room during a confrontation with two men she said were ICE agents. Neither was wearing badges.

In their lawsuit Monday to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, city and state leaders argue the military is not necessary to keep order during ongoing protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview.

“The manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the lawsuit states.

Arguing that the need for extra protection in response to protests around federal facilities is only a pretext to deploy the military inside the United States, the 67-page lawsuit cites President Trump’s own words, calling for military action in Chicago even before his second term began.

“The next president needs to send the National Guard to the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago until safety can be restored,” Trump said in July 2022, the lawsuit notes.

The plaintiffs also note the president’s provocative words in a speech last week to military generals in Quantico, Virginia.

“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military – National Guard, but military – because we’re going into Chicago very soon,” Trump said.

While Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is fighting Trump’s effort to federalize the Illinois National Guard, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott volunteered 400 of his state’s troops to be deployed to other states at Trump’s discretion.

Even with Abbott’s cooperation, Illinois argues the deployment of Texas assets to Chicago would be ” in excess of constitutional and statutory authority.”

“There is no insurrection in Illinois,” the lawsuit states. “There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

Federal law enforcement officers and protesters clashed outside an ICE detention facility in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday night in the wake of a federal judge’s ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to the city.

According to video, agents wearing tactical gear – labeled as police, Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security – deployed gas canisters and stood face-to-face with demonstrators who were shouting and taunting the officers with obscenities and vulgar gestures.

Portland protesters clash with federal agents

00:50

Many of the protesters wore gas masks, and at least one protester was carried off handcuffed by three federal agents.

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement there were two arrests made on Sunday night in the area of the protests. In total, 36 arrests have been made in the South Waterfront area since the nightly protests began in June, police said.

The context: The protests outside the Portland detention facility have been going on since summer. President Donald Trump has used clashes between protesters and law enforcement outside the facility as justification for deploying the National Guard to protect federal agents at the facility, and to stop the “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” he said.

CNN has reached out to ICE and DHS for comment on Sunday night’s activity and number of arrests made.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order Monday prohibiting ICE and other federal agencies from using city property for immigration enforcement.

Johnson said the order is aimed at “reining in this out-of-control administration.” The city also joined the state of Illinois Monday in a lawsuit against Trump’s deployment of the National Guard.

Johnson’s order bars federal agents from using city-owned property for federal immigration operations and encourages local businesses and city organizations to safeguard individual rights, his office said.

“Private establishments can partner with us to make it clear that private property is private property, that ICE cannot enter establishments without a valid warrant,” Johnson said at a news conference Monday.

Johnson said the city may be forced to take further action in the coming weeks.

President Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to move the military into Chicago and Portland, Oregon, is facing legal challenges on both fronts.

The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional.”

Over the weekend, Trump authorized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago to “protect federal officers and assets.” Another 400 members of the Texas National Guard may be deployed there with the cooperation of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to help protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June was blocked by a federal judge.

Judge Karin Immergut, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2019, issued an order Saturday preventing the Oregon National Guard from being federalized for the operation.

Immergut ordered the next day that no Guardsmen from any state could be deployed in Oregon for at least two weeks while she considers the case.

The decision was issued after the Trump administration tried an end-around of the original order by deploying federalized troops from the California National Guard to Portland on Sunday, which led to the state of California joining the lawsuit.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.

Meanwhile, state leaders vowed to continue fighting the decision in court.

“Illinois is taking the Trump Administration to court for their unlawful and unconstitutional deployment of military troops to our state,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said on X Monday, thanking the state’s attorney general for “helping defend the rule of law.”

The state’s lawsuit argues that the Trump administration has not provided a legitimate legal explanation for its deployment of the troops, “and none exists,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement released by his office.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” Raoul said in the statement.

Over the weekend, an American woman was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago, according to the Department of Homeland Security and a charging complaint.

The complaint states that on Saturday, Marimar Martinez and a “convoy” of other civilian vehicles followed a CBP vehicle before “driving into and striking” it.

A CBP agent then got out of his car and fired at Martinez five times. DHS described the shots as “defensive” and said the woman was armed “with a semi-automatic weapon,” although the complaint does not state that she was armed or used a weapon. No law enforcement agents were seriously injured in the incident, according to DHS.

Martinez was treated for a gunshot wound at a hospital and released. She is now in FBI custody, according to DHS.

CNN has reached out to Martinez’ attorney for comment.

Martinez isn’t the first driver to be shot by federal agents during intensified immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In September, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who worked as a cook, after a traffic stop. DHS said he resisted arrest and dragged an officer with his vehicle.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-06t053210z-1296236702-rc256haohtzw-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-portland.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-06 14:01:31.479748

No reply. Another knock; nothing. Then Herrera walked to the side of the building, where he saw what he said were two guards behind the facility’s fence. He asked them if they knew anything about his client, Willian Giménez González, who had been taken by ICE that morning in Little Village, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Chicago. According to Herrera, ICE agents stopped Giménez González while he was driving with his wife to get a haircut. They took him away and left his wife, who can’t drive, alone in the car.

The guards listened to Herrera for a moment, then walked away, one of them throwing up a hand as if to say: “Who cares?”

More from Emma Janssen

Herrera left the facility that day with no idea where Giménez González was being held. The next morning, he returned to Broadview with elected officials, other advocates, and Giménez González’s wife to hold a press conference demanding information from ICE. At the end of the press conference, Giménez González’s wife received a phone call from her husband. He confirmed that he was being held in Broadview, just behind the building’s boarded-up windows and chain-link fence.

“His wife handed me the phone. I was talking to him, and his tone changed, and someone asked him who he was talking to,” Herrera said. “And he said, ‘a lawyer.’ And then he told me later that he was made to get off the phone.”

After the press conference, Herrera went home to file a writ of habeas corpus for Giménez González, a legal mechanism that would force a court to re-evaluate Giménez González’s detention and provide a clear justification for it. He filed the petition at midnight, and went to bed.

At 8 the next morning, Giménez González’s wife called Herrera and told him that ICE had transferred her husband out of state. That move nullified Herrera’s legal action. “Because he was in another state at the time that I filed the habeas petition, it couldn’t be heard in Illinois, and the judge just sort of waved it away and transferred it to where he’s being held,” Herrera explained. “I’m not going to talk about where he is [now], because one of the things I’m concerned about is him being moved again.”

HERRERA AND GIMÉNEZ GONZÁLEZ’S EXPERIENCE is increasingly common under ICE’s current regime. It’s not just happening in Chicago, either. Attorneys in New York and Los Angeles told the Prospect similar stories to Herrera’s, outlining how ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.

Only 23 percent of defendants in immigration court have an attorney in court to represent them. Unlike in criminal courts, defendants in immigration court are not entitled to representation. But even those who do have attorneys are struggling to connect with them.

A data investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that so far this year, 12 percent of ICE detainees have been transferred four or more times. That’s double the number relative to last year.

ICE has a number of stated reasons for these transfers, attorneys told me. Sometimes, the agency says it’s a matter of space. Due to pressure from the administration, ICE is working to meet aggressive arrest quotas, leading to inhumane crowding in their detention facilities.

In Illinois, a well-intentioned law has played into ICE’s hands, giving the agency an excuse to transfer detainees out of state. In 2021, the state passed the Illinois Way Forward Act, which ended immigration detention in the state. When ICE arrests people in Illinois, they are processed at the facility in Broadview and then quickly transferred to facilities in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Kentucky.

“It has functionally meant … that when a person is arrested in Illinois, the government can justify taking them hundreds of miles from their family,” Herrera said of the law.

ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate detainees from both their families and their lawyers.

He said that in court, government lawyers used the law to explain why Giménez González was transferred out of state so quickly. But Herrera pointed to local reporting that says some detainees are held in Illinois’s Broadview facility for as many as five days. That leads him to believe that Giménez González’s transfer was retaliatory, or for the express purpose of keeping him away from his advocates.

Melissa Chua, who leads the Immigration Protection Unit of the New York Legal Assistance Group, said that it’s hard to know exactly why ICE moves its detainees, but that the results are clear.

“The outcome is that it is immensely cruel, and that people who actually do have rights are being strongly pressured to give them up,” Chua said.

New York has a universal defender system, which means that detainees are entitled to representation when they are within the state. But when ICE transfers detainees out of state, they lose that right. “[ICE is] not just isolating them emotionally, but taking them practically away from places where they would have had counsel,” Chua said.

These transfers then lead to a bureaucratic hellscape for those who have been arrested, their families, and their lawyers.

Chua described one client who was moved between five different facilities within the span of eight days. Because of how quickly he was being moved and inaccuracies in ICE’s detainee tracking database, her team was unable to speak with the detainee ahead of the briefing on his habeas case. They kept setting up calls, only to find out that he had been moved to an entirely different facility. “We weren’t able to even confirm that he wanted representation, because we couldn’t even speak to him,” she said.

A CHANGE OF FACILITY BRINGS a host of logistical issues. “It’s never straightforward,” said Ming Tanigawa-Lau, a staff attorney at Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles. “Every place has a different way of requesting a meeting, rules about how far in advance you have to request it, who to contact, what hours they can receive calls at.”

The confusion often means lawyers simply can’t meet with their clients—amounting to a lack of access to counsel. “Maybe if the systems that they had set up were functional, it would be acceptable,” Tanigawa-Lau said, referring to the phone, email, and meeting systems she and other attorneys are navigating. “They’re telling the attorneys that we all have this kind of access. But in practice, it doesn’t work.”

What’s more, ICE detention facilities don’t have a system that allows lawyers to remotely share documents with their clients, or vice versa. That means that lawyers and clients need to meet in person to share and review documents, which becomes complicated when clients are moved out of state and meetings are difficult to schedule.

Immigration attorneys can practice in any state, so having a client transferred out of state doesn’t necessarily mean their connection is severed. But in practice, attorneys told me, their inability to speak to their clients, review legal documents with them, and travel to appear in court functionally means they can’t represent their clients—or, at least, makes it much harder to.

Many immigration judges require clients and attorneys to appear in court in person, rather than virtually over video call. Tanigawa-Lau has represented clients virtually after they had been transferred to a different state, but her colleagues have had to fly out to appear in court. Chua said her team couldn’t represent a client who was transferred from New York to Arizona.

ICE is supposed to notify attorneys when they transfer their clients, Tanigawa-Lau says, but in practice the agency doesn’t. Sometimes, she won’t even know that ICE has transferred her client until she gets a call from their family informing her. That’s what happened in the case of Willian Giménez González in Chicago.

Keeping in touch with clients in other states is a major hurdle. Tanigawa-Lau described being on hold for over 30 minutes just to leave a message for a client, waiting days to schedule a meeting, and having to drive two hours to meet in person at the nearest detention facility to her in Los Angeles.

“One time I had to set up a call for a client on a Monday, and when I got there … I found out that he was actually deported the Saturday before,” she said.

CHUA, IN NEW YORK, IS DEEPLY CONCERNED that this lack of due process is leading to illegal and immoral deportations. Though she gave the caveat that she doesn’t have a specific example, she told me she’s almost certain that ICE has deported U.S. citizens who simply weren’t able to assert their rights without access to a lawyer and their community.

The stakes of ICE detentions and transfers seem higher today than they’ve ever been, due to recent legal decisions that have amped up the cruelty at ICE facilities. Just a month ago, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that anyone who enters the country without inspection doesn’t qualify for bond.

“So, they’re not only moving people hundreds of miles away,” Herrera explained, “but those people can’t get out at all. It’s a really punitive and desperate situation for them.” On top of that, the government’s quotas for arrests mean that detention facilities are inhumanely crowded. Chua said that New York’s 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration court that’s been a highly public site of ICE cruelty, has just four cells where up to 70 people have been held at the same time.

“Because of … the denial of access to counsel, there really aren’t any safeguards or stopgaps that keep someone from being moved or held,” Herrera said. “Everything we worry about when a person is in jail—all bets are off once you don’t have access to a lawyer.”

All told, ICE’s practices of transfers, isolation, and overcrowding amount to a desperate situation where due process rights are too easily ignored. “To me, it seems like cruelty is the point,” Chua said.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23639/download/Janssen-ICE%20Chicago%20100625.jpg?cb=122099bf79dc3718f22072d6839cbf77&w=1024,N,,2025-10-06 14:58:01.142461

The DOJ attorneys wrote that the detainees at the Everglades facility have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.","U.S. government lawyers say that detainees at the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" likely include people who have never been in removal proceedings, which is a direct contradiction to what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been saying since it opened in July.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice made that admission Thursday in a court filing arguing that the detainees at the facility in the Everglades wilderness don't have enough in common to be certified as a class in a lawsuit over whether they're getting proper access to attorneys.

A removal proceeding is a legal process initiated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to determine if someone should be deported from the United States.

The DOJ attorneys wrote that the detainees at the Everglades facility have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

""The proposed class includes all detainees at Alligator Alcatraz, a facility that houses detainees in all stages of immigration processing — presumably including those who have never been in removal proceedings, those who will be placed into removal proceedings, those who are already subject to final orders of removal, those subject to expedited removal, and those detained for the purpose of facilitation removal from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal,"" they wrote.

Since the facility opened, DeSantis has been saying publicly that each detainee has gone through the process of determining that they can't legally be in the United States.

During a July 25 news conference outside the detention center, DeSantis said, ""Everybody here is already on a final removal order.""

""They have been ordered to be removed from the country,"" he added.

At a July 29 speech before a conference of the Florida Sheriffs Association, the Republican governor said, ""The people that are going to the Alligator Alcatraz are illegally in the country. They've all already been given a final order of removal.""

He added, ""So, if you have an order to be removed, what is the possible objection to the federal government enforcing that removal order?""

DeSantis' press office didn't respond Monday morning to an email seeking comment.

The court filing by the DOJ attorneys was made in a lawsuit in which civil rights groups allege the facility's detainees have been denied proper access to attorneys in violation of their constitutional rights. The civil rights groups on Thursday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for a preliminary injunction that would establish stronger protections for detainees to meet with attorneys privately and share documents confidentially.

The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over the detention center, which was hastily built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.

A federal judge in Miami ordered in August that the facility must wind down operations within two months, agreeing with environmental groups that the remote airstrip site wasn't given a proper environmental review before it was converted into an immigration detention center. But operations continued after the judge's preliminary injunction was put on hold in early September by an appellate court panel. At one point, the facility held more than 900 detainees, but most of them were transferred after the initial injunction. It wasn't clear on Monday how many detainees were at the center, which was built to hold 3,000 people.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/09/4f94c8f2-61a1-4810-bac5-23d300451899/thumbnail/1200x630/2dc6911eede1c9c8f15f4f5c7fd1e64b/ap25193643742990.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 14:01:38.003245

“We will not let Trump get away with waging a war on the American people. Not in Chicago. Not anywhere. Not now. Not ever.”

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, names the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Newspaper Guild, NABET-CWA Local 54041, the Illinois Press Association, and several individual journalists as plaintiffs. They allege that federal officers, acting under the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” targeted members of the press with rubber bullets, pepper balls, tear gas, flash grenades, and arbitrary arrests at demonstrations outside ICE’s Broadview.

“Federal agents have repeatedly fired less-lethal munitions directly at clearly identifiable members of the press,” the complaint states, describing what it calls a coordinated effort to “silence coverage of federal misconduct”.

Among those named as victims:

Raven Geary, a local reporter struck in the face with a pepper ball while taking a photograph, despite wearing a helmet marked “PRESS.”

Charles Thrush, a DePaul journalism student on assignment for Block Club Chicago, who was shot in the hand while filming.

Stephen Held, co-founder of Unraveled Press, tackled, handcuffed, and detained after documenting an arrest—while displaying multiple press credentials.

A CBS Chicago reporter who was attacked in her car when a federal officer fired pepper balls into her vehicle.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, seeking injunctive relief to bar federal agents from further violence against journalists, protesters, and clergy who have gathered daily at Broadview in opposition to stepped-up deportations.

The complaint also ties the violence to high-level directives from President Donald Trump, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and other federal officials, accusing them of explicitly encouraging officers to “hammer” demonstrators and redefine protest zones as “free arrest zones.” It cites public comments by Trump labeling reporters “the enemy of the American people” and directing agents to suppress dissent in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.

Local leaders including Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have denounced the federal deployment as an unnecessary occupation. Broadview’s mayor warned that relentless use of tear gas has endangered village residents and first responders.

The lawsuit mirrors similar litigation in Los Angeles, where the L.A. Press Club won a temporary injunction limiting federal agents’ use of crowd-control weapons against reporters and peaceful demonstrators earlier this year. Plaintiffs in Chicago now hope for comparable protections.

“Journalists should not have to choose between their safety and their duty to inform the public,” the plaintiffs argue. “This is about protecting the First Amendment at its breaking point.”

While awaiting a retrial would delay final resolution, the vote switch here will allow the defendants to seek prompt review in New York’s highest court, and the liability judgment will remain while they do that. Allowing a judgment of liability to persist in the face of majority opposition is problematic.

Sparing the usual litany of ""stare decisis"" factors, Justice Clarence Thomas offered a simple formula for the amount of deferential weight he gives a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court: how much he agrees with it.

It’s just the latest ICE-tracking initiative to be pulled by tech platforms in the past few days.

A Padlet customer service representative told Celeste, one of the project’s creators, that the map “was trashed due to violations of our Content Policy,” without specifying which policy was violated. Celeste has not disclosed her last name for safety reasons.

But days earlier, the right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had tweeted at Padlet’s CEO about the project.

“Are you aware that @padlet is being used by radical left wing domestic terrorists, illegal aliens and their supporters to obstruct law enforcement operations and harass ICE agents?” she wrote, “PADLET’s Content Policy clearly notes that harassment, stalking, privacy violations, inciting violence, and any other unlawful activity are not on the platform.”

In the same thread, Loomer claimed responsibility for the removal of several similar apps, including ICEBlock, from Apple’s and Google’s app stores last week.

Loomer’s remarks echo statements made by officials at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security claiming that ICE-tracking projects are responsible for a “1000%” increase in assaults on ICE agents.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has described “violence” against ICE agents as “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxxing them, it’s videotaping them where they’re at when they’re out on operations,” while the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, has indicated that the department “will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

Transparency or doxxing?

Celeste started People over Papers in January, after connecting with other TikTok creators who were also sharing information about ICE raids in their communities. In the 10 months since, it has received over 19 million unique visitors and has been averaging between 200,000 and 300,000 users per day.

She came up with the idea of mapping the raids “to inform people of what is happening in their communities” and says the project is “documenting history and gathering information about something that will likely be looked back on as an extremely dark time.”

It is among a number of volunteer-led efforts, including the ICEBlock app that was removed from app stores last week and the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network, that map anonymous reports about immigration enforcement agents conducting raids.

The maps play an important role in “offer[ing] protection, solidarity, and survival strategies in hostile territory,” Allissa Richardson, a scholar at the University of Southern California who studies how marginalized communities use social media, told MIT Technology Review this summer. They serve as “modern-day Green Books for immigrant communities,” she said. “Just as Black travelers once used the Green Book to navigate safely through a landscape of racial terror, these digital tools help Latine families move through spaces marked by surveillance and risk.”

Pressuring technology platforms to remove the maps is just one part of the administration’s strategy to stop efforts to track ICE or identify its masked agents conducting raids. In early September, DHS subpoenaed Meta for the personal information of users behind the Instagram accounts of the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network and a number of other nonprofit organizations and rapid response networks; the subpoena has been temporarily blocked pending a court hearing.

At least one person has allegedly lost her job in connection to these apps. Carolyn Feinstein, whose husband ran the ICEBlock app, was terminated from her job with the Department of Justice over the summer, which she says was in retaliation for her husband’s work.

“Trying to blunt these efforts to hold federal officers accountable” has the effect of “chilling speech and activism,” says David Greene, the director of civil liberties at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He says that identifying agents does not count as doxxing, because “the idea that law enforcement would be masked and and therefore unaccountable to the people they are serving is really anathema to American values.”

“Saying the doxxing itself is an act of violence would require a different definition of violence than the one we've traditionally used in regards to legal issues,” says Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies threats to public officials.

For its part, the People over Papers map was back online six hours after it was removed from Padlet—this time on its own website, which Celeste’s team has been working on since May and had planned to launch next week.

Celeste says she isn’t cowed: “I am personally super stubborn. The more someone tells me I can’t do something, the more I want to do it.”

Besides, “if this information isn't posted on our platform, it will be posted on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and any other social media platform,” she says. “People will continue to inform each other one way or another.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25278024170174.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 12:57:43.877277

Hayes",,,,,https://michiganadvance.com/2025/10/06/immigration-isnt-the-crime-story-were-being-told/,"After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community.
Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city.
This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime.
These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants.
Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.","Drive through Hamtramck today and you’ll see a city that has found new life. After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community. Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city. Small businesses line the streets, families walk to school and the community has regained much of the vitality it had lost.

This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime. In April, when a Michigan lawmaker characterized immigrants as “violent gangbangers, perverts, scammers and all sorts of other criminals,” he was speaking to widely held but unsupported concerns following a surge in immigration. So, what does the evidence actually show?

Consider what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) own data tells us. According to ICE’s September 2025 records from Michigan, the overwhelming majority of those detained, 86%, are classified as having “No ICE Threat Level,” with no prior criminal convictions. Decades of research have actually found that people who are undocumented are more than 30% less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.

What we’re seeing in Hamtramck reflects a broader trend documented across the country, where immigrant communities often contribute to neighborhood stability rather than undermining it. In fact, of the top 10 Michigan cities with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents, the majority had lower than average property crime and violent crime given both their size and poverty levels.

Why would this be? Laurence Benenson, policy liaison at the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force — a group primarily composed of police officers — observes that immigration is highly self-selective; the people willing to uproot their lives are typically motivated, law-abiding individuals, not criminals looking to exploit the system. This explains why crime rates often drop as immigrants move into an area.

Yet media coverage tells a dramatically altered story. Between 2022 and 2024, Fox News aired nearly 1,000 segments on “migrant crime,” with coverage jumping 880% in early 2024. These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants. At the same time, claims that the U.S. is under invasion by transnational Latin American gangs, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, have been used to justify the use of the Alien Enemies Act, enabling deportations without due process.

But Maya Barak, who teaches criminology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and specifically studied transnational Latin American gangs like MS-13, says these groups tend to be concentrated on the coasts and aren’t considered a significant public safety threat in Michigan. She adds that most gang violence is between and among rivals and tends not to extend into the community, where they don’t have a foothold.

Under the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, with H.R.1 transforming ICE into the highest-funded domestic enforcement agency, arrests have increased 150% in Michigan. Raids can now proceed at schools, churches and hospitals. Six Michigan cities and counties have signed potentially costly 287(g) agreements, deputizing local law enforcement for immigration duties and paving the way for mass deportation.

This enforcement environment undermines public safety. According to Barak, it pushes people underground out of fear, endangering community trust and limiting law enforcement. Current policies are terrorizing immigrant communities, preventing them from contacting emergency services, which are often intertwined with local police, discouraging life-saving calls. Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Immigrant-Heritage-Month.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:38.429748

Welcome to what captivates, haunts, inspires, and surprises me every week in the world of legal ethics.

Happy First Monday! On the first Monday of each month, you get a longer version of the Roundup with the headlines plus reading recommendations, job postings, events, and many other features. The first Monday in October is extra special because it is also the opening day for the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2025 Term.

In 2010, I wrote a law review article called “The Supreme Court’s Increased Attention to the Law of Lawyering: Mere Coincidence or Something More?” I described what has turned out to be the high-water mark for cases involving legal ethics issues taken up by the Supreme Court in a particular term. There were seventeen — seventeen! — such cases during the 2009 Term. You can read the full article here if you want to know more about the cases from the 2009 Term.

But what about the Supreme Court’s docket for the upcoming term? So far we have only one. But to be fair the Court has only granted cert to a few dozen cases to date. I’ll be keeping an eye out. For now, here’s an overview of Villarreal v. Texas, which will be argued today. Along with several other legal ethics scholars, I joined an amicus brief filed in this case. At issue is whether a trial court violates a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by prohibiting the defendant and his lawyer from discussing testimony during an overnight recess. We argue that a ban on discussions like this jeopardizes the lawyer’s compliance with core professional responsibilities and undermines attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality. Read more and download the amicus brief here.

In totally-unrelated-to-legal-ethics news, I’ve been listening nonstop to the newly-released album from Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl (reviewed here by The New York Times – gift link). At the moment, my favorite tracks are CANCELLED! and Opalite. Whatever you think of her music, she always leaves her fans with something to look forward to. I hope that’s what I’m doing here for legal ethics fans each week!

Now, let’s get started with the headlines. Don’t forget to keep scrolling down to the very end for all the “First Monday” extra features. Enjoy!

Highlights from the Past Week – Top Ten Headlines

#1 “Texas Plans to End ABA’s Role in State’s Law School Oversight.” From Reuters: “The Supreme Court of Texas said in an order on Friday that it ‘is of the tentative opinion that the ABA should no longer have the final say’ on whether a law school’s alumni can sit for the Texas Bar or be licensed….University of Houston law dean Leonard Baynes told Reuters on Monday that he was pleased the court showed commitment to law degree portability and avoiding onerous requirements on law schools. But Baynes said the ‘order creates uncertainty for legal education in the backdrop of an already chaotic world of higher education.’” Read more here.

#2 “The Justice Department Seeks Information on the Georgia D.A. Who Prosecuted Trump.” From the New York Times: “The Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for records related to the travel history of Fani T. Willis, the Georgia district attorney who charged President Trump in a sweeping election interference case, according to a federal grand jury subpoena reviewed by The New York Times. The scope of the investigation is not yet clear. Also unclear is whether Ms. Willis is the target of the inquiry and whether she will ultimately face charges. Grand jury proceedings are secretive by law. But the document reviewed by The Times is an indication that the Justice Department under President Trump may be investigating another one of his old foes.” Read more here.

#3 “Michigan Justices Issue Scaled-Back Judicial Anti-Bias Rule.” From Bloomberg Law: “The Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday tweaked a conduct rule barring judges from exhibiting bias or harassing those in their courtrooms, but didn’t go as far as a proposal from earlier this year. The rule previously said a judge ‘should’ treat everyone fairly and respectfully, ‘without regard to a person’s race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic.’ The new one, which goes into effect Jan. 1, says a judge must perform their duties ‘without bias or prejudice.’ It changes ‘should’ to ‘shall,’ and says they ‘shall not intentionally or recklessly, in the performance of judicial duties, manifest bias or prejudice’.” Read more here.

#4 “What Ethics Rules Say On Atty Discipline For Online Speech.” From the Law360: “Though law firms are free to discipline employees for their online commentary about Charlie Kirk or other social media activity, saying crude or insensitive things on the internet generally doesn’t subject attorneys to professional discipline under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, says Stacie H. Rosenzweig at Halling & Cayo.” Read more here.

#5 “Ethics Opinion 1286: Requesting Former Clients to Write Google Reviews.” From the New York State Bar Association: “A lawyer may ask a former client to write a Google review of the lawyer’s services, and may offer the former client a nominal gift for doing so, provided the lawyer does not draft the Google review for the client or condition the gift on the content of the review. The lawyer may not use the former client’s confidential information to the disadvantage of the former client.” Read more here.

# 6 “Supreme Court Ethics Issues Trace to John Roberts’ ‘Original Sin,’ New Book Alleges.” From the Rolling Stone: “When he was pitching himself to George W. Bush for a seat on the highest court in the land, John Roberts famously declared that judges should be like ‘umpires,’ making calls but never stepping up to the plate for either team. Bush liked the line so much he didn’t just give Roberts a seat on the Supreme Court, he installed him as chief justice — the youngest person to hold that job in almost 200 years. A new book, Without Precedent — an excerpt of which has been shared exclusively with Rolling Stone — suggests another powerful reason why Bush may have felt such extraordinary confidence appointing Roberts to the most powerful position in the U.S. judiciary. At the time that Roberts was auditioning for the job, he was also presiding over a critical case to which the Bush administration was a party — and rather than acting as an ump in that case, author Lisa Graves suggests, Roberts was practically pinch-hitting for Bush and his cronies.” Read more here.

#7 “Using Military Lawyers as Immigration Judges is Ill-Advised and Potentially Illegal.” From the Brennan Center for Justice: “The Trump administration’s reported authorization of 600 military lawyers to act as temporary immigration judges would deprive immigrants of a fair hearing and further erode the line between the military and civilian government. This is true regardless of the professionalism of the military lawyers. Immigration judges are specially trained administrative judges in the Department of Justice who oversee deportation hearings. … In addition, ethical rules are fundamental to the rule of law, but the legal and ethical obligations of military lawyers and immigration judges are in tension.” Read more here.

#8 “Update to ‘Conflict U.’: Some Judges Are Recusing Due to a University Conflict.” From Fix the Court: “In July, Fix the Court released a report called Conflict U. that identified 24 federal judges who did not recuse in six dozen cases involving the universities where they also serve as law school instructors. This practice raises clear conflict-of-interest concerns, despite being sanctioned by judiciary policy. The report urges reforms to strengthen recusal practices and restore public trust in judicial ethics. This past month, Fix the Court conducted follow-up research on this issue, and what we found was somewhat surprising: several judges with adjunct positions at law schools are, in fact, choosing to recuse when the law schools’ parent universities find themselves in their courtrooms.” Read more here.

#9 “Law, Layers and the Battle Against Antisemitism.” From Eli Wald (Denver) in JOTWELL reviewing Antisemitism and the Law by Robert Katz: “According to the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer is ‘a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. As Deborah Rhode has astutely pointed out, however, lawyers’ duties as public citizens have long been more of a rhetorical ploy than an actual commitment, in need of elaboration and exposition. In the twenty-first century, lawyers have been forced to come to terms with their asserted role as public citizens in the face of the #MeToo and the Black Lives Matter movements, reform calls for the deregulation of the legal profession designed to increase access to legal services for those who cannot afford to pay for them, and attacks on the rule of law. Professor Robert Katz’ new casebook, Antisemitism and the Law, constitutes an important contribution sure to help those aiming to understand the obligations of lawyers to pursue justice and combat discrimination.” Read more here.

#10 “Dealing with Social Media & Public Comment: Legal Ethics Lessons for Corporate Counsel.” From JD Supra: “Social media can turn small moments into corporate crises overnight. For in-house counsel, the ethical challenges are particularly complex: protecting confidential information, addressing employee conduct, and managing public backlash when private behavior goes viral. … The Oklahoma and Texas Rules of Professional Conduct frame the lawyer’s obligations when social media collides with the workplace.” Read more here.

“Legal Insurance and Its Limits” by Nora Freeman Engstrom (Stanford). From the abstract:

Courts are buckling under the weight of a staggering access-to-justice crisis. In three-quarters of cases, at least one side lacks a lawyer, default judgments are on the rise, and most Americans with valid claims never take legal action. The situation is dire, and it understandably has policymakers casting about for a fix. On the menu are a range of uncontroversial reform ideas, such as expanding legal aid, supporting system simplification, and promoting pro bono. But it is increasingly clear that those measures—even if accomplished—would not make a dent in the problem. Attention is thus turning to other reform ideas, such as relaxing unauthorized practice of law (UPL) rules and scrapping Model Rule 5.4(d), the provision that prevents nonlawyers from even partially owning entities that deliver legal services. Both reforms are promising. But both would dilute the longstanding lawyers’ monopoly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the bar is fighting these reforms tooth-and-nail.

Into this roiling landscape, some now have a new idea: legal insurance. They suggest that legal insurance is the way to expand access to justice for middle and working-class Americans. Reformers are also quick to point out that—unlike a relaxation of UPL restrictions or the abolition of Rule 5.4(d)—legal insurance stands to benefit lawyers.

We have seen this play before. In the 1970s, the bar seized on legal insurance as a solution to what was then seen as an urgent access-to-justice crisis afflicting the middle-class. … This Article recovers the lost history of the country’s first experiment with legal insurance. In so doing, it seeks to forestall another false start. In addition, by drawing on a range of disciplines—including insurance law (particularly insights concerning moral hazard and adverse selection), behavioral economics, legal ethics, and the legal profession—this Article explains why the legal insurance idea floundered, and seems destined to flounder, going forward.

“Interoperable Legal AI for Access to Justice” by Drew Simshaw (UNLV). From the abstract:

The access-to-justice gap is growing, affecting individuals with both civil and criminal needs in the United States. Though these challenges are multifaceted, procedural barriers in the U.S. legal system can often inhibit access-to-justice efforts. The resulting inequities undermine fairness for those interacting with courts and jeopardize the legitimacy of the broader legal system. Legal technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its potential to combat these challenges on three access-to-justice fronts that are often conceptualized in isolation: a consumer (i.e., self-help) front, a legal-service-provider front, and a court front. Progress on each of these fronts is apparent, though not at the pace or scale necessary to make meaningful inroads into closing the justice gap nationwide. The time has come to appreciate that, although progress on all three fronts is necessary for closing the justice gap and maximizing fairness, it is insufficient if there is not also some level of shared commitment and coordination across – and not just within – all fronts. This Essay argues that technological and procedural legal interoperability – that is, widespread consistency in technology design and related processes – should be at the forefront of these efforts, particularly as they relate to artificial intelligence. Further, although the consumer and legal-services fronts remain critically important, courts should be recognized as the necessary drivers in achieving this interoperable legal AI.

PITTSBURGH, PA – OCTOBER 6, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Federal Law Enforcement, Congresswoman Shontel Brown (OH-11), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) led a letter raising urgent concerns over reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has activated a contract with Paragon Solutions, a foreign spyware company whose surveillance product ""Graphite"" has the ability to covertly access private data on Americans’ cell phones without their knowledge or consent.

In the letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers warn that ICE’s potential use of Graphite, which employs “zero-click” exploits to access encrypted messages, photos, and real-time location data, poses a serious threat to civil liberties, privacy, and constitutional protections—all of which have been undermined under the Trump Administration.

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

The letter references alarming reports that Paragon spyware has already been used to target journalists and human rights advocates in Europe. It also invokes Supreme Court rulings — Riley v. California (2014) and Carpenter v. United States (2018) — which affirmed the need for a warrant before law enforcement can access cell phone content or location data.

In light of potential constitutional violations, the Members are demanding transparency and oversight. Specifically, they are requesting:

All communications and documents discussing ICE’s use of spyware, including but not limited to Paragon Solutions software like Graphite;

All communications and documents regarding the legality of and legal justification for using spyware or mass electronic surveillance for immigration enforcement;

A comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States; and

All communications and documents regarding the legality of using spyware against individuals residing within the United States given Executive Order 14093.

“Allowing ICE access to spyware that can be used to easily track and monitor the public—including those vocally opposed to governmental overreach— threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech...[and] raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S,” the letter concludes.

The Members of Congress are seeking a full response from DHS by October 14, 2025.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks out

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area.
Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement.
A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities’ restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

Millions spent on the 30-second ads

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

Local police can’t compete with ICE promises

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

JB Pritzker said Sunday night.

The Democrat blasted Trump’s “invasion” hours after the president mobilized 300 California National Guard members to Portland, where unrest has raged for over 100 consecutive days outside an immigration detention center — a scene that has been playing out in Chicago since September.

Pritzker said the plan defies his wishes, adding that federal officials haven’t reached out to coordinate or discuss the deployment.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” the governor said in a post on X, encouraging “every American to speak up and help stop this madness.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will not involve sending in another state’s military troops. I call on [Texas] Governor [Greg] Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to coordinate.”

Pritzker condemned Trump for wanting to send active-duty troops to a “sovereign state” without permission, accusing the president of using the National Guard as “political props.”

The White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

A violent wave of anti-ICE protests has intensified in the Windy City since US Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative aimed at targeting criminal illegal immigrants who feds say flocked to Chicago to seek protection under the state’s “sanctuary policies.”

The immigration enforcement operation has drawn pushback from Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other prominent local Democrats.

But despite their objections, demonstrations have escalated in recent days, with protesters using vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner one day earlier this week.

US Border Patrol agents patrolling Chicago’s South Side on Saturday also opened fire and wounded a woman — later found to be armed — after an angry mob attempted to attack the federal officers.

The agents were located about 15 miles from an ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, a site that’s been a hotbed of civil unrest, when the ambush began.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem — who touched down in Illinois Friday morning — called Chicago a “war zone” during an interview Sunday with “Fox & Friends Weekend.”

Noem also alleged that Chicago has been blocking federal law enforcement, including Border Patrol and ICE officers, from using public restrooms in the city.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Illinois.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:04.453590

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.
Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).
Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.
Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.","The researchers focused on immigrant detention centers, which experts say are primarily used to hold immigrants and ensure they make their court hearings and check-ins — not to punish them for immigration violations.

Driving the news: Nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers nationwide between April 2024 and August 2025, per new data provided exclusively to Axios.

Researchers detailed an increase in solitary confinement placements and, for some populations, weeks-long isolation periods, in a recent report that focused on data between April 2024 and May 2025.

The report, which relies on ICE's data collections, didn't show the duration of solitary confinement placements for all detainees, just for those labeled as ""vulnerable,"" like those with mental health issues.

Zoom in: Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" who make up one-fifth of detainees between April 2024 and May, were placed in solitary confinement for an average of 38 days in the first three months of 2025.

In 2021, the average duration was 14 days, per the report.

ICE's own directives suggest using solitary confinement on people with mental health conditions only as a last resort.

This often happened in state and county jails contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold detainees.

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.

By the numbers: The report found that Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, had the highest number of people isolated (1,905) through May.

Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).

What they're saying: ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" says Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that uses medicine to advocate against human rights violations.

Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.

ICE didn't respond to several emails from Axios seeking comment.

The other side: Some jails and prisons, like in Massachusetts, say they have shifted away from solitary confinement and instead practice ""administrative segregation,"" which involves separating detainees believed to pose a threat to safety, property or correctional operations.

Massachusetts officials say segregated detainees regularly interact with staff clinicians and sometimes inmates, and that they have daily access to mental health clinicians.

Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.

What's next: The report urged state and local officials to use their own power to end or reduce the use of solitary confinement in local facilities with ICE contracts.

The report also suggested unplanned facility inspections by local officials and steps to ensure detainees have legal representation, interpreters and due process protections.

The bottom line: ""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people, and these are people who are not imprisoned for criminal activity,"" Zarifi said.",https://images.axios.com/kLIrmxNB88IRcHKWScYhfUNbOLk=/0x9:1300x740/1366x768/2025/10/06/1759756539443.png,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:50.402810

The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation.
After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California.","Hours after California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against the Trump administration Sunday seeking to prevent the president from sending 300 California National guard troops to Portland, Ore., a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order blocking federalized deployment from any state to Oregon.

The order came during an extraordinary Sunday night hearing after Oregon and California attorneys revealed that in addition to trying to send California troops to Oregon, President Trump’s War Secretary, Pete Hegseth, had ordered Texas National Guard members to deploy as well.

Oregon District Court Judge Karin Immergut interrupted Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton repeatedly during the hearing, saying the administration was trying to circumvent an order she issued Saturday temporarily halting the use of Oregon Guard troops in Portland.

She said that she sees the conduct of the Trump administration, and its federalization of 400 Texas National Guard troops, as a “direct contravention of the order that this court issued yesterday.” The Texas National Guard was also slated for Chicago and other locations, a legal document said.

At another point in the hearing she asked, “aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order, which relies on the conditions in Portland, and nothing has changed? Another point in the hearing. “So why is this appropriate?”

Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, argued that the White House was authorized to send in the California National Guard, despite Immergut’s Saturday order, because the California troops were called up under a different Trump memo in June. Immergut dismissed that line of reasoning. “Mr. Hamilton, you are missing the point, because here it’s the conditions on the ground in Oregon that was a basis for my finding” yesterday. And those conditions haven’t changed.

After the 30-minute hearing, which was delayed nearly an hour for technical reasons, Bonta issued a statement applauding Immergut’s ruling.

“The President’s move to deploy the National Guard of one state over the objections of a Governor to another state over the objections of a second is well outside of the norms or practices of any President in recent history.” Bonta wrote. “This fight isn’t over, but today’s rebuke of the President’s illegal actions is a step in the right direction.” This was California 42nd suit against Trump in 36 weeks.

Stephen Miller, a senior White House advisor, condemned the judge’s decision Sunday in a social media post. “A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property.” Federal appeals court judges, including those appointed by Trump, disagree and have ruled that they can review a president’s decisions, but with deference.

He also called the ruling “one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat.”

On Saturday, Immergut temporarily blocked the administration from activating a contingent of the Oregon National Guard to combat what President Donald Trump calls lawless behavior emanating from immigration protests in Portland.

Hegseth responded by calling in California troops. As of Sunday evening, 100 California Guard members had already arrived in Portland.

“The stakes could not be higher,” Bonta said before Sunday’s hearing. “People should understand clearly what is happening here: The president is seeking to deploy the California National Guard as federal military police indefinitely anywhere in the country. He’s not even hiding the ball.”

He and legal representatives for Portland and Oregon sought a temporary halt to the deployment of California troops.

Bonta’s messaging echoes Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said in a statement Sunday morning that: “we will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.”

By Sunday morning 100 California National Guard troops arrived in Portland by plane from Los Angeles, the amended suit says. Hegseth intends to send another 200 California National Guard troops soon, Bonta added.

Trump has characterized Portland and other Democratic-run cities as dangerous, high-crime zones and last week told a gathering of U.S. generals that the military should “use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

Trump’s moves are ‘unique’

In the suit filed Sunday evening, lawyers for California and Oregon argue that the White House is again failing to meet the standards of the federal law that would permit Hegseth to federalize any National Guard troops — Title 10, Section 12406.

It also says that the initial reason for federalizing the California National Guard to Los Angeles is “wholly unrelated” to the Trump administration’s goals in Portland.

Bonta expressed dismay over the shifting reasons to deploy California’s troops. The White House does “not have the carte blanche … to deploy whatever military they want, whenever they want,” he said at the press conference.

The suit also argues that the Trump White House is violating a 19th century federal law prohibiting federal troops from acting as law enforcement.

The dynamic is highly unusual, in no small part because Trump is essentially pulling troops from one state that has opposed his use of the National Guard to another state where political leaders also reject Trump’s moves.

“I don’t think we’ve seen this scenario before, I think it is unique,” Bonta said.

Trump claims he must deploy federalized troops because Portland is under siege by protesters opposing the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

But Immergut, the Oregon judge, ruled Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” enough to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued her decision as part of a temporary restraining order against the federal government after Oregon and city of Portland sued the administration last week.

Protesters there set up “a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials” while others flashed bright lights into the eyes of federal officials driving, Immergut summarized. “These incidents are inexcusable, but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces,” Immergut wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.”

The Trump administration on Saturday appealed that decision to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

What’s likely new

Immergut’s order over the weekend was narrow, said Loren Voss, a fellow at the legal affairs publication Lawfare who’s taught classes on domestic deployment of the military. In an interview with CalMatters, Voss said the order specifically blocked Hegseth’s federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard — it wasn’t a restraining order on all National Guard deployments.

“But one of their (Oregon’s) big arguments, and one that judge Immergut found persuasive, was a diversion of their National Guard members from state responsibilities, right, which would not apply here,” Voss said.

She expects several overlapping legal proceedings to unfold. In addition to Newsom’s vow to sue, the Ninth Circuit may weigh in shortly on Immergut’s Saturday decision in response to the Trump administration’s emergency appeal, which could shape how future legal challenges unfold.

Voss noted that Trump federalized the California National Guard because of protests in Los Angeles, but now they’re being assigned to duties in Portland for a different purpose. “This is an interesting legal question,” she said. “I think there is a good challenge that can be made there.”

Trump sent thousands of troops into L.A.

California sued Trump in June after the president federalized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and 700 Marines to protect federal property and provide support for federal immigration law enforcement officers after protests across Los Angeles County erupted over immigration sweeps.

A district judge, appointed by President Bill Clinton, sided with Newsom by issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump’s use of the National Guard in June. But a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit blocked that decision, giving Trump control of the federal troops again.

The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation. After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California. Those are the troops Hegseth is sending to Oregon. Bonta had already sued to stop that extended deployment before Sunday’s suit.

The Oregon judge’s decision doesn’t conflict with the higher court’s reasons for returning the federal troops to Trump, said Kelly Simon, a legal director at the ACLU of Oregon, during a press conference.

The appeals court said judges can review such military decisions, rejecting an argument by Trump administration lawyers. And while the “courts have to give a substantial deference” to a president’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to a state against the wishes of a governor, the White House still has to make that “determination rooted in fact,” Simon said. “The president’s determination was untethered from the facts.”

The California federal lower court judge also ruled in September that federal troops were used for law enforcement purposes, a violation of a 19th-century law banning the military from such activity.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Judge Charles Breyer. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

He blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the Trump administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:53.480657

The federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and similar state laws cast a wide net that is intended to snare those involved in or those that ""knowingly benefit"" from trafficking. Industries such as agriculture, construction, transportation, technology, banking, hospitality, and others are vulnerable to trafficking claims.

In addition to ""perpetrator liability"" for those directly involved in trafficking, the TVPRA allows victims to pursue civil claims against individuals and entities that benefit from the trafficking. To assert a claim for ""beneficiary liability,"" a plaintiff must allege, and ultimately prove, (1) the defendant knowingly benefitted from (2) participation in a venture (3) that it knew or should have known engaged in trafficking, including forced labor and sex trafficking. Recent examples include:

Filipino migrant workers alleging forced labor and violations of the TVPRA sued CH2M Hill International, Jacob Engineering Group, and related companies that worked with the Qatari government to construct soccer stadiums and facilities as part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank faced civil lawsuits from victims of Jeffrey Epstein for their alleged role in facilitating and profiting from the trafficking.

com, Inc. faces multiple TVPRA lawsuits alleging that it assisted, supported, and facilitated sex trafficking by selling its software tools and providing operational support to Backpage.com.

According to the Human Trafficking Legal Center, the number of TVPRA filings has increased from six in 2004 to 280 in 2024. Unsurprisingly, the increase in TVPRA civil claims has led to an increase in disputes over insurance coverage for such claims.

Two recent decisions add to a growing number of courts concluding that TVPRA claims may trigger coverage under Coverage A (bodily injury and property damage) and/or Coverage B (personal and advertising injury) of a commercial general liability (CGL) policy. In both cases, the court rejected the insurers' arguments that (1) policy exclusions precluded coverage and/or (2) public policy barred coverage.

Courts Find That TVPRA Allegations Trigger Coverage

In Peerless Indemnity Insurance Company, et. al. v. Tilma, Inc., No. 24-492 (U.S.D.C. E.D. VA July 22, 2025), the court dismissed the insurers' lawsuit seeking a declaration that the insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify an insured alleged to have violated the TVPRA. The court concluded that the insurers had a duty to defend and indemnify the insured in the underlying trafficking lawsuit ""because the Policy unambiguously covers the conduct alleged against [the insured]."" Id. at 6. In the underlying lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged she was trafficked, her traffickers used the insured's hotel for their crimes, and that the insured turned a blind eye to the trafficking.

The Peerless court found that Coverage B encompassed the alleged conduct. Like standard CGL policies, the policy at issue in Peerless provided coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries,"" including injuries ""arising out of … false arrest, detention, or imprisonment."" Id. at 7. The Peerless court explained that the underlying complaint alleged the insured ""knew or should have known that [the victim] was being detained"" and that employees ""overheard [the victim] screaming while her trafficker caught her, dragged her back to her hotel room, and beat her following her attempt to escape her trafficker."" Id. The court properly concluded that the complaint's ""know or should have known"" language sounded in negligence, and the allegations alleged detention as defined under Virginia law. Therefore, the complaint alleged ""personal and advertising injury"" covered under the policy.

In Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., et. al., No. 23-02047 (U.S.D.C. N.D. Georgia August 15, 2025), the court concluded that ""Georgia law requires a finding that Plaintiff has a duty to defend the Red Roof Defendants"" in the underlying lawsuit under Coverage A of the policy. Liberty Mutual argued the underlying allegations did not trigger coverage because there were no allegations of ""bodily injury"" caused by an ""occurrence."" Liberty Mutual predicated its position on the definition of ""occurrence"" defined in the policy as ""an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions."" Liberty Mutual pointed to allegations of the insureds' active and intentional participation in the trafficking scheme, arguing that such intentional conduct could not be accidental. The Red Roof Inn defendants, however, argued that whether an event is an accident must be determined from the viewpoint of the insured and whether the insured's conduct was designed to injure the victim. Stated another way, the alleged injury would only not satisfy the ""occurrence"" definition if the insured subjectively intended or expected to cause specific injury to the plaintiff.

The court agreed with the Red Roof Inn defendants, noting that, while the complaint did include allegations of intentional conduct, the complaint also included allegations that the insureds ""should have known"" of the trafficking. The court correctly held that such ""constructive knowledge language sounds in negligence and implies that the Red Roof Defendants did not have the requisite intent to cause [the victim's] alleged bodily injuries."" Id. at 13. The court cited to Georgia law, reasoning that an insurer has a duty to defend if the facts as alleged ""even arguably bring the occurrence with the policy's coverage."" Id. And, because the insureds ""were alleged to be negligent in regard to the TVPRA violations, the Court finds that [Plaintiff's] complaint is arguably covered by the ‘bodily injury from an occurrence' provision of Coverage A.""

Courts Find That Policy Exclusions Do Not Preclude Coverage

Having concluded the allegations triggered coverage, both courts turned to the policy exclusions the insurers argued precluded coverage. Both courts properly found the exclusions inapplicable by focusing on the allegations and conduct of the insured as opposed to those of the traffickers.

In the Peerless matter, the insurer argued that an exclusion precluding coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict personal and advertising injury"" applied. The court disagreed because the underlying complaint did not allege the insured itself sexually trafficked the victim or directed her traffickers to commit their intentional tort. Instead, the complaint alleged the insured's lack of action or lack of knowledge of the trafficking made it liable and such allegations do not ""equate to ‘causing or directing' actions with the knowledge that those actions would violate the rights of"" the victim. Similarly, an exclusion for injuries ""arising out of a criminal act committed by or at the direction of the insured"" was inapplicable because there were no allegations that the insured committed or directed the criminal conduct.

Likewise, the Liberty Mutual court rejected the argument that the Expected or Intended Injury Exclusion, which bars coverage for bodily injury ""expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,"" applied. In analyzing the exclusion, the court noted it must narrowly and strictly construe the provision against the insurer under Georgia law. Given the ""know or should have known"" allegations, the court found that at least some of the allegations did not allege the insureds acted with the intent or expectation of causing bodily injury and, thus, the exclusion did not unambiguously preclude coverage.

Courts Find That Public Policy Does Not Prohibit Coverage for TVPRA Claims

Many states prohibit insurance coverage for criminal acts or intentionally inflicted injuries on public policy grounds. Insurers have sought to extend these public policy prohibitions to human trafficking claims. At least one federal district court did just that, concluding that Pennsylvania's public policy bars coverage for those involved in allegedly enabling or profiting from human trafficking. In Samsung Fire & Marine Ins., Co., (U.S. Branch) v. UFVS Mgmt. Co., LLC, No. CV 18-04365 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2023), the court relied on Pennsylvania's anti-trafficking law, which criminalizes (1) harboring or maintaining a person with reckless disregard to the fact that they will be subject to sex trafficking and (2) knowingly benefitting from such trafficking as evidence of Pennsylvania's overriding public policy against sex trafficking. According to the court, the allegations against the insureds exposed them to independent criminal liability.

On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that deciding the issue would require weighing Pennsylvania's strong presumption of insurance coverage against Pennsylvania's public policy against sex trafficking and, because the court could not predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would rule, it certified the issue to the Supreme Court. Samsung Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (U.S. Branch) v. RI Settlement Tr., No. 23-1988 (3d Cir. Aug. 12, 2024). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted certification, and the case remains pending.

Beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, however, is not limited to criminal conduct and, for defendants that purportedly knowingly benefit from trafficking, plaintiffs often allege conduct that falls short of criminal as demonstrated in the Peerless matter. After ruling that the criminal act exclusion did not apply, the Peerless court addressed the insurers' argument that Virginia public policy prohibits coverage for criminal acts prohibited by the TVPRA. In rejecting this argument, the court explained that Virginia courts prohibit coverage only in cases where the insured acts with specific intent to cause harm. The court further explained that beneficiary liability under the TVPRA does not require specific intent on the part of a beneficiary and there were no such allegations in the underlying complaint.

Liberty Mutual raised the issue of intent in arguing that public policy precludes coverage for the Red Roof Inn defendants, pointing to Georgia law that states it is against public policy to insure against injuries intentionally inflicted. According to Liberty Mutual, because the Red Roof Inn defendants participated in the sex trafficking venture where injuries are often intentionally inflicted, it goes against public policy to provide coverage. The Liberty Mutual court rejected this argument, explaining that ""Georgia's public policy exclusion focuses on whether the injuries were intentionally inflicted, not simply whether the conduct was intentional,"" and there were no allegations that the insureds (as opposed to the traffickers) intended to injure the victims. Additionally, the Liberty Mutual court recognized that the TVPRA does not have a scienter requirement, nor does it require a showing of injurious intent.

The Peerless and Liberty Mutual decisions add to the growing body of case law concluding that TVPRA claims trigger coverage under CGL policies under Coverages A and B, of course depending on the specific allegations and policy language. The decisions also reinforce well-established principles of insurance law, including (1) insurers have a broad duty to defend; (2) exclusionary language must be narrowly and strictly construed against the insurer; and (3) intentional act exclusions focus on the subjective intent of the insured, not the intentional acts of others. Importantly, both courts also recognized that TVPRA beneficiary liability does not require specific intent on the part of the alleged beneficiary, making reliance on public policy difficult where there are allegations the alleged beneficiary acted negligently i.e., ""knew or should have known"" of the trafficking.

There are two fundamental principles each member of the military learns when he or she takes the oath of office: first, that superior orders are presumed to be lawful and must be scrupulously obeyed; and, second, that if there is ever a conflict between orders and the law, the law prevails. Over the past year, these principles have come into sharp focus. America’s military personnel – volunteers all – are increasingly alert to the prospect that they may be asked to prioritize loyalty to an individual over their rights and responsibilities under the law.

In 2024, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that a president is absolutely immune from prosecution for acts within the scope of his core constitutional authority. In the military context, what this could mean is that the other branches of government – Congress and the Judiciary – may not make or enforce any law that would make him criminally liable for any act performed, decision made, or order given in his capacity as commander-in-chief. Although the contours of the Supreme Court’s decision have yet to be fully tested or defined, what is already clear is that – impeachment aside – it effectively places a president above the law and eliminates any legal incentive for him to exercise restraint. This becomes even more dangerous when, as now, a president is ineligible for re-election, since the ballot box does not serve as a check.

The Supreme Court majority’s rationale was that if a president is subject to prosecution for exercising his exclusive constitutional authority – authority widely understood to include at least some aspects of his role as commander-in-chief – he might be “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties.” In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a couple of military examples – “nightmare scenarios” such as staging a military coup or ordering SEAL Team Six to execute a political rival – to illustrate her conviction that, as a result of the majority’s decision, “the President is now a king above the law.”

The majority focused on the president’s authority and prerogatives; the dissenters focused on the potential havoc an unrestrained president might wreak. It’s understandable that no one examined the impact of this decision on military personnel who might be ordered to carry out orders for which a president can no longer be held accountable. Understandable because, other than Justice Samuel Alito (who served on active duty in the Army for three months following his law school graduation) no Justice has any military experience. Unfortunately, by failing to consider the impact of its decision on the military, the Court placed the entire burden of dealing with an unbounded commander-in-chief upon those serving in uniform and other federal employees who are subject to his orders.

When Is an Order Unlawful?

Following the reelection of Donald Trump, much has been written about the military’s obligation to obey lawful orders and right to disobey unlawful orders. Some have engaged in the academic exercise of drawing lines between lawful and unlawful orders. Others have suggested that military leaders standing firm against this president’s autocratic tendencies may be American democracy’s last hope. Few commentators have considered how Trump v. United States has changed the distinction between lawful and unlawful orders. Before the Supreme Court’ s decision, an order to kill unarmed civilians would have universally been considered an unlawful order. Think: My Lai Massacre, when hundreds of civilians were murdered by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam in 1968. Today, that conclusion is far less certain. Why?

First, although most scholars believe limiting the president’s criminal accountability has no effect on the prosecution of military personnel who violate the law pursuant to his orders, the case left a door open to the notion that absolute immunity might also extend to the president’s agents. If the Court is truly concerned that a president subject to criminal prosecution might be “unduly cautious,” why limit absolute immunity to him? If the Court wants to facilitate bold action, limiting immunity to him alone could mean that bold action will never extend beyond the Oval Office door.

Next, we must always remember that the president has the power to pardon anyone who violates federal criminal law, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During his first administration, Trump pardoned or granted clemency to military members accused or convicted of war crimes. Given that track record, it’s likely that he would pardon anyone who commits a military offense pursuant to his orders.

Finally, if criminal law doesn’t apply to the president when he exercises his core constitutional authority, it is no wonder that some in uniform might question: can any order he issues to the military be considered “unlawful?” To make matters even more confusing, shortly after his second inauguration, Trump seized the opportunity to fill this Court-created legal void by issuing an executive order stating that only the “President and the Attorney General … shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.” In other words, for the armed forces, the law is what Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi say it is.

Americans who cling to the hope that the military will constrain the president’s excesses by disobeying his unlawful orders must recognize that in addition to the confused legal landscape, U.S. military personnel face an unprecedented tsunami of executive actions intended and designed to secure absolute and unquestioning military obedience. Hegseth’s admonition to America’s senior military leaders at Quantico to “do the honorable thing and resign” if his words made their “heart[s] sink,” made it clear that any act of what he considers disloyalty or dissent will be crushed.

Firing the Judge Advocates General of the Army and Air Force was a signal to the armed forces that the law will no longer constrain military operations. Sending 600 JAGs to serve as immigration judges will further thin the ranks of military attorneys available to help commanders and other affected personnel distinguish lawful from unlawful orders.

Targeting suspected “narcotrafficker” boats transiting between Venezuela and points north, reportedly killing 21 people to date, without a plausible legal justification has further eroded the idea that military operations must be conducted in lawful ways.

The subtext in these and many future military decisions, actions, and operations has been and will likely be: the law is what the president says it is.

The Law is Still the Law

If disobeying unlawful orders is no longer a clear legal option or predictable outcome, what is to be done?

First, every military leader, whether in attendance at the Quantico photo op or not, must understand that the law is still the law, even if the Court is willing to exempt the president from its consequences. Rather than maintaining a visible distance from their JAGs, who are increasingly being treated as irrelevant, commanders must proactively seek their legal advice.

For their part, JAGs must understand that the administration’s efforts to marginalize them has ironically underscored their importance. The only way the armed forces can continue to operate in a democratic society is if they understand what the law says and where it applies. If the law as it appears in the Constitution, statute, regulation, and judicial decisions conflicts with the law as the president has defined it or with orders issued in his name, JAGs need to identify, document, and report those conflicts. This is their duty as officers, attorneys, and citizens.

If commanders are ordered to engage in acts or operations affected by conflicting legal interpretations, they must first find a way to achieve stated objectives within the bounds of international and domestic law as commonly understood, not as the president has egregiously misinterpreted them. If that’s not possible, they must speak up, put their concerns in writing, and be willing to resign if necessary.

Lest any commanders or JAGs be lulled by the recent confusion over lawful and unlawful orders into believing that obeying orders commonly regarded as unlawful will be rewarded, not punished, they should understand that their careers, liberty, and honor are not the only ones at stake. The troops they lead are watching. Commanders and JAGs must model proper behavior, to include respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.

Finally, former and retired military leaders need to speak out. Understanding that retired regular officers remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, many will consider the risks too great. Those who do speak out do so for many reasons, not the least of which is their ongoing commitment to the current generation of leaders they have shaped and led. Speaking out professionally and respectfully is a proper way to support the generations of men and women who have succeeded us in uniform.

Our military is and must remain capable of lethality. But lethality and honor must coexist in a democratic society’s armed forces. Making that coexistence a reality today is as great a challenge as any our nation has faced.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2237900419.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:13.201876

President

Arab American Institute

If US President Donald Trump really wants to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, he’s going to need to do better than his 20-point “Comprehensive Plan to End Gaza’s Conflict.” While in his characteristic style of exaggeration, Mr. Trump called the release of his plan “one of the greatest days in human history,” poring over Arab, Israeli, and US press reveals that most analysts are not inclined to see it that way.

After reading commentaries by writers across the board what is most striking is how widely divergent their views are toward Mr. Trump’s effort. While a few in all three regions express hope that the plan represents a pathway to peace, there’s a significant group of Israelis, Arabs, and Americans who see it as flawed and dangerous, albeit for different reasons.

Israeli hardliners, for example, suggest that if Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan were implemented, it will inevitably lead to the creation of a Palestinian state that will pose a mortal threat to Israel’s security. Meanwhile, a sizable body of Arabs express the concern that, if followed, Trump’s plan will make Israel’s occupation permanent, resulting in the dissolution of the Palestinian cause. In fact, the only issues on which there is agreement are that the plan would stop the further devastation in Gaza and allow for the return of Israeli hostages and some Palestinian prisoners.

The reasons behind this wide range of interpretations about the plan’s intentions are many: the Arabs’ well-earned lack of trust in both Trump and Netanyahu; the belief of hardline ideological Israelis that Netanyahu will do whatever it takes to remain prime minister; the deliberate vagueness of most of the plan’s key points; and, especially galling for Palestinians, the fact that they were handed the plan as a fait accompli without having been asked to provide input and told to accept it or, as Mr. Trump put it, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”

Of all of these factors, it’s the vagueness that is problematic for all sides. Israeli hardliners, for example, fret over the mention of an Israeli withdrawal, the presence of Arab peacekeepers, Palestinian police, and the possible return of the PA (which, in their minds, means a link between the West Bank and Gaza leading to a Palestinian state).

Palestinians, on the other hand, reading the document closely, see that none of these provisions are guaranteed. And while there is mention of a phased Israeli withdrawal, the plan provides for Israeli forces to remain in a security perimeter inside Gaza. For Palestinians this means a continuation of the two-decades-long stranglehold Israel has had over all access into and egress from Gaza. They see this plan as too focused on Israeli security, with little regard for justice and Palestinian security.

Another glaring problem is the lack of definition of terms and an enforcement mechanism that will ensure that the terms of the plan are implemented. What, for example, is the definition of the “technocratic apolitical Palestinian committee” that is to be created to run day-to-day operations in Gaza? Will its members be vetted by the Trump-led board? Will the Israelis be able to veto members? And, without any clarity on these points, will this committee be viewed as having legitimacy by Palestinians? And finally, without a defined neutral mechanism for enforcement, will the US allow Israel to act in Gaza as they have with regard to the ceasefires in Lebanon and Syria—where they act as the sole arbiter and enforcer of the agreements? (Their interpretation of ceasefire is apparently “you cease, while we continue to fire.”)

The plan mentions an economic development plan to attract foreign investment that is to be designed by experts who have helped “birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East” and a special economic zone with preferred tariffs. But one is hard pressed to understand the relevance of all of this to the plight and immediate needs of Palestinians, which must take precedence over fantasy cities of the future.

There is some detail provided with regard to Hamas members’ decommissioning their weapons, pledging to commit to peaceful coexistence, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force in Gaza. But what’s not clear is how this will be administered. And while our polls make clear that Palestinians in Gaza have had enough of this war and Hamas, they also express the desire to be governed by a national unity coalition of Palestinians, and want accountability for the crimes committed by the Israeli forces.

The bottom line is that far from being “one of the great days in human history,” the Trump plan is just a start. It may end the bombing and return those held captive, but in order to lead to peace, there must be a great deal more discussion that adds flesh to the bones of the plan. That will require openness and trust on all sides. That said, the following are essential.

First, Hamas should accept the Trump Plan, even while stating their concerns and objections. Continuing the conflict is (and has long been) a dead end. Hamas cannot and should not be the arbiter of the Palestinian future. Too many lives have been lost and many more shattered. The fighting must end. Second, Arabs and other nations must insist that Israelis be held accountable for the crimes they have committed. They can’t be brushed aside. Third, with a ceasefire agreed to by all sides, the massive influx of aid and support that Palestinians will require should commence. Fourth, working from the outline provided by the Trump plan, negotiations should begin, with serious Palestinian input at all levels to flesh out the details that can resolve unanswered questions. Fifth, if the president wants to earn his place in history, he must be willing to crack the whip requiring Israel to adhere to whatever terms are established. And finally, for this to be prize-worthy, the whip-cracking must also be applied to the West Bank and East Jerusalem—and not only with regard to annexation. If peace is to be achieved, settlement expansion, land confiscation, home demolitions, raids, and rampages by settlers must end. These behaviors have weakened the credibility of the PA, won greater support for Hamas, and prepared the ground for even greater conflict.

The Trump plan, with its focus on Israel’s security and vague assurances to Palestinians, succeeded in getting Netanyahu and Hamas on board, each side with their own reservations. If it is to lead to peace, there is hard work ahead.

RELATED: More Perspectives columns PERSPECTIVES POINTERS Some similar concepts to “standing” Ripeness: Case must be developed to the point of where judicial ruling is appropriate.","WIKIPEDIA, Standing (law): “In law, standing means that a person is allowed to file a lawsuit in court.”

As the U. S. Supreme Court starts its 2025-26 term Monday, Oct. 6, the justices will be deciding, among other matters, which litigants are entitled to bring suit, using the doctrine of standing to determine who’s in and who’s not.

The concept of legal standing is well-known to nearly all lawyers, and even to many lay people as well. It consists of the requirement that a litigant asserting a claim must have a sufficient, legally cognizable interest or stake in the outcome of a case to warrant proceeding with a lawsuit.

The U. S. Supreme Court is fond of using this device from time-to-time to avert ruling on the merits of a case, a tenet that Chief Justice Roberts occasionally espouses during oral argument and high court rulings.

A dozen recent cases provide a broad perspective on current and prospective standing suits.

Issue illustrated

An illustration of the standing issue during the court’s 2024-25 term was the granting of a Trump administration’s emergency appeal staying a lower court ruling ordering reinstatement of some 16,000 fired federal government probationary employees on grounds that posture of the nine nonprofit organizations bringing the suit was “insufficient to support [their] standing” in U.S. Office of Personnel Management v. American Federation of Government Employees, 145 S.Ct. 1914 (April 8, 2025) (per curiam).

But two months later the justices found standing for fuel manufacturers challenging a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency to the state of California allowing it to impose stringent restrictions on vehicle emissions.

The justices rejected another standing challenge in Diamond Alternative Energy LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, 145 S.Ct. 2121 (June 20, 2025) on grounds that as “targets,” the fuel makers should not be “locked out” from contesting regulations that may impose harm upon them in the future. This was a decision in which the oral argument portended a ruling that fuel manufacturers have standing to challenge heightened California state regulation of emissions for vehicles and electric cars imposed under a Biden era waiver from lesser federal anti-pollution standards, a holdover case from the prior administration that the Trump administration somewhat surprisingly continued to defend, ostensibly to avoid a recent ruling giving greater latitude to judicial review of governmental-imposed restrictions.

The decision that drew a sharp dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that the court was exhibiting an obedience to “moneyed interests” rather than “ordinary citizens,” which she characterized as a continuation of the tribunal’s undue favoritism of “corporate interests.” Some observers scoffed at her concerns, noting that a couple of days earlier it was revealed that she has been paid nearly $3 million from a “moneyed” publisher for her autobiography “Lovely One: A Memoir.”

The ruling, however, might be moot as Congress has enacted a measure rescinding the EPA’s waiver-granting authority.

But standing, or lack of it, is a device occasionally invoked by the Supreme Court in declining to rule on the merits of cases, as it did last year in dodging and dismissing the challenge by a group of anti-abortion physicians to the accessibility of the mifepristone pill used by many women for induced abortions. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 692 U.S. 367 (2024). That litigation has been revived, however, and is now pending in federal court in Texas as a trio of Republican state attorneys general have taken up the cudgel. Chief Justice Roberts is a frequent questioner at oral argument of the standing of claimants, although others occasionally chime in, too.

Minnesota matters

Those cases stem from a Federal judicial requirement in Article III of the Constitution that courts hear “Cases and Controversies” has been interpreted to incorporate the concept of legal standing. There is no similar provision in Minnesota law, but common law incorporates the same principle in matters arising in this state.

A pair of significant rulings by the Minnesota Supreme Court reached similar results, including one ruling earlier this year and a prior one last year regarding this doctrine.

Although arising in different contexts, the cases both centered on the subject of standing. One involved the restoration of voting rights to felons and the other concerned a collective bargaining issue for Minneapolis school teachers.

However, the outcomes were the same in both cases, with the Supreme Court dismissing the lawsuits based on lack of standing by taxpayers.

Ballot battle

A battle over the right of felons to cast ballots was resolved in favor of a Minnesota statute enacted in 2023 that restored voting rights to most felons after completion of their incarceration in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Hunt, 10 N.W.3d 163 (2024). In its first ruling of the year, the justices unanimously rebuffed a challenge to the law brought by a conservative-oriented advocacy group that frequently challenges voting rights issues.

In a unanimous decision, with two newly appointed jurists not participating, the court upheld the measure, Minn. Stat. § 201014, subd. 2a, entitled the Minnesota Re-Enfranchisement Act, which is estimated to apply to about 60,000 Minnesotans.

The lawsuit was brought by a group of three individual taxpayers and the association to which they belong, Minnesota Voters Alliance (MVA), which has contested a number of voting rights measures over the years, some successful.

This was not one of them because the Ramsey County District Court dismissed the lawsuit, and the Supreme Court, hearing the suit on an accelerated review bypassing the Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Natalie Hudson, affirmed the lower court determination.

Without addressing the merits, the court held that the claimants lacked standing as taxpayers because that indulgence only applies when a dispute is centered on expenditure of public funds.

Reviewing the history of taxpayer standing in Minnesota, the chief justice noted that “binding precedent on taxpayer standing is currently limited to issues of illegal expenditures.” Because the re-enfranchisement statute “does not contemplate government expenditures,” the concerns raised by the taxpayers “are incidental” to their claims for relief and, therefore, they lack standing. A contrary ruling would, the chief justice said, “render the limitations on taxpayer standing to become meaningless” by allowing unrestrained challenges to government actions that involve incidental expenditures, which are disallowed because a “taxpayer cannot manufacture standing by pointing to expenditures that are incidental to implementing the law.”

Because taxpayers lack standing, “it logically follows that their association … does not have associational standing.”

Another associational standing case was addressed this summer in Orono Oaks Volunteer Road Assoc. v. Orono Oaks Assoc., Inc., 2025 WL 2318221 (Minn. App. Aug. 11, 2025)(nonprecedential). The suit was brought by an association consisting of all homeowners in a subdivision that was established to address the failure of a nonprofit association tasked with maintenance of roads in the subdivision. The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the lawsuit for damages due to the neglected maintenance, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

The homeowner’s association bringing the case lacked standing since the claimed damages were “specific” to the individual property owner and cannot be pursued by the association, along with denying a request for a receivership.

Reimbursement ruling

A taxpayer challenge to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the union representing teachers in the Minneapolis public school system and the school district also faltered on grounds of lack of standing in Clapp v. Sayles Adams, 15 N.W.3d 648 (Minn. Jan. 8, 2025).

In its first ruling of this year, the court, again unanimously in a decision written by Justice Karl Procacinni, rejected the claim by a taxpayer who lived in Minneapolis seeking to eradicate a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that included preferential provisions for a racial and ethnic teachers, which the claimant asserted violated the Equal Protection clause of Article I, section 2, of the Minnesota Constitution.

The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the case, but the appellate court reversed, leading the Supreme Court to take the opportunity to apply the requirements for taxpayer standing … that [was] recently clarified” in the Hunt case last year. True to his word, Justice Procacinni, did “resolve this case based on standing,” relying upon “the recent clarification requirements for taxpayer standing in Hunt.” In so doing, the court concluded that the “central dispute in this case did not involve unlawful disbursement of public funds and, therefore, the claimant lacks taxpayer standing.”

Standing sustained

But in another case involving public school teachers in Minnesota, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed taxpayer standing in Huizenga v. Independent School District No. 11, 44 F.4th 806 (8th Cir. 2022). The case was brought by three residents in Anoka County against a school district and the union representing teachers, concerning a teacher reimbursement plan contained in the collective bargaining agreement, which the claimants alleged violated constitutional statutory provisions.

In a per curiam decision, reversing a ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Jerry Blackwell in Minnesota, the court held that the Anoka residents had “adequately alleged that the school district taxpayers” and further identified a “municipal action” that caused injury to them, consisting of the expenditure of tax revenue by a public school district on the “allegedly illegal action” under the bargaining agreement, because the teachers are given up to 100 days of paid leave, which their union does not fully reimburse the school district for those expenses. Because Judge Blackwell had not addressed “preliminary injunction factors,” the case was sent back for determination whether injunctive relief was appropriate.

On remand, Judge Blackwell last year decided it was not and dismissed the case, again, for lack of standing under Article III of the Federal Constitution on grounds that the lawsuit did not demonstrate that municipal taxpayer funds were spent on the contested activity relied on “unclear data and unfounded assumptions, [with] … no actual expenses.” He explained that the lawsuit was premised on an argument that is “the same kind made in households every day — that wages should be higher and expenses should be lower.” That government spending “should be more, less, or allocated differently,” constituted an insufficient basis to sustain standing for the three claimant taxpayers. 727 F. Supp. 3rd 812 (D. Minn. 2024).

The organization supporting the lawsuit, the Upper Midwest Law Center, expressed that it was “disappointed” in the ruling and pledged to appeal it, again, in its commitment to “defending constitutional rights,” which it promptly did last spring, taking it up again to the Circuit Court, which again reversed Judge Blackwell. Huizenga v. Independent School District #11, 2025 WL 2302432 (August 11, 2025) (nonprecedential). By a 2-1 vote, an appellate panel ruled that two of the taxpayers who still lived in the school district had standing to proceed with the case (the other one had moved out) because they established a “direct injury” due to the “direct expenditure of district funds” to pay for substitute teachers to fill in while full-timers were engaged in the permissible non-teaching activities allowed under the union contract. The case, thus, bounced back to Judge Blackwell for a third look at the litigation, a tripling down of the Groundhog Day phenomenon. See Perspectives, “Groundhog Day recalls litigation do-overs” in the January 27, 2025, edition of Minnesota Lawyer.

Latest lawsuits

But Judge Blackwell fared better this summer in another standing dispute in Pickle v. Minnesota Association of Townships, 2025WL 1793838 (8th Cir. June 20, 2025)(nonprecedential), the 8th Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds of lack of standing by Judge Blackwell of the most recent of a multitude of legal actions by a group opposed to actions of a nonprofit organization of township governments. But the court held that the disposition should be without prejudice, rather than with prejudice, because the absence of standing constitutes a jurisdictional defect.

In a case decided a week earlier, the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that a sole shareholder of a consulting company aggrieved by unreasonable expenses in connection with a business project could not sue “in an individual capacity” to seek reimbursement owing to his entity. Levy v. Daily Dental Care, LLC, 2025 WL 1733444 (Minn. App. June 23, 2025)(nonprecedential). The lawsuit could not proceed because the individual owner could not sue for a claimed injury to his company, which alone was entitled to bring the claim.

The summer came to a close with a standing issue that the 8th Circuit bypassed and chose to affirm on other grounds in Swanson v. Hilgers, 2025 WL 2425192 (8th Cir. Aug. 22, 2025). The case was brought by a midwife who challenged various state law regulatory practices that she claimed were violative of her rights and those of her future patients.

But her claim was stillborn at the district court level, which dismissed her claims on the merits and refused to address the prospective patients’ claims on grounds of lack of standing. The circuit court affirmed in the merits, skipping over the standing issue, on grounds that the various challenged licensing restrictions were within the “legitimate interest of protecting health, safety, and welfare.”

To cap off the nine standing suits, the Minnesota Court of Appeals early last month upheld the standing of a labor union-related organization to sue a business offering consumers coupons and access to prescription drugs discounts on grounds that the arrangements violated Minn. Stat. § 325F.784, which governs prescription drug discount cards although it did not claim any actual damages suffered by the group. Affirming a ruling of the McCleod County District Court, the Court of Appeals upheld the standing of the organization to bring that suit because the “plain and unambiguous language” of the statute permits a suit to be brought without the claimant alleging it that it has suffered “an injury in fact” due to misleading or other improper consumer practices, directed to consumers in Minnesota Teamsters Service Bureau v. GoodRx, Inc., 2025 WL 2502013 (Minn. App. Sept. 2, 2025)(nonprecedential).

Suspension standing

As the summer drew to a close the Minnesota Court of Appeals addressed standing, in a criminal case, State v. Peters, 2025 WL 2586840 (Minn. App. Sept. 8, 2025)(nonprecedential). The Polk County District Court’s dismissal of a suppressed motion in a drug possession an driving while impaired (DWI) case on grounds that the defendant lacked standing to challenge his seizure in his car by police in East Grand Forks was reversed. The district court rejected the motion because the defendant was employed in Minnesota in violation of an order from next door in North Dakota, where he lived, while leaving the state when he was on probation without court permission, which he lacked.

Lacking permission, he also lacked standing, the Polk County judge reasoned.

But the reasoning lacked a viable basis, according to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded. It reasoned that the lower court’s rationale was “misguided” because the resident it ruled upon involved a seizure in a home, rather than as here, a vehicle on a public street.

The issue of standing was dispositive last month in a decision by the 8th Circuit rejecting a challenge to the Minnesota “anti-captive audience” law, Minn. Stat. §181.531 in Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors v. Ellison, 2025 WL 2526268_(8th Cir. 2025)(nonprecedential). Reversing a ruling of U. S. District Court Judge Patrick Schlitz, the Court by a 2-1 vote, over the dissent of Judge James Loken of Minnesota, held that the claimant business groups could not pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to the 2023 measure known as the Employer – Sponsored Meetings and Communications Act (ESMCA), one of a dozen in the country, that bars adverse action by employers against employees who decline to receive communications or participate in meetings in which management expound on political “political or religious matters,” including labor union- related issues.

The controlling two members of the panel dismissed claims grounded on the first amendment right of freedom of expression and federal labor law preemption against Gov. Tim Walz and the commissioner of the Department Of Labor And Industry. A claim against Attorney General Keith Ellison also was dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment because he has declared that he will not enforce the law, which negates any “standing“ by the claimants to maintain the statutory challenge.

These varied cases reflect that, regardless of the merits of a lawsuit, claimants must often overcome standing barriers in order to pursue them.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.
“That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.” The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,"" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Friday, total spending on the ads had topped $5.7 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, $794,084, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city's Police Officers Association, said he'd seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city's police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.""

The government shutdown could dampen ICE's recruitment hopes, he said.

""They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,"" he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It's the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who's in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

The Trump administration has adopted a foreign policy approach of prioritizing economic and security relations with countries where interests converge. This strategy may be initially popular with some foreign leaders who think their countries could gain more from trade than they did from aid, but it is already clashing with the administration’s credo of “America First.” This tension is most visible in U.S-Africa relations.

The Trump administration’s early push for a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa that prioritizes trade over aid was welcomed by many African leaders. These leaders have long called for the United States to recognize the African continent as a commercial partner, and not only as an aid recipient. The United States, of course, has a long history of commercial diplomacy in Africa. The Trump administration is trying to distinguish its approach, especially for its domestic constituencies, by emphasizing trade benefits, private sector investments, and bankable partnerships for U.S. businesses, while also seeking to persuade African leaders of the potential for economic growth. Recently retired Ambassador Troy Fitrell, the State Department’s senior bureau official for Africa who helped craft the administration’s policy, told an audience in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, in May 2025 that the administration’s strategy would be implemented in close partnership with U.S companies, African governments, and other stakeholders to create conditions for economic growth on the continent.

While the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

Africa’s growing strategic and geopolitical relevance—given the potential of its burgeoning population and its store of the critical minerals needed to serve the globe’s high-tech needs—offers clear areas where U.S interests converge with opportunities, and a commercial diplomacy strategy could help achieve alignment. But foreign policy does not operate in a vacuum: All foreign policy is inherently domestic, and under this administration, domestic priorities such as supporting U.S. businesses strongly influence the foreign policy agenda. This creates challenges in the conception and execution of a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa. Perhaps two areas where this tension is most visible are trade protectionism and immigration reform.

How Have Trump’s Policies Impacted Africa? How Is Africa Responding?

Trade Protectionism

The Trump administration’s April 2, 2025, “Liberation Day” Executive Order 14257, which proposed significant tariffs aimed at addressing trade deficits and promoting U.S. economic independence, undermines the administration’s own trade-over-aid agenda in Africa. The order (since modified more than once) initially imposed baseline 10 percent tariffs on 29 African countries and placed higher tariffs on 20 more African countries, reaching up to 50 percent for Lesotho—the second-highest rate after China. Lesotho, one of Africa’s smallest economies and greatly reliant on textile exports to the United States, declared a state of disaster in its textile industry before Trump announced a 90-day pause. Following the administration’s modification of reciprocal tariff rates on July 31, Lesotho’s new duty on imports decreased to 15 percent, which has provided some relief. But about 12,000 textile jobs in Lesotho hang in the balance. The country is now courting buyers from other markets for its goods.

Trump also has imposed a 30 percent tariff on select South African goods and has threatened a 10 percent increase in tariffs for nations aligned with the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies. These sets of tariffs impact two of Africa’s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, along with many smaller countries. The 30 percent tariff on South Africa is expected to significantly impact the country’s job market, especially in the automotive parts industry, which relies heavily on duty-free exports to the United States. Nigeria’s tariff rate, now at 15 percent, may rise by an additional 10 percent given it recently joined BRICS in January 2025 as a partner country, just before Trump took office with a view of BRICS’ policies as “anti-American.”

Although the Trump administration ultimately modified some of its tariffs on Africa, the levies have caused uncertainty and panic for many African countries that rely heavily on trade with the United States. The tariffs have shaken African economies and raised significant doubts about the intent of the United States’ commercial diplomacy strategy, with some questioning whether it is only about securing minerals from the continent and not a mutually beneficial partnership.

The Trump administration has demonstrated a preference for a transactional foreign policy approach on the continent; for example, earlier this year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) offered exclusive mineral rights for U.S. companies in exchange for U.S. security assistance against the M23 rebel group, a paramilitary force backed by neighboring Rwanda. The request influenced a subsequent peace deal between the DRC and Rwanda, brokered by the United States, that apparently would grant rights to certain critical minerals to foreign investors, including from the United States. The declaration of principles for peace that was signed in June 2025 by the foreign ministers of the DRC and Rwanda purportedly is intended to provide economic incentives for all parties involved through what State Department Senior Advisor on Africa Massad Boulos described as a “regional economic integration framework.”

The U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

The quest to secure critical minerals appears to be a key focus of this administration, playing a significant role in Trump’s early overtures to Ukraine as well. And while the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region. Notably, the presidents of the warring countries were absent from the June signing, which included an Oval Office appearance with the two foreign ministers; a key rebel group was not involved in those talks; and significant hurdles to implementation remain. Without an enabling environment of stability and security, it would be difficult for U.S businesses to operate in the region.

The tariffs also placed a question mark over the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which has given African countries tariff-free access to U.S. markets for 25 years. AGOA expired in September 2025, and at the time of this writing, there is no clear indication of whether and how it will be renewed, a step that would have to be taken by Congress. Many in the Trump administration have noted its significance, and Trump himself, when asked about AGOA during the July 2025 summit he conducted with five African presidents—from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—said that he would “look at” extending the trade pact. But many African leaders doubt the prospects of AGOA’s renewal, given its no-tariff regime for some goods.

Meanwhile, China is already Africa’s biggest trading partner, giving nearly the entire continent tariff-free access to its markets: In June 2025, China removed tariffs for 53 African countries. That will help expand the already notable gap between Chinese and U.S. trade figures with Africa—Africa’s trade in goods with China rose 6.1 percent in 2024 to $295 billion compared with $72 billion of goods traded with the United States.

In response to this uncertain environment and to counter Trump’s tariffs, African countries are doubling down on efforts to leverage their flagship free trade initiative, the African Continental Free Trade Area. That initiative, which began trading in 2021 to bring the continent’s 1.4 billion people in more than 50 countries into a single market, has been slow in implementation. While 49 countries have ratified the agreement, fewer than half are actively trading under its umbrella—though the initiative has still seen some progress. In the meantime, African nations are expanding trade ties with China, the European Union, and Persian Gulf states.

Immigration Reform

The Trump administration’s immigration policies also undermine its commercial diplomacy strategy and economic partnership narrative with Africa. Washington has imposed sweeping visa and travel restrictions under the premise that tightening them protects U.S. national security. But these moves significantly harm many African countries by, among other impacts, hindering the travel required for trade and investment, distracting African leaders who must deal with the sociopolitical effects, and poisoning the atmosphere between U.S. and African leaders.

Distracting from economic issues, the administration’s July summit with the five African leaders included a push to have African countries accept third-country nationals deported from the United States, hardly creating the atmosphere of mutual respect needed to develop strong economic relations. Furthermore, the United States has imposed complete or partial visa bans on at least 19 countries, 10 of which are in Africa. All this comes on top of Trump’s divisive new policy of admitting white Afrikaner South Africans who claim persecution because of discrimination and violence as refugees.

Multiple African officials have condemned the punitive Trump administration measures as unacceptable and counterproductive. Nigeria, for example, said that while it is eager to strengthen trade ties with the United States, the travel restrictions are a major hinderance. Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar publicly rejected the Trump administration’s pressure for the country to accept third-nation asylum seekers, saying the country has “enough problems of our own” and will not cave to U.S. coercion to take in deportees with no ties to Nigeria.

The Trump administration’s new immigration policies also severely restrict student visas, with many African youth heavily impacted; even those already studying in the United States are being cautioned against leaving because they may not be able to return. This is another case of the Trump administration shooting its foreign trade and investment policy in the wallet, so to speak, as Africa’s youth boom is becoming a major economic force globally. The World Economic Forum has reported that “by 2035, there will be more young Africans entering the workforce each year than in the rest of the world combined.” And China already has a significant numbers advantage over the United States in attracting the best and brightest of them to its education system.

Implications and Recommendations for the United States

The United States must rightfully prioritize its domestic national interests. But foreign policy interests are inextricably intertwined with domestic priorities in today’s globally interdependent world, even for the economically powerful United States. It would be shortsighted, to say the least, to hamper potentially beneficial and even lucrative economic ties abroad with counterproductive measures that might undermine the goals of trade and economic growth. The Trump administration risks falling further into that trap by failing to balance these interests in a way that helps, not hurts, Americans—not to mention, in this case, Africans as well. The administration’s much-touted commercial diplomacy is at stake.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries, and it cannot just be to displace China with more of the same. That would be of little interest to African leaders or Africa’s citizens. Why shift from one usurious “partner” to another?

Instead, the Trump administration would find more economic success by understanding fully how it can distinguish itself in the eyes of potential partners. As noted, China already surpasses the United States in trade with African countries and is also increasing its investment in the soft-power approaches that the United States has been using for years, such as in education. And now the Trump administration is eviscerating many of the soft-power tools that gave the country a competitive edge in Africa, not only by restricting immigration and educational exchange but also by dismantling major institutions such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the source of extensive U.S.-Africa economic ties. Among other initiatives, the gutting of USAID took down the 2013 Power Africa project, which aimed to help the continent get up to par on energy production—crucial to any economic development. Another program that fell to the axe was Prosper Africa, a promising initiative created under the first Trump administration that facilitated the creation of the government-backed but private U.S.-Africa Trade Desk to further enhance trade cooperation. The Trump administration has also suspended the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, which once helped reduce risks in early-stage investments and could have been instrumental in ensuring a successful commercial diplomacy strategy. And while the administration retained its Africa bureau in a recent reorganization of the State Department, it has considered significantly scaling back embassy representation on the continent.

Some of the best-performing government agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) are now under severe budget-cutting pressure. Despite this, the MCC seems to be rebounding with the recent announcement of a $300 million electrification grant for Cote D’Ivoire. Investments like this by the MCC are crucial to deliver the infrastructure needed for successful trade and investment and ensuring that its high-profile senior-level delegations to the continent are not simply symbolic. The administration has signaled that it plans to rely much more on financial institutions such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation—also facing reauthorization this year—which provides financing and other assistance for development projects, and the U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank, which provides credit to support U.S. trade. The EXIM Bank, for example, announced in August a $66 million guarantee for a small Washington, D.C.–based exporter of equipment for a new national data center in Côte d’Ivoire. But even then, the announcement makes clear that a key motivator is that the offer “displaces competition” from China. The project could nevertheless be promising, if it is accompanied by the right personnel on the ground—after all, people equal policy.

Similarly, the administration still has a chance to correct or offset its travel restrictions and tariff decisions and its extensive cuts to foreign assistance and diplomacy in ways that support the president’s agenda of commercial diplomacy with Africa, rather than weakening U.S. influence around the globe. The reorganization of the State Department, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in May 2025, should be aimed at ensuring that qualified personnel with experience on the continent are in decisionmaking positions for any offices or programs related to Africa. The department needs advanced skills and experience to successfully navigate complex relationships, not only with overseas partners but also with other U.S. government agencies that could be helpful if the president is really serious about an agenda that prioritizes trade over aid. Any budget deliberations with Congress for FY 2026 should ensure sufficient funding to keep embassies staffed and running and for the State Department to advance these priorities. Renewing AGOA should be another priority—it is not a perfect tool, but it offers the possibility to innovate and create more jobs and opportunities for both the United States and Africa.

In pursuing their commercial diplomacy, Trump and his cabinet should ask—and answer—a question honestly: What makes the United States different from China? The perceptions of citizens everywhere are shaped by their lived experiences, and Africans’ perceptions of China remain relatively positive despite some recent decreases in Chinese funding to the continent. The most recent Afrobarometer survey of 30 African countries finds that 60 percent of Africans hold a positive view of China’s economic and political influence, compared with 53 percent who say the same of the United States. Five years earlier, the two global powers were neck-in-neck, at 59 percent for China and 58 percent for the United States.",https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-10/GettyImages-2224312581_cropped.jpg?VersionId=iL6bdy8.YpsqMfu0HWT5SyI4ZXGAG1zr,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:33.699253

Local cops were initially prepared to help the agents, but were ordered to stand down by the chief of patrol, according to shocking dispatch audio transmissions.
“PLEASE CHIEF OF PATROL NO UNITS WILL RESPOND TO THIS AS RELATED FROM 04-Oc5-2025/12:34:44…CALLER IS 1 OF APPROX 30 ARMED PATROL AGENTS (ICE) WHO ARE BEING SURROUNDED BY A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE REQUESTING CPD,” the dispatch message read.

The group of agents was conducting a routine patrol on the city’s South Side on Saturday “when they were attacked and rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

The agents were on patrol about 15 miles from the anti-ICE protests that had been simmering for several days outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when the attack began.

Once they attempted to flee their trapped vehicle, a woman — later found to be toting a semi-automatic weapon — attempted to run the officers down, but was shot by police.

Local cops were initially prepared to help the agents, but were ordered to stand down by the chief of patrol, according to shocking dispatch audio transmissions.

“Younger male Hispanic wearing all black … wanted for the hit-and-run, this guy fled from the scene,” a female dispatcher blares in response to a call for help from the surrounded ICE agents on audio shared by ExxAlerts.

“When the offending vehicle crashed, they ran the federal agent off the road, they fled on foot westbound.”

A male voice then comes on the radio channel, telling the dispatcher to direct officers to head to the scene and “stay put” a few blocks away and await further instruction, which she relays.

A few seconds later, the male voice is heard again, saying tersely: “Per the chief of patrol: Clear everybody out, we’re not responding over there.”

The female dispatcher then tells officers on the way to the distress call, “per the chief of patrol, all units clear out from there, we’re not sending anybody out to that location.”

A male officer responds over the sound of sirens wailing in the background, saying, “We’re going to clear out as soon as we can, we’re like blocked in over here so we’re going to do the best we can to get out of here as soon as we can.”

An internal department memo sent to Chicago cops and obtained by Fox News confirms the shocking reversal.

“PLEASE CHIEF OF PATROL NO UNITS WILL RESPOND TO THIS AS RELATED FROM 04-Oc5-2025/12:34:44…CALLER IS 1 OF APPROX 30 ARMED PATROL AGENTS (ICE) WHO ARE BEING SURROUNDED BY A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE REQUESTING CPD,” the dispatch message read.

The Chicago Police Department disputed the claims, saying its officers were on the scene.

“To clarify misinformation currently circulating, CPD officers did in fact respond to the shooting scene involving federal authorities on Saturday to maintain public safety and traffic control,” the department said in a statement to Fox.

“The Chicago Police Department will always respond to anyone who is being attacked or is under the threat of physical harm,” the department added. “For incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, CPD supervisors will respond to the scene and determine the appropriate course of action in accordance with City law.”

Ten cars had surrounded the federal agents, Trump officials said.

“Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked — rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X in response to the attack, pledging to send more resources to the crime-ravaged city.

The mob had gathered in the area near 39th Place and South Kedzie Avenue to protest the shooting of the armed woman and was met with tear gas deployed by federal agents, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The latest spate of violence in the Windy City comes after US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor [JB] Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the department announced in an X post.

Protesters have increasingly used vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area in recent days, according to DHS, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner in one day earlier this week.

No officers were injured in the mob attack, and the woman shot defensively by police reportedly drove herself to the hospital to be treated for her wounds.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

But until now, the justices have not squarely addressed the legality of Mr. Trump’s boundary-pushing policies to transform the government.
In January, the court will consider whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor.
Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, cautioned against reading too much into the Supreme Court’s preliminary orders.
Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.","When the nine justices of the Supreme Court return to their raised mahogany bench each year on the first Monday of October, it typically marks the end of a three-month stretch of rest and reflection.

But this summer’s traditional recess was anything but a cooling-off period.

Instead, the justices churned through emergency requests from the Trump administration that sharply divided the court along ideological lines, in a reflection of how much President Trump’s agenda has consumed their calendar.

The president’s policies will have an even more central role in the term that begins on Monday, after the justices agreed to take three cases with broad consequences for his agenda. In November, they will hear arguments about the legality of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a centerpiece of his trade strategy. In December, they will consider Mr. Trump’s efforts to wrest control of independent agencies, and in January, his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board.

By the time the term ends in June, there could be others. Already, the administration has asked the court to take up a pair of cases testing the legality of the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, an issue that raises fundamental questions about what it means to be an American.

The result will be a term of generational consequence for the court and the presidency, and a defining one for the legacy of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will mark his 20th year on the bench.

“It’s hard to imagine bigger tests of presidential power than these potentially once-in-a-century separation-of-powers battles,” said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer at the firm Gupta Wessler who frequently argues cases before the justices. “And we’re seeing more than one of them at once.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, the court’s conservative majority has repeatedly sided with the administration. But those decisions came in a series of emergency, unsigned orders. Often published without reasoning on what critics call the “shadow docket,” the orders have technically been temporary, addressing whether a challenged policy could be implemented while its legality was tested in court.

But until now, the justices have not squarely addressed the legality of Mr. Trump’s boundary-pushing policies to transform the government.

That will change this term, as the justices confront Mr. Trump’s policies head-on, offering final judgments on whether they are legal, in cases that include oral arguments and decisions with lengthy opinions.

“We’re going to see, among others things, whether the Supreme Court is actually going to say no to Donald Trump on anything,” said Pamela S. Karlan, a co-director of Stanford Law School’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic and former Justice Department official in the Obama and Biden administrations.

“They’ve tried to dodge and tried to dodge and tried to dodge saying no to him by coming up with procedural ways to say yes to him,” Ms. Karlan said. “But I don’t see how they get out of this term doing it that way.”

Apart from the administration’s cases testing the limits of executive authority, the court will hear a series of other consequential matters, including more politically charged legal battles over gender identity.

Last term, the court divided along ideological lines when it allowed Tennessee to prohibit some medical treatments for transgender youths. On Tuesday, the justices will consider a challenge from a Christian therapist who objected to a Colorado law prohibiting licensed mental health therapists from counseling minors to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The court will also hear legal challenges to state laws barring transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams.

Major cases that could reshape the election landscape are also on the docket, including one that could result in the justices striking down or severely restraining a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

That case involves a challenge to Louisiana’s voting map, which was adopted following the 2020 census and includes two majority-Black congressional districts.

The justices heard a challenge to the map in the spring. Rather than rule on whether state lawmakers unlawfully emphasized race in drawing the map, as some non-Black residents had argued, the justices announced that they would hear the case again with a more expansive constitutional question. The rare move suggested that some members of the court might be ready to use the case to gut the Voting Rights Act, a pillar of the Civil Rights era that conservatives have been whittling down in recent years.

The justices this week will also hear a challenge to rules on mail-in ballots in Illinois, a case that could open the way for efforts to restrict voting by mail. And later in the term, the court will consider what could become a landmark case on campaign finance regulations — a challenge to federal guardrails that limit political parties from coordinating with candidates to spend money on campaign advertising.

But the heart of the court’s work this term, which by tradition will stretch into late June or early July, is likely to involve Mr. Trump.

The justices have so far issued more than 20 orders in response to emergency applications involving the Trump administration, ruling overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s favor in decisions that were technically placeholders.

Their rulings have addressed preliminary questions, such as who has the right to sue and in which court. But the immediate impact of those interim orders has been significant. In recent months, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to withhold billions of dollars in foreign aid funding; to begin dismantling the Education Department; to deport migrants to war-torn countries where they have no connections; and to kick transgender troops out of the military. While the majority’s rulings are often brief, the three liberal justices have issued lengthy and impassioned dissents.

Irv Gornstein, who leads the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown Law School, said it was hard to ignore the court’s overwhelming habit of dividing along ideological lines when issuing emergency orders in the Trump administration’s favor.

Mr. Gornstein added that if those voting patterns hold when the court reaches final decisions about the validity of the administration’s policies, and with other controversial cases on its docket, “we are in for one of the most polarizing terms yet.”

The opening months of the term feature back-to-back tests of the president’s agenda. The justices have fast-tracked review of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, after a lower court said the president exceeded his authority by invoking a 1970s-era emergency power to tax imports from major trading partners. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act has typically been used to impose sanctions and embargoes against other nations. It does not mention the word tariff.

Some leading conservative and libertarian scholars have said in court filings that the president’s use of the statute to impose tariffs was unlawful, and that the power to tax must remain with Congress. If the justices agree with the lower courts that Mr. Trump improperly invoked the act, the president will be forced to remove that set of tariffs. But the administration is already issuing tariffs under other legal provisions.

In December, the court will examine the president’s power to fire a leader of the Federal Trade Commission, revisiting a 90-year precedent that has allowed Congress to pass laws preventing presidents from removing independent regulators solely over policy disagreements.

Even before Mr. Trump returned to office, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority had taken steps to make it easier for presidents to remove independent agency leaders, signaling it would be receptive to claims of executive power.

In January, the court will consider whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor. The justices have signaled in a separate case that the Fed is uniquely independent, and their decision will have far-reaching implications for the central bank and the U.S. economy.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, cautioned against reading too much into the Supreme Court’s preliminary orders. Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.

“That’s why this term is so important. Plenty of folks think that question has already been answered, but the conclusive evidence is still to come,” Mr. Vladeck said.

Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William & Mary who specializes in administrative and constitutional law, said that one reason Mr. Trump had been so successful at the court so far was that his lawyers had been able to cherry-pick which cases to bring to the justices, largely avoiding some of the thornier disputes.

The result, he said, was an “unrepresentative sample.”

The rulings so far “don’t really tell us how the court views the substance of what the administration has been planning,” he said.

Chief Justice Roberts this term will become the fourth-longest-serving chief in the court’s history.

A student of history, he is an admirer of the longest-serving chief justice in American history, John Marshall, who avoided issuing rulings that would provoke direct confrontations with President Thomas Jefferson — a model he will now have to decide whether to emulate.

He will preside over a court with members who appear to be growing more restless. Throughout the summer, in appearances at judicial conferences and book talks, the justices aired disagreements over how the court was handling the president’s many requests, including how much the court should explain itself to the public and lower-court judges.

Tensions among the justices have also spilled out in their emergency rulings, in which the court’s liberals have sometimes included sharp words as their colleagues have cleared the way for the president’s agenda.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in particular has pointedly criticized her conservative colleagues, characterizing one ruling in July as “not only truly unfortunate but also hubristic and senseless.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested in a separate dissent in July that the majority was giving special treatment to Mr. Trump, writing that the administration “has the Supreme Court on speed dial.”

Kannon Shanmugam, who regularly argues cases before the court, said the bench that Chief Justice Roberts joined in 2005 was made up of justices who appeared more interested in the court’s institutional reputation.

“I think the chief justice is very much in that vein, but he doesn’t have a lot of partners right now in that regard, said Mr. Shanmugam, who was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. “The challenge the chief justice has going forward is in managing this somewhat more individualistic and somewhat more fractious group of colleagues.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/05/multimedia/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:28.516172

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his government resigned today. Lecornu, who was appointed in September, named his new cabinet hours before their resignations. Lecornu pointed to political parties “who continue to posture as if they had a majority” in France’s hung National Assembly as the reason for his decision. France’s main opposition parties called on French President Emmanuel Macron to call new parliamentary elections or resign in the wake of Lecornu’s departure. Victor Goury-Laffont reports for POLITICO.

The populist party of the Czech Republic’s former Prime Minister, billionaire Andrej Babiš, on Saturday won parliamentary elections in the country, although it fell short of an overall majority. Babiš, who during the election campaign argued that the high consumer costs are linked to the Czech Republic spending too much to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, is expected to be invited to lead talks on forming a new coalition. Rob Cameron reports for BBC News; Lara Jakes reports for the New York Times.

Syria yesterday held its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad regime, with the vote count ongoing at the time of writing. Voting in three provinces dominated by Kurdish and Druze factions was postponed due to “security and logistical challenges,” the authorities said. Eyad Kourdi reports for CNN.

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Saturday elected hardline conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. If confirmed in an Oct. 15 parliamentary vote, Takaichi will become the country’s first female prime minister. A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as “Abenomics.” Tim Kelly, John Geddie, and Satoshi Sugiyama report for Reuters; Shaimaa Khalil reports for BBC News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner are expected to participate in negotiations in Egypt today on ending the war in Gaza, according to a White House official. Delegations from Israel and Hamas will participate in indirect talks on the first phase of the deal, concerning hostage release and prisoner exchange mediated by Egypt and Qatar, the Egyptian foreign ministry said yesterday. Hamas on Friday expressed willingness to release the remaining hostages but did not comment on many other parts of the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan, such as disarmament. Ashley Ahn, Shawn McCreesh, and Aaron Boxerman report for the New York Times.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday said that the United States was aiming for a quick deal to return the hostages to Israel, noting that the next phase of negotiations dealing with disarmament and setting up a new government in Gaza would be tougher. Trump said yesterday that talks with Hamas were advancing rapidly. “I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said on social media. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters; Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Israeli airstrikes killed at least 36 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, according to local health officials. 18 people died in sporadic incidents, while 18 others were killed in a strike on a house in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, medical staff said. The strikes occurred after Trump’s call on social media on Friday evening for Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Trump on Saturday said he appreciated that Israel had “temporarily stopped bombing.” Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Mahmoud Issa report for Reuters.

“I don’t know why you’re always so f***ing negative. This is a win. Take it,” Trump told Netanyahu on Friday evening following Hamas’ initial positive response to the ceasefire plan, a U.S. official told Axios. The source said that Netanyahu had told Trump there was nothing to celebrate and that Hamas’ position meant nothing. An Israeli official said that Netanyahu viewed Hamas’ response as a rejection of Trump’s plan. Trump told Axios on Saturday that Netanyahu’s “fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine.” Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report.

Israel has deported a further 29 activists who were detained last week for taking part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, the Israeli foreign ministry said yesterday. Israel has deported 170 of the 450 detained activists so far. Alexander Cornwell reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia yesterday killed at least five people and damaged energy infrastructure across Ukraine, officials said. Four of those killed were in the western Lviv region, bordering Poland. The combined assault, which involved dozens of missiles and over 500 drones, struck nine regions in Ukraine and cut electricity for tens of thousands of people. Siobhán O’Grady and Serhiy Morgunov report for the Washington Post; Andriy Perun and Dan Peleschuk report for Reuters.

There is evidence of a “high level of cooperation” between China and Russia “in conducting satellite reconnaissance” of Ukraine to identify strategic objects to target, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said on Saturday. The official did not disclose what evidence supported this position. Ron Popeski reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda will not sign an economic framework agreement this week as scheduled under the U.S.-brokered June peace agreement, sources told Reuters on Friday. According to a Rwandan official, the text was finalized after a round of negotiations in Washington, D.C., but Kinshasa was unwilling to sign the deal. Daphne Psaledakis, Jessica Donati, and Sonia Rolley report.

The U.N. Human Rights Council will today consider an EU proposal to set up a U.N. investigation into abuses in Afghanistan by both the Taliban and foreign troops similar to existing investigations into crimes in Syria and Myanmar. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

The Somali government today said that all seven al-Shabab militants who on Saturday attacked a high-security prison in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu have been killed. Neither the government nor al-Shabab confirmed their respective numbers of casualties. Wedaeli Chibelushi and Mohamud Abdisamad report for BBC News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices today announced a new multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that would run on AMD’s new MI450 chips. The OpenAI-AMD agreement is one the most direct challenges yet to Nvidia’s dominance in the chipmaking sector. Robbie Whelan and Berber Jin report for the Wall Street Journal.

A Kremlin-backed cryptocurrency operation appears to have circumvented U.S. sanctions, moving at least $6 billion since August when several of its entities were blacklisted, according to a Financial Times analysis. Anastasia Stognei, Oliver Hawkins, and Eade Hemingway report.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Trump is expected to reduce refugee admissions from 125,000 to 7,500 people per year, according to a presidential determination signed 30 September seen by the New York Times. The unannounced refugee program proposes to reserve a bulk of the limited slots for white Afrikaners from South Africa, according to sources. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Hamed Aleaziz, and Miriam Jordan report

ICE agents arrested 37 people and separated U.S. children from their parents during an overnight raid on apartments in Chicago last week. The Homeland Security Department said the building was targeted because it was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members.” Tenants said it appeared that everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including four children who are U.S. citizens. DHS said the children were taken because their parents were detained due to their lack of legal status. Rebekah Riess and Bill Kirkos report for CNN.

The Trump administration is offering $2,500 to minors who came to the United States alone to “voluntarily” return to their home countries under a programme rolled out on Friday without a press release. ICE confirmed to POLITICO that ICE and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugees and Resettlement are offering a “strictly voluntary” self-deportation service. Erica Bazail-Eimil reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN

Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces hit another vessel allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela on Saturday. It is currently unclear if Trump was in fact referencing a strike announced on Friday by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “They’re not coming in by sea anymore, so now we’ll have to start looking about the land,” Trump continued in a speech delivered at Naval Station Norfolk. Reuters reports.

The U.S. military killed four people in a strike against a boat in international waters near Venezuela, Hegseth announced on Friday. Hegseth alleged that the men had been smuggling narcotics but did not offer any evidence. This was the first strike since the Trump administration told Congress that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with Latin American cartels. Hegseth said yesterday that he has every authorization needed for U.S. military strikes on vessels off the coast of Venezuela. “These are designated foreign terrorist organizations.” Charlie Savage reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

China is using a barter-like system to pay Iran for oil while bypassing U.S. sanctions, Western officials told the Wall Street Journal. In order to side-step the international banking system, Iranian oil is shipped to China and, in return, state-backed Chinese companies build infrastructure in Iran. Some officials said that up to $8.4 billion in oil payments flowed through the hidden funding conduit last year to finance the Chinese infrastructure projects. Lauren Norman and James T. Areddy report.

Advisers of Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir approached U.S. officials with an offer to build and run a port on the Arabian Sea, according to a plan seen by the Financial Times. The plan envisages U.S. investors developing the town of Pasni as a terminal to ship Pakistan’s critical minerals to the United States. A senior U.S. official said that Trump and his advisers had not discussed such a proposal. Alec Russell and Humza Jilani report.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) yesterday criticised ICE agents for using increasingly violent tactics in Chicago, such as deploying chemical agents near a public school. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Pritzker said. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades.” Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration was intentionally heightening tensions in Chicago in order to send “even more troops.” Sophia Tareen reports for AP News.

“This morning, the Trump administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Gov. JB Pritzker said on Saturday, adding that Trump plans to federalize 300 National Guard troops in Illinois despite his clear opposition. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth considered sending an elite U.S. Army strike force to Portland to quell the protests last weekend, according to messages shared with the Minnesota Star Tribune. The messages show high-level officials discussing the deployment of the Army’s 82nd Airborne, an infantry division deployed during both world wars and the Vietnam War. Anthony Salisbury, a deputy to White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, sent the texts over Signal while traveling in Minnesota, in clear view of others. Andy Mannix reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump administration is preparing a plan that would make it harder for older Americans to qualify for Social Security disability payments, sources tell the Washington Post. Under the plan, the Social Security Administration would either no longer consider age in assessing whether a person can adjust to other types of work, or the age threshold would be increased to 60 years, the sources said. Meryl Kornfield and Lisa Rein report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge this weekend twice blocked the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops into Oregon. In her initial Saturday order, the judge ruled that Trump’s claims that Portland was experiencing daily unrest were “untethered to facts” and said that she expected a trial court to find that the move exceeded Trump’s constitutional authority and likely violated the Tenth Amendment. Late yesterday, the judge issued a follow-up order banning the Trump administration from sending any National Guard troops to Portland after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tried to send hundreds of members of Texas’ and California’s National Guard to Oregon. The judge said that Hegseth’s action appeared to be “in direct contravention” of her earlier decision. The Trump administration has appealed the Saturday order. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO; Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times; Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration can, for now, proceed with plans to remove the Biden-era extension of Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The case returned to the Supreme Court after the administration appealed a substantive lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to have broken the law by revoking the TPS for Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. In a brief order, the majority of the court ruled that “although the posture of the case has changed [since May, when the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary injunction blocking Noem’s move], the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not.” Julianna Bragg reports for Axios; Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the indictment filed against Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia amounted to a vindictive prosecution by the Justice Department. The judge held that Abrego is entitled to discovery and requires an evidentiary hearing before the Court decides on his motion to dismiss his indictment. Alan Feuer reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION — LAWSUITS

A group of unions, higher education professionals, religious organizations, and others on Friday filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to charge a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, granted to skilled foreign workers. The lawsuit argues that Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally alter the visa program and that the administration did not go through the required regulatory process to institute the fee. Madeleine Ngo and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times.

A federal workers union on Friday filed a complaint suing the Trump administration over its insertion of blaming Democrats for the government shutdown into Education Department employees’ out-of-office email messages. The lawsuit argues that “Forcing civil servants to speak on behalf of the political leadership’s partisan agenda is a blatant violation of federal employees’ First Amendment rights.” Shannon Bond reports for NPR.

Over 200 international students whose visas were withheld by the Trump administration are suing the State Department to get their visas reinstated, according to court documents reviewed by the Hill. Surina Benkat reports.

The justices have so far granted a small list of petitions with employment and labor law implications, but are set to hear at least one dispute by November concerning the legal and constitutional protections that apply to prisoners or detainees who perform work.

The FTC case and equal protection challenges to states banning transgender girls and women from competing on female athletic teams are likely to have significant ripple effects in the labor and anti-bias legal arenas.

More cases are likely to come this term.

The high court is expected to ultimately review the merits of ongoing disputes over President Donald Trump’s unprecedented terminations of Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as mass firings of federal workers after the majority used its controversial “shadow docket” to greenlight those actions as litigation plays out.

Here’s how the upcoming Supreme Court term is kicking off for employment law:

Separation-of-Powers

The Trump administration’s push to topple a 90-year-old precedent and expand the White House’s power over federal agencies that previously operated outside of its direct control, including those regulating labor and employment, will take center stage in Trump v. Slaughter.

That case concerns a FTC Democratic member’s challenge to his termination. But it goes to the heart of the Supreme Court’s Humphrey’s Executor v. US decision, which upheld the constitutionality of job shields for FTC members by allowing only dismissals for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” and opened the door for similar safeguards for other independent agencies.

The administration hasn’t argued that Humphrey’s Executor must be overturned to justify Trump’s dismissal of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox and MSPB member Cathy Harris, who have tenure protections similar to those of FTC members. The US Justice Department claimed the justices’ 2020 Seila Law v. CFPB ruling suggests they’re not insulated by Humphrey’s Executor due to the executive authority they exercise.

Cases arising from the president’s recent firings raise novel legal questions. The high court’s final decision in Slaughter could offer precise guidance to lower courts on the scope of presidential removal power.

The case will be argued during the court’s December argument session, which begins Dec. 1 and ends Dec. 10.

Detainee Wage Case

Attorneys for Geo Group Inc. and a class of civil immigrant detainees will face off at oral arguments on Nov. 10 over whether the high court should allow the private prison operator to seek immediate appellate review of its derivative sovereign immunity defense.

GEO, which has a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract to run detention facilities, is accused of forcing detainees in Colorado to perform various jobs—including preparing food, operating the library, and doing laundry—or risk solitary confinement under a voluntary work program. They were paid just $1 per day, the suit said.

The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit last year upheld a district judge’s summary judgment ruling on GEO’s immunity defense, saying immediate review is unwarranted before the detainees’ underlying claims are addressed.

The justices now have an opportunity to resolve a split among eight federal circuit courts, five of which the private prison operator said foreclosed immediate review of district court orders blocking government contractors from raising a derivative sovereign immunity defense in litigation regarding their contracts.

A Supreme Court order mandating immediate circuit review of the legal defense, which allows government contractors to claim immunity that the US would have had if sued for the same actions, would benefit cases beyond the labor law context. But for detained immigrant workers, an additional procedural step in the litigation process would further extend the timeline for arguing the merits of their allegations in court, attorneys and prison labor scholars said.

GEO’s high court petition maintained that the justices need to clear up the circuit divide, as the legal path for litigants is currently unclear.

The underlying lawsuit is just one of several currently being litigated across the US for similar programs, and the question of whether state labor law applies to federal immigration detainees has been a novel issue.

Transgender Rights

High court cases Little v. Hecox and West Virginia Board of Education v. B.P.J. center on whether state laws banning transgender athletes from participating on female sports teams violate the US Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

A ruling in both disputes could significantly affect transgender rights in sports, but also potentially clarify the scope of anti-discrimination protections for gender identity in broader contexts like employment and education, court watchers said.

Transgender workers have invoked the Equal Protection Clause in discrimination cases, including a recent challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s retreat from transgender discrimination enforcement.

Last term, the Supreme Court declined to clarify the level of review for Equal Protection claims in transgender bias cases, but three conservative justices expressed that the more lenient rational basis applies, rather than “intermediate” scrutiny.

Asked on Sunday night when federal workers would be fired as he has threatened to do, Trump told reporters: ""It's taking place right now and it's all because of the Democrats.""

""The Democrats are causing the loss of a lot of jobs,"" Trump added, declining to answer a question about which agencies are subject to the cuts.

The possibility of layoffs would escalate an already tense situation in which Washington lawmakers have struggled to find common ground and build mutual trust. Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave.

Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels as he believes that Democrats will have to cave because of the jobs and federal projects being put at risk.

The squabble comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as Trump's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting last Monday.

""And, unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,"" Jeffries said. ""And what we've seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes, and of course President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That's not responsible behavior.""

The Trump administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.

Even though it would be Trump's choice to cut jobs, he believes he can put the blame on the Democrats because of the shutdown.

""It's up to them,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday morning before boarding the presidential helicopter to celebrate the Navy's 250th anniversary in Norfolk, Virginia.

While Trump rose to fame on the TV show ""The Apprentice"" with its catchphrase of ""You're fired,"" Republicans on Sunday claimed that the administration would take no pleasure in letting go of federal workers, even though the administration had also put funding on hold for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic areas without clear signs of remorse.

""We haven't seen the details yet about what's happening"" with layoffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday morning on NBC. ""But it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want.""

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, also said the administration would prefer to avoid the layoffs.

""We want the Democrats to come forward and to make a deal that's a clean, continuing resolution that gives us seven more weeks to talk about these things,"" Hassett said on CNN. ""But the bottom line is that with Republicans in control, the Republicans have a lot more power over the outcome than the Democrats.""

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying on NBC that the possible increase in health care costs for ""millions of Americans"" would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a ""crisis.""

But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has stopped congressionally approved spending from being used. That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in "" pocket rescissions "" on foreign aid, a process that meant the spending was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.

""We need both to address the health care crisis and we need some written assurance in the law - I won't take a promise - that they're not going to renege on any deal we make,"" Schiff said.

The television appearances indicated that Democrats and Republicans are busy talking, deploying internet memes against each other that have raised concerns about whether it's possible to negotiate in good faith.

Vice President JD Vance said a video putting Jeffries in a sombrero and thick mustache was simply a joke, even though it came across as mocking people of Mexican descent as Republicans insist that the Democratic demands would lead to health care spending on immigrants in the country illegally, a claim that Democrats dispute.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for any federal health care programs, including insurance provided through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. Still, hospitals do receive Medicaid reimbursements for emergency care that they are obligated to provide to people who meet other Medicaid eligibility requirements but do not have an eligible immigration status.

The challenge, however, is that the two parties do not appear to be having productive conversations with each other in private, even as Republicans insist they are in conversation with their Democratic colleagues.

On Friday, a Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed to notch the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. Johnson said the House would close for legislative business next week, a strategy that could obligate the Senate to work with the government funding bill that was passed by House Republicans.

""Johnson's not serious about this,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on CBS. ""He sent all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate?""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday that the shutdown on discretionary spending, the furloughing of federal workers and requirements that other federal employees work without pay will go on so long as Democrats vote no.

""They'll get another chance on Monday to vote again,"" Thune said on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

“Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” Vice President JD Vance said Sept. 28 on “Fox News Sunday.”

President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Republican members of Congress have repeated this line.

It’s wrong.

Democrats have refused to vote for Republicans’ resolution to extend the federal spending deadline, and their position does, in part, hinge on health care spending. Democrats want to extend covid pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid cuts in the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law this summer.

The Democrats’ proposal wouldn’t give health care to immigrants who lack legal status; that population is already largely ineligible for federally funded health care. Instead, the proposal would restore access to certain health care programs for legally present immigrants who will lose access under the Republican law.

The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment for this fact check. Vance addressed criticism of his talking point in another interview by saying it was included in the Democrats’ spending proposal. It’s not.

A White House X account followed up with screenshots of the Democratic proposal repealing a section of the Republican law labeled “alien Medicaid eligibility.” It’s important to know that these changes would not give Medicaid access to immigrants who lack lawful status.

Vance defended his statement again in an Oct. 1 White House press conference, saying former President Joe Biden “waived away illegal immigration status” that helped migrants access federal assistance. It’s important to note that many people granted lawful status through humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status programs don’t automatically qualify for Medicaid; TPS recipients aren’t eligible, and many people who entered the U.S. on humanitarian parole are required to wait five years before accessing it.

The Trump administration has ended humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status for many people, rendering them ineligible for Medicaid and health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

We did not find evidence that Democrats want to spend “hundreds of billions” in costs for insuring migrants with unlawful presence.

Immigrants Lacking Legal Status Are Already Ineligible

Most federal health care dollars cannot be spent on health care for people in the U.S. who lack legal status. They cannot enroll in Medicaid or Medicare, and they are ineligible to purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. A small Medicaid program reimburses hospitals for uninsured emergency care, which can include immigrants in the country without authorization but is not exclusive to them.

States such as California and Illinois expanded Medicaid coverage for people regardless of their immigration status, and the states pay for that. Federal law already banned states from using federal money for these programs. An earlier version of the Republican spending law would have penalized such states by withholding funding, but that provision didn’t last.

People in the country without permission might receive some federally funded health care in emergency cases; in those situations, hospitals must provide care even if a person is uninsured or in the country illegally. Emergency Medicaid covers hospital care for immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. The Republican tax and spending law reduced the amount hospitals can receive for emergency immigrant care.

Most Emergency Medicaid spending is used on childbirth. In all, it represented less than 1% of total Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2023, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

GOP Law Limited Care Access for Immigrants With Legal Status

The Republican tax and spending law made several changes to health care eligibility for immigrants living in the country with permission. An estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants are expected to lose their health insurance, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office projections.

Starting October 2026, the law will restrict eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to lawfully permanent residents, people from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, or Palau who lawfully reside in the U.S. under an international agreement, and certain Cubans and Haitians.

Previously, a broad group, described as “qualified noncitizens,” was eligible for Medicaid and its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, including refugees and people granted asylum.

Some immigrants eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, such as lawful permanent residents, are required to wait five years before accessing the benefits.

The law also limited Affordable Care Act marketplace eligibility to the same group eligible for Medicaid and CHIP beginning Jan. 1, 2027. Previously, people who were described as “lawfully present” were eligible. That group included the “qualified noncitizens” eligible for Medicaid and people with short-term statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status or international students.

Beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, for immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization as children were previously eligible for Affordable Care Act coverage and its subsidies. They are ineligible since a Trump administration rule took effect in August.

Democrats’ Proposal Would Restore Legal Immigrants’ Access

The Democrats’ Sept. 17 budget proposal would, in part, permanently extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back billions in Republican cuts to Medicaid and other health programs.

The change would make Medicaid, CHIP, and Affordable Care Act coverage available to all legal immigrants who were previously eligible for it, such as refugees and people granted asylum.

The Democratic proposal would not broaden eligibility to federally funded health care programs to immigrants lacking legal status.

Vance said the Democratic policies would “give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” and the White House did not offer its source for that figure. When Johnson was pressed to support a similar talking point, he referenced the Congressional Budget Office. The KFF analysis of CBO estimates found that the Republican law’s provisions related to legal immigrants would reduce federal spending by $131 billion; this projection did not include an estimate for people without legal status.

Our Ruling

Vance said, “Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are largely ineligible for the federally funded health care programs Medicare and Medicaid, and they cannot seek coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace or apply for subsidies.

The Democrats’ budget proposal would not change that.

The Democrats want to restore access to certain health care programs to legal immigrants who will lose access under the Republican tax and spending law — among other measures aimed at making Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance plans easier to keep.

Their proposal would not grant federally supported health care benefits to people in the U.S. illegally, because they did not have access to them in the first place. The small amount of funding designated for Emergency Medicaid reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care to immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Finally, we did not find evidence for Vance’s assertion that Democrats want “hundreds of billions” in health benefits for migrants in the country illegally.

NICK EICHER, HOST: It’s Monday the 6th of October.

Glad to have you along for today’s edition of The World and Everything in It. Good morning, I’m Nick Eicher.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: And I’m Mary Reichard.

This is not just any old Monday. This is the first Monday in October, when the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court return to the bench for a new term.

EICHER: Here on Legal Docket, that’s a little like opening day in baseball, except it’s the playoffs, so it’s more like the opening faceoff for a new hockey season, but I digress.

What the First Monday brings is a fresh slate of cases and controversies, many that will bring rulings that will affect our daily lives.

REICHARD: Starting next week, we’ll have coverage of oral arguments so you can hear directly from the lawyers and justices. But today we’re looking ahead at some of the bigger disputes already on the docket.

EICHER: And for that, we’ve brought in all the senior partners in the firm Reichard, Rough, and West—WORLD’s legal reporters Jenny Rough and Steve West join us. Good morning to you both.

All three of the lawyers have prepared three cases each, matters they’ll be following closely this term.

REICHARD: So let’s get started. Jenny has the first case for us.

EICHER: She does. First up, Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections. This one involves the dreadlocks an inmate wears, or rather the dreadlocks he used to wear. Dreadlocks that were cut off against his will. The question is whether he can sue prison officials for damages under federal religious-liberty law. Jenny, what happened here, and why is this before the U.S. Supreme Court?

JENNY ROUGH: Damon Landor is a practicing Rastafari, so he took the Nazirite vow to not cut his hair. But as you mentioned, the prison officials cut it anyway. And the statute at play is known as RLUIPA, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Now there’s no circuit split in this case. Circuit courts have consistently said an inmate cannot sue individual prison officials for money damages under the federal law. But there is a Supreme Court case about a sister statute that has identical wording in its relief provision that says such lawsuits are allowed. So the court is going to have to thread that needle.

EICHER: If the Court were to side with Landor here, Jenny—if it opens the door to damages—how big could that be for other inmates?

ROUGH: Well, it could expand an inmate’s ability to sue under this federal law, but the law does fall within a certain context. But it would certainly be a strong deterrent to prison officials.

EICHER: Alright, number two Trump v. Slaughter. President Trump fired the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, and he fired her without giving a reason. Federal law says commissioners can only be removed for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance. So could you lay the facts out in this one..

ROUGH: Well, the president, as the head of the executive branch, has very broad powers to remove members of the executive branch. But as you mentioned, there’s a federal law, the Federal Trade Commission Act, that says a commissioner can only be removed for specific reasons. And Slaughter argues her removal was unlawful because none of those reasons existed.

EICHER: So I understand a lot of the case law here goes way back to the 1930s when the size of government really exploded.

ROUGH: Yeah, ninety years ago, the Supreme Court decided Humphrey’s Executor versus the United States. In a very similar set of facts, President Franklin D. Roosevelt fired Federal Trade Commissioner William Humphrey because Humphrey didn’t agree with the president’s policies. But the Court held that the president couldn’t do that because of the statute.

And the rationale at the time was that the commission’s job wasn’t purely executive. It included quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial tasks.

So jumping forward to the current case, the court wants answers to two questions: Does the federal statute’s removal protections violate the separation of powers? And if so, does Humphrey’s Executor need to be overturned?

But either way, it seems like the court will look at the role of the FTC and how it has changed over the years.

EICHER: Alright, Jenny, well the third one is Case v. Montana. In this one, police entered a man’s home without a warrant after a welfare call. So it’s a little bit different. He says that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. So could you walk us through how this case unfolded.

ROUGH: Yeah, and just a real quick reminder, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. And it says search warrants must be based on probable cause. But there are exceptions.

So, it was actually William Cases’ ex-girlfriend called the police. She was on the phone with Case when she heard a pop and then silence, and he had been threatening suicide. So the police went to his house. Nobody answered. They entered. Case stepped out of a closet holding a dark object in his outstretched arm. And an officer shot him in the abdomen. And the dark object was a gun. So Case was arrested for assaulting a peace officer, but he now wants the gun and other evidence suppressed, saying police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by entering his house without a warrant.

So the question here is what standard applies for this emergency aid exception to getting a warrant. The traditional standard is probable cause that an emergency was unfolding, or is it a lesser standard like reasonable suspicion?

EICHER: So I guess, too, whether it makes a difference that this wasn’t a criminal investigation, but rather just a welfare check? That’s pretty key I would imagine.

ROUGH: That is such an interesting question, and it flags a tension that makes this case so hard. If police had been investigating Case for a crime, they would have needed probable cause. But because they were supposedly helping, they’re arguing the standard is lower. The Court has long said the home is entitled to the highest level of protection. So it kind of begs the question: Why would a criminal be entitled to greater protection than a person who needs help?

So the justices are going to have to wrestle with protecting the sanctity of the home, but at the same time, wanting police to be able to enter a house when a life is in danger.

EICHER: All right, Jenny, thanks so much time now to turn to Steve West. He's been watching several cases with First Amendment and executive power themes. Steve first up for you, Chiles v. Salazar. Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls “conversion therapy.”

Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls conversion therapy. So in this one, we see a Christian counselor saying that the state ban violates her free-speech rights because it allows therapists to affirm same-sex attraction or affirm a gender transition, but not to question any of those things. So talk a bit about that for us, Steve.

STEVE WEST: Well, Nick, the law actually says that it prohibits mental-health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, and that includes simply talking to a person that attempts or purports to change their minds about their sexual orientation or gender identity. So it’s like a lot of other laws that have proliferated around the country, whether they’re passed by states or local municipalities or counties.

It’s a speech ban. You can help an individual explore and even affirm their same-sex attraction or a gender not matching their sex, but you can’t help them become comfortable in their own sex or cope with their same-sex attraction.

So Kaleigh Chiles—she’s the counselor here—says this is a free-speech issue, that this is a ban of certain speech not approved by the state, whereas other speech is approved by the state. So it’s focused on the content of speech and therefore violates her free-speech rights.

EICHER: Well, there’s a pretty direct tie from this one to the next case, Steve—going from free speech and counseling to free speech and association in a different context, pro-life ministry.

This one is First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin. New Jersey’s attorney general had subpoenaed a pro-life pregnancy center, demanding donor lists and demanding internal records. The center says this is a clear violation of its First Amendment rights. So what is the state after here?

WEST: Yeah, first of all, just to clarify, the subpoena issued by the attorney general is an investigatory subpoena. It’s not a court subpoena. So it doesn’t have any power, in and of itself, to force the pro-life ministry here to disclose the identities of its donors or their other information—their names and addresses and that kind of thing.

So he has to go to court—state court—in order to get an order enforcing it, which is what the attorney general has done. And also, the pro-life ministry here has gone to federal court at the same time and asked for an order barring the state from getting this information.

And the federal court has deferred to the state and said the issue is not yet ripe for consideration, that you can certainly litigate your claims in state court. So what the case is about is which court can we be in, rather than the constitutional issue at this point at least.

EICHER: Well, Steve, Jenny had a case on presidential power, and you do too. This last one for you is Learning Resources v. Trump.

Two family-owned toy companies in this one are challenging tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They argue that Congress gave too much trade authority over to the President. So, Steve, go through the facts here for us

WEST: Yeah, these are two companies that import educational toys that are made in China and a few other countries that are affected by tariffs. The Constitution says Congress can assess tariffs, but Congress has also delegated some of that authority to the executive branch through this International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

And so it authorizes the President to take action to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States if he declares a national emergency—which is what President Trump has done in this case.

EICHER: And so on top of everything, it’s on an expedited schedule.

WEST: It is. It'll be heard In November—pretty quickly.

EICHER: Yeah, all right. Well, questions of free speech, donor privacy, and executive power. Steve, thank you very much.

WEST: You’re welcome.

EICHER:Well, Mary, you’ve been looking at three more cases, starting with a pair of them on women’s sports.

First up, West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox.

So what are these about? I thought we’d settled these women’s-sports questions.

These two could answer some of the questions left open by the recent Skrmetti decision, right? (And while you’re at it, remind us what Skrmetti was about.)

REICHARD: Well, we haven’t. These two cases come out of West Virginia—obviously for one of them—the other one comes out of Idaho, which was the first state to pass laws protecting women’s sports and reserving female sports for females. There is a court split about whether those laws are constitutional. But this really is a big deal because twenty-seven states have something similar to the laws in these two states also protecting women’s sports.

EICHER: All right, so these two could answer some of the questions, I guess, left open by the recent Skrmetti decision. And maybe while you’re at it, tell us what Skrmetti was all about.

REICHARD: Yeah, be glad to. That was a six-to-three ruling that upheld Tennessee’s law banning medical intervention on minors suffering from gender dysphoria. So this is a really big deal affecting all those other states, and there is a court split whether these laws protecting women’s sports are constitutional, which is one reason SCOTUS took the case in the first place. And then one issue that remains is whether the “T” in the LGBT is a protected class, and that is hugely important.

EICHER: All right, so the justices here are going to have to decide what standard applies—what legal standard—whether it’s strict scrutiny or something else.

REICHARD: Yeah, bingo. You can recall we have three levels of scrutiny. We have rational-basis, which is really easy to meet; intermediate, a little bit harder; and then, as you say, strict scrutiny, which is the most difficult to overcome. And what classification we’re talking about determines which level of scrutiny we use. So here the justices will have to decide which level applies.

EICHER: Okay, so we have sports, we have equal protection, we’ve got money in elections—another perennial topic for the Court.

This one is National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC, the Federal Election Commission. It’s a campaign-finance case about how much coordination is permitted between political parties and their candidates.

So how are the Republicans framing up the argument here?

REICHARD: Well, like a lot of cases, it’s money, money, money. That’s what this is about. And the Republicans are arguing that this is a First Amendment-violation case. They say, “Hey, why limit parties like that when we have super PACs without any spending limits at all?” Political parties and candidates can coordinate their spending. There are limits in the law about how much you can donate to a campaign individually. So that’s what the Republicans say—that makes no sense at all.

EICHER:All right, your final case, Mary. It has to do with immigration and asylum.

This one is Urias-Orellana v. Bondi. That’s Pam Bondi, the attorney general. A man from El Salvador here fled after gang violence killed two of his brothers and threatened the rest of his family. He entered the U.S. He asked for asylum.

So walk us through this case. What is the Court being asked to decide

REICHARD: Yeah, it’s a technical legal question, and that is whether appellate judges have to defer to immigration courts on what persecution means under the law, or can appellate judges decide for themselves if the facts are indeed persecution. So it has a very particular meaning. We just don’t know what it is yet.

EICHER: So ultimately this dispute is over who makes the final call here, whether it’s an immigration judge or an appellate court.

REICHARD: That’s right, and we get a lot of cases like that. The facts are pretty dazzling, but the technical legal question—not so much. And this is one of them.

EICHER: All right, and that is this week’s Legal Docket. Jenny Rough, thank you.

ROUGH: Thank you. That was fun.

EICHER: And Steve West, thank you too.

WEST: Thanks Nick.

World citizenship, as the highest level of allegiance, empowers us to focus on equity, justice, sustainability, unity, and harmony with each other and the Earth.","More than 120 million people have been displaced from their homes due to war, climate change, political instability, and oppression in the past few years, a figure that has doubled in the last decade. Millions more are living in vulnerable situations as stateless individuals, frequently unable to exercise even their most basic rights.

The population of displaced persons is larger than that of more than 220 countries and dependent territories. In other words, only 12 countries in the world have a population larger than 120 million people. As the UN High Commissioner for Refugees explains, “one out of every 67 people on the Earth” is displaced from their homes. More than “20 people are forced to flee every minute of every day” according to the International Rescue Committee. These figures do not even account for the day-to-day oppression that millions, if not billions, face but who are unable or reluctant to leave to seek a safe haven.

Most refugees in the world are either internally displaced in or are fleeing from the following countries: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen.

As violence, war, and climate destruction affect more countries and regions of the world, the growing numbers of refugees and migrants could put a strain on social systems. National governments have responded to immigration flows in different ways, some limiting immigrants from entering their claimed territories and others welcoming newcomers. Just five countries — Iran, Turkey, Colombia, Germany, and Uganda — have welcomed almost 40% of the world’s refugees and others fleeing persecution and war.

The nation-state system has created the “refugee” and “stateless person,” as well as the severe problems associated with being considered outside the law or without “legal” status. All human beings are legal and have rights that should be respected wherever they live. Yet, due to violations of their human rights frequently perpetuated by or ignored by national governments, thousands of people flee their homes and countries every day trying to find safety, stability, and asylum.

By dividing up the world into 200 or so different countries, we have created “in” and “out” groups, with some achieving dignity, acceptance, inclusion, and rights fulfillment, and others being treated as less than human, unable to meet their basic daily needs. This disparity of treatment destabilizes society.

Why should our fellow humans have to flee to have their rights and basic needs upheld? Why are millions stuck in refugee camps with inadequate food, housing, healthcare, education, and opportunity?

To have the kind of world in which the rights reaffirmed in various declarations and treaties such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights are fully met, we should all be able to claim, and then exercise, our rights no matter where we happen to live on the planet. Human rights and duties are not bound by territory; they are not dependent upon the nation-state in which one happens to be born or where one happens to live.

Human rights are innate and unalienable; we are born with them, and we cannot give them up. We have them simply by being human.

What if we were to claim a citizenship that inherently affirms our rights wherever we find ourselves on planet Earth?

If everyone had citizenship everywhere, statelessness would no longer exist, and only natural disasters would forcibly displace people. With world citizenship, if we do not like where we live, if we do not like the politics or the rulers, then we could choose to live somewhere else, rather than being forced to flee for our safety and livelihood.

World citizenship, as a valid and legal citizenship beyond any other status that someone may carry, would ensure that everyone has at least one citizenship which, in its inclusiveness, upholds our concomitant rights and duties.

Requiring all governments to respect world citizenship status legally is the next step – a step that will support millions of displaced persons, by ensuring that governments will begin to fulfill their obligations to respect refugees, stateless and displaced persons’ innate and unalienable rights. To promote respect for this highest citizenship status, global institutions of law, such as a World Court of Human Rights and a World Parliament of the people, must be established.

World citizenship, as the highest level of allegiance, empowers us to focus on equity, justice, sustainability, unity, and harmony with each other and the Earth.

As long as we, the people of the world, allow the nation-state system to maintain the arbitrary and exclusive borders that divide humans from one another, immigration will continue to be viewed as a problem rather than as an educational, economic, political, and social opportunity. When we respect each other, our rights and duties, as world citizens, the entire earth will be a sanctuary of peace and safety for all.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salah-darwish-hgS8njCYwP8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 02:56:25.836199

The ECHR and the Human Rights Act make little difference and the numbers relying on them are small.","This is the final of a series of articles from the Society of Labour Lawyers outlining the arguments and issues around the UK’s relationship with the European Convention on Human Rights. You can read the first here and the second here.

Why are the ECHR and Human Rights Act relevant to immigration? I thought they were just supposed to protect citizens, not foreigners with no right to be here.

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act apply to everyone, even asylum-seekers. However, they are not the first thing to which people turn to know where they stand. Just as fair trial rights existed for us in our common law before appearing in the Human Rights Act, so asylum policy is set by the UK government, with the Human Rights Act acting as a backstop check to make sure we have got it right.

The UK, as a liberal democratic state with the rule of law, does not tolerate torture or inhuman treatment. Our criminal law protects us from such things and we can bring civil claims against anyone who harms us like that. We don’t deport people to places where they will be tortured either. It’s part of our values. The Human Rights Act reinforces those values but does not create them.

READ MORE: What has the European Convention on Human Rights ever done for us?

The same goes for British citizens wanting to be joined by their foreign national family members such as a spouse or children. It’s our Home Office that sets immigration policy and can reject applications using the strong, muscular, definition of the public interest that Parliament provides. The ECHR and the Human Rights Act make little difference and the numbers relying on them are small. The rare cases that succeed usually involve British family members that need care or looking after. Even then, a foreign national with a criminal record may be refused in the public interest.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA mean that people wanting to come to the UK, or who have landed on small boats with dodgy asylum claims, or who are here illegally, can get round the immigration rules?

No. There are tough rules in place that ensure that people who cross the Channel may be sent back to France to have their asylum claims determined there. The new UK-France Treaty on preventing dangerous journeys means that France has to take them back when the UK asks. Those asylum-seekers that remain here get their claims processed here because like all democratic states in Europe, we abide by the Refugee Convention. We don’t send people back to counties where they face persecution or torture. Like all European democracies we are signed up not only to the ECHR but to the big UN global treaties on this as well.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA stop us deporting foreigners who have committed serious crimes because their child would miss chicken nuggets or because life is a bit tough back home?

No. The public interest dominates consideration of these issues by the Home Office and immigration judges. Where a UK-resident British citizen has a foreign national spouse or child and aspires to live with them in the UK there are demanding conditions, including a high-income threshold to be satisfied. Presently, an income of £29,000 is required to apply to bring in a spouse. Family life human rights provide a backstop for the small, residual number of hard cases or unusual cases for which the rules – being general in nature – make no provision.

There are also some cases concerning foreign nationals convicted of criminal offences who stand to be deported from the UK. Some of them seek to resist deportation as they have UK-resident family members, again typically, a British citizen spouse or child. It is these cases that tend to get media attention. In fact, Home Office policy and appeals law define the public interest at such a high level that almost all foreign national criminal claims fail.

Parliament has said in law that the deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest. It also states that the more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater the public interest in the deportation of that person. Foreign nationals given prison sentences on conviction face very high hurdles. Without a British citizen family member with care needs or who needs looking after, for whom it would be unjustifiably harsh or who has very compelling circumstances, foreign national criminals have very little chance of success. A case that might succeed is where a sick British citizen child needs her foreign national parent to look after her.

The numbers who succeed in an immigration appeal are tiny. A 2025 Bonavero Institute report estimates that the number of deportation appeals won on family life human rights grounds is about 2.5% of those deported. In the 15 months to June 2021 only 45 deportation appeals were allowed by an immigration tribunal on human rights grounds. That is not very many.

READ MORE: ‘Quitters never win – the problems with leaving the ECHR’

Great caution should be taken when reading media reports of a dislike of foreign chicken nuggets or an affection for a pet being the central issue in any cases. If such matters sound like a fantastical basis for deciding an immigration appeal, that is because in reality immigration appeals are not won on such grounds.

Didn’t the ECHR/HRA stop the Tories’ Rwanda plans? Could it stop Labour’s returns deal with France?

No. France is not Rwanda. Human Rights law stopped removal to Rwanda as there was a risk of the asylum seekers sent there being sent on to their home country where was a risk of ill-treatment or torture. The Labour government’s scheme to transfer asylum-seekers to France under the 2025 UK-France Agreement does not face the same hurdles. Like the UK, France applies ECHR human rights. It is also bound by EU asylum laws. Asylum-seekers in France can seek protection from French courts.

Aren’t appeals to the Strasbourg Court a way in which lawyers representing clients with dodgy cases can frustrate and spin out the process?

No. UK immigration cases barely feature there. UK domestic tribunals are where immigration cases end in all but a literal handful of cases. There is a right of petition to Strasbourg once domestic remedies have been exhausted. However, the chances of a successful outcome are miniscule. Only a small number of applications are made. Of those, the vast majority are filtered out at the admission stage, for example as being manifestly ill-founded.

In the tiny number of cases that progress to a full hearing, the UK government mostly wins. Since 1980 there have been only 29 UK deportation cases decided by the Strasbourg Court, of which the UK won 16. The reality is that the Strasbourg Court’s judgments make little difference.

If we left the ECHR and scrapped the HRA wouldn’t we be able to deport anyone we decided shouldn’t be here without pesky courts getting in the way?

No, it’s not that easy. There are other impediments such as the high cost of immigration detention and removal, the problems of documenting and securing the identity and nationality of persons, the role of our common law in fundamental rights protection, and the lack of effective re-admission co-operation by home states.

The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat at odds with the Trump administration, says the state officers are simply keeping protesters safe from overzealous feds while protecting their First Amendment rights. But some demonstrators say Illinois troopers are now effectively shielding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement outpost in suburban Broadview.

Previously, disruptors have blocked access to the ICE facility, prompting federal authorities to use crowd-control methods, such as tear gas, to disperse mobs. Over the weekend, the Illinois State Police has been moving crowds back with wooden batons, herding them behind concrete barriers that are meant to keep the street clear.

Protesters like Ranell Conine told NewsNation they are confused by the disconnect between Pritzker’s public comments about the Trump administration and his use of state police to protect ICE.

“I think (Pritzker) needs to come and see the way that citizens are being treated and the way that our right to protest is being oppressed and challenged,” she said on Saturday.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said state authorities are not hiding behind masks in Broadview, in contrast with federal agents.

“They show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois,” the spokesperson said.

Tory plans announced on Sunday would see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

The proposal is modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which the Conservatives said had provided a “successful approach” in removing illegal immigrants.

But ICE has also been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and US citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan” announced at the start of the party’s annual conference on Sunday.

Immigration is set to be one of the key themes of the annual gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre in Manchester.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system which would see refugee status granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants and arguing there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The plan follows the Tories’ announcement that they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it won the next election, arguing the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

It also comes as Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – that has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/1eAGm5cXqvdfm19D55VGfq/c056372af97df1cc03062fac2deb6384/PA-81876547.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:52.798489

Gavin Newsom (D) said and the White House confirmed Sunday.

The big picture: The move, which Newsom says he'll sue over, comes the day after a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's deployment of Oregon troops, saying the government had failed to prove immigration-related protests in the area couldn't be handled by local law enforcement.

The latest: While Newsom said 300 California National Guard members would be deployed, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told Axios Sunday evenining that about 200 troops would be sent from the state to Portland.

They're ""being reassigned from duty in the greater Los Angeles area"" to the city to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ""and other federal personnel performing official duties, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" he said.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield (D) said the state is ""preparing to take legal action"" over the move.

Driving the news: State and local officials have slammed Trump's directive to send federal troops into the city as unnecessary and dangerous.

Newsom said in a Sunday statement that the personnel are on their way now, calling the administration's action ""a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.""

""This isn't about public safety, it's about power,"" Newsom's statement continued. ""The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens.""

However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to Axios: ""President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.""

Friction point: The bitter feud between Trump and the California governor was escalated this summer when the president mobilized thousands of Guard troops and hundreds of Marines in response to Los Angeles-area protests.

Earlier this year, Trump also sent Guard personnel into Washington, D.C. He'd repeatedly teased sending troops to Chicago — before eventually moving Saturday to call up 300 National Guard members in Illinois.

Catch up quick: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, on Saturday granted a temporary restraining order that halted the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to Portland.

She noted in her order that the ""protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days—or even weeks—leading up to the President's directive"" and said Trump's ""determination was simply untethered to the facts.""

Soon after, the administration filed a notice of appeal to challenge the decision.

Local officials have pushed back on the administration's characterization of what's happened at demonstrations at a South Portland facility, saying they've been relatively small and easily handled by local police, Axios' Kale Williams reported.

What they're saying: Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said in a statement that her administration is aware of 101 Guard members who arrived in Oregon Saturday night and that they believed more were on the way Sunday. She added she had yet to receive any official notification from the federal government.

""The facts haven't changed,"" her statement read. ""There is no need for military intervention in Oregon. There is no insurrection in Portland.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said the administration's move ""circumvents the court's decision and threatens to inflame a community that has remained peaceful.""

The other side: Trump on Sunday said Immergut ""ought to be ashamed.""

He told reporters outside of the White House, ""I appointed the judge, and he goes like that."" Immergut is a woman.

Pritzker’s directive was issued Friday after reports emerged that armed federal immigration agents descended on an apartment building on the South Side of Chicago on September 30 and pulled men, women, and children from their beds in the middle of the night.

In an interview with CNN Sunday, the governor cited reports of “children who were zip-tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” At least one U.S. citizen was detained, Pritzker added.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker added.

Witnesses told WBEZ Chicago and the Chicago Sun Times that armed agents arrived at the five-story building with U-Hauls and broke down residents’ doors, dragging them out of bed. Some told CNN that a Black Hawk helicopter was flying above the apartment complex.

“Imagine being a child awakened in the middle of the night by a Black Hawk helicopter landing in your neighborhood,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Imagine an armed stranger forcibly removing you from your bed, zip-tying your hands, separating you from your family, and detaining you in a dark van for hours. This didn’t happen in a country with an authoritarian regime – it happened here in Chicago.”

Pritzker said he was “appalled” by the reports and that “military-style tactics should never be used on children.”

The Independent has asked the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Federal agents and officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives were involved in the immigration raid. Authorities said the neighborhood where the raid was conducted was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates.”

Eboni Watson, a resident of the building, told WLS that children appeared “terrified” during the raid.

“The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught,” Watson said.

“I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” Watson added.

Approximately 37 people were arrested in the September 30 raid, some of whom had criminal records related to drug or weapons crimes, DHS said.

Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.","President Donald Trump’s clash with Oregon escalated after about 100 California National Guard members were deployed to the Pacific Northwest state, despite a court order holding that isolated protests in Portland did not justify the use of federalized troops.

The troops arrived Saturday night with no prior notice to state officials, and more troops are on the way, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek said in a statement Sunday.

Oregon officials said they were going to return to federal court Monday because the 14-day restraining order from US District Judge Karin Immergut only stopped the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops. The state’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a news conference that California was joining Oregon’s lawsuit to stop the deployment of the California Guard.

Troops were ordered to Illinois in a similar manner.

Rayfield and Kotek told reporters they hoped US District Judge Karin Immergut would rule Monday on their request, which is the same day the Trump administration is appealing her Saturday ruling.

“The president is trying to out-hustle us” in this process, Rayfield said.

The Trump administration has said that federalized troops are needed to protect immigration officers from protesters in Democratic-run cities, even as local officials said demonstrations have been modest and largely peaceful.

“There is no need for military intervention in Oregon,” Kotek said in the statement. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. Oregon is our home, not a military target.”

The move marks another dramatic escalation in Trump’s campaign to federalize law enforcement in Democratic cities, with his administration now trying to find ways around federal court orders. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis, with varying goals of protecting federal property and fighting crime.

Protests in Portland began in June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started arresting undocumented immigrants as they appeared in court for procedural hearings. The sporadic protests have focused on a single ICE facility outside downtown, a far cry from the often violent protests that rocked Portland during social-justice protests in 2020.

Nevertheless, Trump called Portland “war-ravaged” and said Sunday the city was “burning to the ground.”

Kotek countered that description on Sunday, noting that the protest was confined to one city block and that the Portland Marathon had occurred that day.

“Thousands of people running 26 miles through the streets of Portland — clearly not a war zone,” she said. “We cannot normalize the approach he is taking with the military in our country.”

The deployment of California troops to Oregon came hours after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Portland issued a strongly worded court order temporarily blocking the administration’s plan to call up 200 Oregon National Guard members to the state’s largest city.

Immergut concluded there was no justification for the deployment. She cited the limited nature of the protests and the ability of local law enforcement to handle the situation, which typically involved about 20 protesters at a time in recent weeks. The judge also said that the deployment risks “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request to confirm the deployment, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Sunday that the federal government expects to win its appeal of the Portland judge’s order.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Jackson said. California Governor Gavin Newsom, she said, “should stand on the side of law-abiding citizens instead of violent criminals destroying Portland and cities across the country.”

Rayfield said Trump is falsely portraying Portland as a war zone to justify sending in federalized troops.

“This president is obviously hellbent on deploying the military in American cities, absent facts or authority to do so,” Rayfield said earlier in a statement. “It is up to us and the courts to hold him accountable. That’s what we intend to do.”

Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.

“Despite a federal court order finding no legal basis to deploy state National Guard troops to the streets of Portland and ordering that control of the Oregon National Guard be returned to state command, the Trump administration is now sending 300 federally controlled members of the California National Guard to Portland to take their place,” Newsom said in a statement.

The judge said there were no facts to support Trump’s claims that Portland was “war-ravaged” and that anarchists and professional agitators were trying to burn down federal property and other buildings.

“The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

Immergut agreed that courts should give great deference to the president in making such decisions, but she disagreed that Trump had made his determination about Portland in good faith and ruled that deference “is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

Trump also ordered 300 National Guard troops to Illinois on Saturday on a similar rationale, over the objections of Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, who called the move “un-American.”

Illinois received no prior notice from the White House about the deployment, said a Pritzker spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesperson added that the Illinois National Guard informed the Pentagon that the situation does not require the use of the military and reiterated its objection to the deployment.

The California National Guard was federalized in June for 90 days, when Trump first started using military troops to help combat what he claims is high crime and to protect federal agents carrying out his deportation actions. Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.

The Memphis deployment was conducted with the agreement of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December.
It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.
If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement?
There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.","WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY Karoline Leavitt on Thursday got a question she didn’t seem prepared to answer, about a law she may not have expected to be discussing.

It is known as EMTALA, which stands for the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. If you’ve ever been sitting in an emergency room, staring at the walls, you may have seen one of the posters explaining EMTALA’s guarantee: Hospitals must provide stabilizing or life-saving care to anybody who needs it, no matter who they are or whether they can pay.

The law has been on the books since the 1980s. And although EMTALA pops up in political fights from time to time, there was no reason to think it’d become a major subplot of the government shutdown story. But then the shutdown turned into an argument over health care policy.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December. Trump and the Republicans are not inclined to take either step. And to get the public on their side, they’ve been arguing the real Democratic agenda is different—that, as Vice President JD Vance posted on X Thursday, “Democrats shut down the government to give health care money to illegal aliens.”

The problem for Republicans is that most of the Democratic demands have nothing to do with immigration, while the portion that does deals almost entirely with people here lawfully. As critics have called out the lie, Vance and his allies have retreated to a narrower argument about one tiny item on the list of cuts Democrats would reverse. It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.

EMTALA is the reason hospitals have to provide that care in the first place, so it was only a matter of time before Leavitt got the query she faced Thursday. If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement? Or, as the NBC News reporter who asked the question put it: “Should ERs check immigration status before treating a dying patient?”

“That’s probably not a question for me to answer,” Leavitt responded. “That’s a question for health care professionals and legal experts to answer.”

But it was a perfectly appropriate question for Leavitt, as it would have been for Vance or for any other Republican who used Emergency Medicaid funding as a cudgel against the Democrats last week. There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.

Evidence was put forward in the initial tribunal hearing that the father and son had a very close relationship, that the son had special needs and was emotionally fragile, and, in a long list of reasons why the boy would struggle to cope if moved to Albania, his mother mentioned that small changes to his food causes him to “seize up” and refuse to eat. A specific example was given by the mother that the boy refuses to eat the type of chicken nuggets available abroad.

• A sitting ovation for Kemi Badenoch, but they stood up for Philp

The judge in the first-tier tribunal considered the impact that either separation from his father or moving to Albania would have on the boy, set out the arguments on which he placed weight (making no explicit reference to chicken nuggets) and concluded that deportation of the father involved a breach of the son’s ECHR rights.

In other words, the idea that deportation was refused simply because of a child’s aversion to chicken nuggets was always misleading. Except even that is far from being the whole story. The Home Office appealed against the decision and won: the upper-tier tribunal rejected the conclusion that there was a breach of the boy’s Article 8 rights at all.

It was only after this second judgment was published that the so-called chicken nuggets case attracted attention as an example of how the ECHR stopped deportations — even though the case was never about chicken nuggets and, by the time it was being reported, the finding against deportation had been overturned.

When a judgment in one of these cases sounds too bad to be true, it probably isn’t true. As with the case above, a first-tier tribunal decision might be reported even though it has been overturned. A detail from the case might be presented as decisive when it was merely incidental. Another area of misleading reporting is when an argument made by the person facing deportation (or their lawyer) is quoted as being the basis of a judicial decision even if it is not.

• Russell Findlay backs Badenoch’s call to leave ECHR

A better way of assessing whether the ECHR is an impediment to an effective deportation regime is to look at the data. A recent academic study by the University of Oxford did precisely that. It found that the latest available Home Office statistics show the number of successful human rights-based appeals against deportation is very small compared with the number of foreign national offenders who are deported, at around 3.5 per cent (and some of those cases will have been overturned on appeal).

That is the evidence from the UK courts, but what about successful appeals to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg? Again, the data does not suggest that this is a serious impediment in deporting foreign national offenders. There have been 29 cases involving deportations from the UK heard by the Strasbourg court since 1980 and the UK has won 16 of them. None of the 13 defeats has been in the past five years.

We might still conclude, even though the oft-quoted cases about the problems caused by the ECHR are misleading and the data suggests this is a relatively small issue, that something must be done. It does not follow, however, that we must leave the ECHR. When it comes to interpreting the relevant ECHR articles, our courts consider guidance set out by parliament. The home secretary has set out her intention to tighten this guidance. Over a longer time frame, it may also be possible to work with others to reform the text of the ECHR.

Instead, the Conservatives have followed Reform UK into advocating full withdrawal. It is a policy that, at the very least, complicates the workings of the Good Friday agreement and our post-Brexit deal with the EU, results in us leaving the Council of Europe (following in the footsteps of Russia and Belarus), and leaves us more isolated, thereby making it harder to work with other European countries to tackle illegal immigration. Leaving the ECHR would be a high-risk policy, damaging to our international standing and, at best, irrelevant in tackling illegal immigration. That such a policy is justified by misleading and spurious claims only makes matters worse.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fad8f749f-3c01-414f-b922-7b0733d13ed6.jpg?crop=1214%2C683%2C219%2C122&resize=1200,N,,2025-10-05 19:56:32.840286

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.
Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said.
“If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so.
The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.","A future Tory government would be open to dismantling more treaties as a means to deport people from the UK, Kemi Badenoch has said at the start of a Conservative party conference focused almost exclusively on immigration policy.

Making the first of two addresses to the gathering in Manchester, the Tory leader formally set out her proposal for the UK to quit the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as part of a wider bonfire of protections including an end to legal aid in immigration and asylum cases and the right to take migration decisions to tribunals or judicial review.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.

Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said. “If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so. And we will do so in the same calm and responsible way, working out the detail before we rush to announce.”

The plan to leave the ECHR was announced just before the conference as part of a radical and sometimes draconian package of anti-migration measures including a pledge that all asylum seekers arriving by unofficial means would be sent to their own or a third country within a week.

Another plan involves the formation of a “removals force”, billed as being modelled on Donald Trump’s semi-militarised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, with a remit to deport 150,000 people a year.

In a speech directly after Badenoch, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that if a foreign national in the UK expressed “racial hatred, including antisemitism”, or supported “extremism or terrorism”, they would be deported.

It was not immediately clear whether this would apply only to people convicted of a crime for such actions. The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.

Unveiling the plan to leave the ECHR, Badenoch said this followed a review of the issue by Lord Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, who concluded the only feasible way to gain control of borders was to quit the treaty.

“And so to me and the shadow cabinet, the resulting policy decision is also clear,” she said. “We must leave the ECHR and repeal the Human Rights Act. Conference, I want you to know that the next Conservative manifesto will contain our commitment to leave.”

Badenoch said there would be “particular challenges in Northern Ireland”, where the ECHR is included in the Good Friday agreement. She said she would get Alex Burghart, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, “to examine this issue”.

The address contained no policies that had not been previously announced, with Badenoch repeating her mantra that the party needed to learn from its 2024 election defeat and take time to put together a cohesive platform.

“People won’t listen to us again unless we showed them we have learned from our mistakes and changed,” she said. Badenoch went on to take a swipe at Liz Truss’s mini-budget, saying: “We will never repeat the financial irresponsibility of spending commitments without saying where the money is coming from.”

Much of her conference speech and that of Philp’s were focused on migration, with the shadow home secretary in particular using large parts of his address to list a sequence of criminal offences committed by asylum seekers. “This is sick. We must do whatever it takes to end this madness,” Philp said.

He set out details of the new removals force, saying it would have twice the budget of the current system and be able to take advantage of the removal of many rights and avenues of appeal.

“Stripping away the legal obstacles, that I have described, and doubling that budget means we can remove 150,000 people a year that have no legal right to be here. That is three-quarters of a million over the course of the next parliament. This illegal immigration scandal will end.”

Badenoch took a similarly hard right tone in places, saying the UK had “tolerated the radical Islamist ideology” and that the country could not “import and tolerate values hostile to our own”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f2d65ab7cac70b499a2cae09abaaaf564fc2dd/3168_1621_5175_4139/master/5175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ec2182f87c469d572fab4d8353cfc71",N,,2025-10-05 17:56:40.253906

Johnson also said that Senate Democrats are the reason the government shut down, accusing them of seeking to fund emergency health services for undocumented immigrants.
And unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,” Jeffries told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker.
Before they left town in September, House Republicans passed a stopgap funding measure that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21.
Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday accused Senate Democrats of not being “serious” about negotiating an end to the government shutdown.

“They’re not serious. This is not a serious negotiation. They’re doing this to get political cover,” Johnson told NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of using the government shutdown as a ploy to help a future re-election bid.

Johnson also said that Senate Democrats are the reason the government shut down, accusing them of seeking to fund emergency health services for undocumented immigrants.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who appeared on “Meet the Press” just before Johnson, accused Republicans of being the driving force behind the ongoing government shutdown, saying that GOP leaders in Congress and President Donald Trump have gone “radio silent” in negotiations to reopen the government.

“The last time there was a conversation with Republican leadership was in the White House meeting last Monday. And unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,” Jeffries told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker.

“What we’ve seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes and, of course, President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That’s not responsible behavior,” the minority leader added, pointing to AI-generated videos Trump has posted online of his political foes, including Jeffries.

Later in the interview, Jeffries responded more directly to the president’s posts that included AI-generated images and videos of the minority leader, calling them “outrageous, “unhinged” and “unreasonable.”

“The American people deserve better than lies, than attacks, than deepfake videos,” he added.

Johnson’s and Jeffries’ comments come as the federal government is set to enter the sixth day of a government shutdown on Monday because Congress has not successfully appropriated the funds to keep it open.

In a separate interview Sunday on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cast doubt on the idea that the shutdown could end soon, saying it was up to Democrats to decide on the length of the shut down.

""I think it’s just as long as the Democrats want it to go on. I mean, they’re the ones — they have the control, the controlling card right now ... It’s simply, are the Democrats going to open up the government or aren’t they?” he said when asked about how long the shutdown could drag on.

Thune also said that he hopes ""reasonable"" Senate Democrats will vote alongside Republicans this week on a GOP-backed bill to reopen the government, but didn't name any Democrats who are leaning toward that.

""There are reasonable Democrats out there who are having conversations with Republicans, and I’m hopeful those are going to yield some results,” the majority leader added.

House lawmakers were set to return to Washington this week for the first time since Sept. 19, but late Friday, Johnson canceled the votes that were set to occur this week, labeling the week a district work period instead.

Republicans and Democrats are still at a stalemate in the Senate, which held votes Friday on a Democratic-backed plan and a Republican-backed plan to temporarily fund the government. Neither plan received the 60 votes needed to move forward.

Before they left town in September, House Republicans passed a stopgap funding measure that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. Just one House Democrat — Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine — joined his GOP colleagues in voting for that bill.

But that temporary funding bill has stalled in the Senate, where the bills have failed multiple times to clear the 60-vote threshold, with a majority of Democratic senators voting against it.

Johnson on Sunday pointed to those votes as the cause of the shutdown, telling Welker, “The reason the government is closed is because Chuck Schumer and 43 of his Democrat colleagues in the Senate have decided now to vote multiple times to keep the government closed. We need them to turn the lights back on so that everyone can do their work.”

“The House did our work,” Johnson added. “We passed a bipartisan, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open. And what did Chuck Schumer send back in response? His counterproposal would add $1.5 trillion in new spending for a simple seven-week stopgap funding measure to keep the government open.”

Senate Democrats have proposed their own temporary funding measure that would fund the government through Oct. 31. It would also restore previous GOP cuts to Medicaid and extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to give Medicaid access to undocumented immigrants — something that is already prohibited under previous laws — in that bill.

Jeffries, in his interview, accused Republicans of “lying” on that point “because they’re losing in the court of public opinion as it relates to what’s going on right now.”

He added that Democrats “are standing up for the health care of hardworking American taxpayers, of working-class Americans, of middle-class Americans and everyday Americans.”

Jeffries also said that “federal law clearly prohibits the expenditure of taxpayer dollars to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, period, full stop, and no Democrat on Capitol Hill is trying to change that law.”

Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year have been at the center of the debate over funding the government. Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.

“We have plenty of time to figure that out, because, again, it doesn’t expire until the end of the year,” the speaker told Welker.

Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the time to negotiate on the subsidies is now, before open enrollment for health care plans begins in early November.

The two leaders also spoke about the Trump administration’s plan to conduct mass layoffs of federal workers during the government shutdown. Multiple administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance last week, have blamed Democrats for fueling the layoffs.

“In a situation like this, where the Senate Democrats have decided to turn the keys to the kingdom over to the to the White House, they have to make tough decisions. Russ Vought runs the Office of Management and Budget,” Johnson said. “He has to now look at all of the federal government, recognizing that the funding streams have been turned off, and determine what are essential programs, policies and personnel. That’s that’s not a job that he relishes, but he’s being required to do it by Chuck Schumer.”

In a separate interview later Sunday on CNN, Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett confirmed that the administration still planned to fire some furloughed federal workers.

""If the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere, then there will be layoffs,"" Hassett said. ""I think that everybody's still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251002-mike-johnson-gk-f7cade.jpg",N,,2025-10-05 16:56:48.309982

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens , immigrants with legal status and children have been among detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves , the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building, according to bystander videos and NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation. The outlet reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.”

Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them, including parents and children, according to residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area.

Rodrick Johnson was among the U.S. citizens briefly detained and said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties. The 67-year-old was released hours later.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” he told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, has directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Four U.S. citizens were also briefly detained,

Brandon Lee, with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

“It is plain and clear that ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) are violent forces in our communities,” he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

On Saturday, immigration agents shot a woman they allege tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” They later said the woman was armed. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The 14th Amendment

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

Supreme Court rulings

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Lower court decisions

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" Chief Judge David Barron wrote. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

White House response

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.",https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2025/10/05/20251005p2g00m0in030000p/0c10.jpg?1,N,,2025-10-05 20:57:12.451297

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress.
Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week.
No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.
“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said.","Congress’s newest member, Adelita Grijalva, came to Washington DC this week, expecting to be officially sworn in by the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson.

Two days later, she returned to her southern Arizona district disappointed, if not a little confused. No swearing-in ceremony had been organized, meaning Grijalva, a Democrat who easily won a special election last month to replace her late father, Raúl M Grijalva, was not able to start her new job.

Trapped in the purgatorial status of representative-elect, she had to be escorted around the Capitol building by her soon-to-be-colleagues, like any other member of the public. Her name is on the door of her new office, but she does not have the keys.

“I want to get to work and I can’t,” Grijalva said.

She thinks she knows the reason why Johnson is in no rush to administer the oath: in addition to co-sponsoring bills on the environment, public education and other issues she campaigned on addressing, Grijalva plans to provide the final signature on a petition that would force a vote on legislation to release files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – which the speaker and Donald Trump oppose.

“I can’t think of any other reason. It’s not like my being sworn in changes the majority,” she said.

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress. Though Trump has decried it as a “Democrat hoax”, a small group of dissident Republicans have joined with all of the Democrats in the House of Representatives to pursue the legislative maneuver, known as a discharge petition. It just needs the signatures of 218 lawmakers to succeed, and has currently received 217 – Grijalva’s would be the last one.

The petition is a rare instance of defiance among congressional Republicans, who have given Trump much of what he wants ever since he returned to the White House. But even if it succeeds and the legislation passes the House, it is unlikely to go far. The Senate’s Republican leaders have shown little interest in the issue, and it is difficult to imagine Trump signing the bill.

Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week. Johnson last month called off planned work days to pressure Senate Democrats into voting for legislation the chamber has approved to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown.

However, the House did hold a three-and-a-half-minute procedural session on Tuesday – one Grijalva attended along with dozens of Democrats, in hopes of getting Johnson to swear her in. No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.

“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said. “And who is losing out are the constituents that need a Congress to work for them.”

A spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his comments signaling that Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, but that will not happen until funding is restored to the government.

“The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government,” Johnson said today, referring to the top Senate Democrat whom the Republicans blame for the funding lapse.

Grijalva along with her family had planned to be in Washington again by Tuesday of next week, in hopes the House would be back to work. On Friday afternoon, Johnson announced that it would take the whole week off.

“Now I have to change, blow up all of the travel plans that I made for everybody,” she said. “So, that’s frustrating.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945f4aefad55a59385ab8763cbadd1182cfcd379/222_0_6266_5013/master/6266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae1984b8d2ab36d709613ed54d9ec317",N,,2025-10-05 15:57:42.534036

Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations.
Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.","Kemi Badenoch, leader of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party, has unveiled an aggressive immigration reform plan aimed at detaining and deporting 150,000 illegal migrants annually, in what she described as the “toughest reforms Britain has ever seen” in border policy. The announcement was made in a video message posted on her X account on Sunday.

The plan, dubbed the Radical Borders Plan, envisages the establishment of a new Removals Force modelled after the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which would replace the current Home Office Immigration Enforcement unit. According to Badenoch, the Removals Force will have a mandate to remove all illegal entrants, foreign criminals, and undocumented migrants, while also monitoring illegal work. She stated, “My message is clear: if you’re here illegally, you will be detained and deported.”

Badenoch sharply criticised previous administrations, accusing both Conservative and Labour governments of failing to manage the migration crisis effectively. “Successive governments have failed on immigration. Labour promised to smash the gangs. Instead, in just a year, they delivered record small boat crossings, over 50,000 illegal arrivals, 32,000 people in asylum hotels, billions wasted. It’s pure weakness. Britain needs a serious, credible plan and the backbone to deliver it,” she said.

The proposed plan includes several controversial measures. Asylum claims from illegal entrants would be banned, the Human Rights Act repealed, and the United Kingdom withdrawn from the European Convention on Human Rights. Badenoch added that all new illegal arrivals would be deported within a week, with legal obstacles to mass removals removed and visa sanctions imposed on countries that refuse to repatriate their citizens. She also pledged to “shut down the asylum hotel racket,” which she said would save taxpayers billions and restore public confidence in the UK’s border controls.

The Removals Force, if approved, will operate with an annual budget of £1.6 billion, double that of the current Immigration Enforcement unit, funded by savings from the closure of asylum hotels and other measures within the asylum system. The force will have sweeping powers, including the use of facial recognition technology without prior warning, and will integrate closely with the police. Priority for removals will include new illegal entrants, foreign criminals, failed asylum seekers, visa over-stayers, and others identified as residing in the UK illegally.

In an interview on BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch faced criticism for her refusal to specify the destinations to which deported migrants would be sent. She responded, “I’m tired of all of these irrelevant questions about where they should go. They will go back to where they should be or another country, but they should not be here.” When pressed further, she added, “They will go back to where they came from.”

According to the Conservative Party document detailing the plan, the proposed measures are intended to increase removals from the current 34,000 per year to approximately 150,000, marking a five-fold increase in enforcement activity. The party argues that the reforms are necessary to address what it describes as uncontrolled migration and to strengthen public trust in the country’s border system.

Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations. Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.

Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.
In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation.
A spokesperson in MacKinnon's office declined to comment on whether the government would be open to significantly changing the bill or introducing a new bill.","Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says the federal Liberals must either heavily amend their border bill or introduce a new piece of proposed legislation if they want support to pass it into law.

""We've told Liberals that their current Bill C-2 will not pass unless they remove the violations of Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy,"" Poilievre said in an interview with CBC News.

""We don't think that law-abiding Canadians should lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals on borders and immigration.""

The Strong Borders Act, known as C-2, is a marquee piece of Liberal government legislation, introduced in the spring sitting in part as an effort to persuade the Trump administration that its concerns about border security — used to justify tariffs — were unwarranted.

Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon has said it's about ""ensuring law enforcement has the tools to keep our border secure,"" but civil rights groups and privacy experts criticized it, saying some provisions appear to go far beyond the stated aims of the legislation.

The 140-page proposed law includes sweeping powers for security and intelligence services, including expanding the ability to open and inspect mail and allowing officials to cancel or suspend immigration documents.

Bill C-2 also proposes giving police the ability to demand subscriber information from internet providers and other online companies — which could amount to law enforcement asking an internet company about a customer's online activity without a warrant.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has said such information provides ""a trove of background about our lives"" and questioned whether such a bill is compliant with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Conservatives had previously expressed concerns about ""snooping provisions"" in the bill, and on Friday, Poilievre confirmed his party will not support the existing bill and called on the Liberals to introduce a new piece of legislation.

""We've said to them that there's no way they're going to be able to pass their current bill, C-2, which attacks the freedoms and the privacy of Canadians,"" he said.

""They should reintroduce a new bill that focuses on law breakers, on restoring order at the border, on kicking out fraudulent refugees, while at the same time allowing people to send mail, use the internet or do legitimate lawful cash transactions.""

Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.

""Mail is the easiest thing to get a warrant for. If you suspect there's something suspicious in a parcel or envelope, you set it aside, you go to a judge and you get a warrant. The envelope or parcel is not going to grow legs and run away,"" he said.

In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation. The New Democrats, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party have expressed similar concerns about government overreach.

U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to not detain any child who came to the country alone and without permission in ICE adult detention facilities after they become an adult.

The Washington, D.C., judge found that such automatic detention violates a court order he issued in 2021 barring such practices.

ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond Saturday to emails seeking comment.

The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda — how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.

The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it.

“All of these are pieces of the same general policy to coerce immigrant youth into giving up their right to seek protection in the United States,” said Michelle Lapointe, a lawyer for the American Immigration Council, one of the groups that asked Contreras to intervene in a filing made just after midnight Saturday.

Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, under not ICE but the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Contreras’ 2021 order instructed federal officials to release minors who turn 18 from those shelters to “the least restrictive setting available.” He ruled that is what is required by federal law as long as the minor isn’t a danger to themselves or others and isn’t a flight risk. Minors are often released to the custody of a relative, or maybe into foster care.

But lawyers who represent unaccompanied minors said they began getting word in the last few days that ICE was telling shelters that children who were about to turn 18 — even those who had already-approved release plans — could no longer be released and would instead be taken to detention facilities, possibly as early as Saturday. One email from ICE asserted that the new adults could only be released by ICE under its case-by-case parole authority for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.” From March through September, ICE has paroled fewer than 500 people overall.

The plaintiffs argued that “release on parole is all but a dead letter” and that children aging out of shelters would experience lasting harm from “unnecessary and inappropriate adult detention” in jails that might be overcrowded or in remote locations. The plaintiffs said that was especially true because some of the clients they cited had been victims of trafficking or had been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents.

U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters since the Trump administration put them under closer scrutiny before releasing them to family in the United States to pursue their immigration cases.

The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d210b0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3078+0+148/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3f%2F9f%2Fce064532b019755ea8dfafcc7239%2F162bdd7bbd394aabac1a8f53ab8e12d3,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:51.453154

“The fact is, there are too many people in our country who should not be here,” Ms. Badenoch told the BBC, adding that “they don’t belong here, they are committing crimes, they are hurting people.”

Ms. Badenoch made her pledge on the opening day of an annual conference that is seen as critical for her leadership of the party, which has sunk in opinion polls since she took over last November. Even if she steadies her position, the next general election could be as far off as 2029, making Ms. Badenoch unlikely to reach Downing Street any time soon.

The announcement reflects a hardening stance on migration and other issues in Britain, where the political debate has been influenced both by Nigel Farage, the leader of a populist anti-immigration party, Reform U.K., and by the policies of President Trump.

House Republicans did not need Democrats to pass their short-term spending bill last month, which would fund the government mostly at current levels through 21 November.
Early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame Trump and Republicans than Democrats for the federal shutdown.
A Washington Post poll released on Thursday found that, by a 17-percentage-point margin, Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown.
Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants.","For months, as Donald Trump has used the levers of the US federal government to consolidate power, silence dissent and punish his political enemies, Democrats have been bombarded with a single demand: do something. Last week, they did.

In a rare display of unity, out-of-power Democrats embraced the risky politics of a government shutdown – their boldest effort yet to rein in a president whom many Americans and constitutional scholars now view as a threat to US democracy.

“It’s not a fight for fighting’s sake,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the outside groups closely coordinating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. “This is a battle about Donald Trump’s attacks on the constitution and him seizing the power over all spending from Congress – and whether Congress is going to let him get away with that.”

Washington is bracing for what could be an extended government shutdown, which officially began at 12.01am on Wednesday. Last week, Senate Democrats repeatedly blocked a Republican funding measure to reopen the government, as the parties traded blame and each side insisted they would not bend to the other’s demands.

Democrats are pressing for an array of healthcare-centered priorities, including the extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans set to expire at the end of the year. The White House and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have refused to include any healthcare concessions as part of a deal to reopen the government, though some GOP lawmakers are open to extending the ACA subsidies.

Democrats, with little leverage and deep skepticism that Republicans will honor any future deal, view the shutdown as their only option to force the issue.

But the Trump administration is working to make the closures as painful as possible for Democrats, who Republicans accuse of trying to “sabotage” the president’s agenda.

Trump has called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to dismantle federal programs and what he called “Democrat agencies”. In a sharp break from precedent, the Trump administration is readying plans to permanently layoffs of federal workers while it takes punitive action against Democratic-led states. Several government departments have posted partisan and potentially illegal messages saying their operations are curtailed due to “the Radical Left Democrat shutdown”. In the Senate, the majority leader John Thune has said he plans to hold more votes on a plan to reopen the government this week.

But Democrats say the stakes are too high – and the greater risk is capitulating to the president.

“Remember, right now, our healthcare system is broken. Right now, we’re the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,” the senator Bernie Sanders said in a video with progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explaining the Democrats’ opposition to the Republican funding bill. “And these guys want to make it even worse. We’re not going to let that happen.”

Progressive activists who have been sharply critical of the party’s congressional leaders, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, are now praising them for continuing to “hold the line on healthcare”.

“What our members see is Democrats willing to stand up and fight,” said Joel Payne, a spokesperson for MoveOn, which is part of a coalition of progressive groups flooding Democrats with calls to hold fast in shutdown negotiations.

Payne said healthcare was Democrats’ “north star” – the party’s strongest issue with voters and one that has helped propel them to victory in the past. If Democrats are successful, he added, the showdown over healthcare could serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other rights under attack by the administration.

House Republicans did not need Democrats to pass their short-term spending bill last month, which would fund the government mostly at current levels through 21 November. But in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, they need Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation.

So far, only three members of the Senate Democratic caucus have broken ranks: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King, an independent of Maine.

In the House, Maine congressman Jared Golden, was only House Democrat to back the Republican funding bill when it passed the House last month. In a statement last week, Golden said the shutdown was the “result of hardball politics” driven by the demands of “far-left groups” eager to show their opposition to Trump.

Early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame Trump and Republicans than Democrats for the federal shutdown. A Washington Post poll released on Thursday found that, by a 17-percentage-point margin, Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown. Independents overwhelmingly sided with Democrats, the survey found.

Yet there were signs public opinion could shift as more Americans face the ripple effects of government-wide closures. In several polls, a significant share of voters said they held both parties equally responsible or were unsure of whom to blame.

The call for Democrats to take a harder line against Trump has been building for months. Across the country, progressive activists, disaffected Republicans and voters outraged by the administration’s actions have packed town halls, marched in protests and launched campaigns of their own – sending a clear message to Democrats: step up, or step aside.

“Everybody wants a fighter,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the centrist thinktank Third Way that is often at odds with the party’s left flank.

Erickson said the focus on healthcare – an issue that unifies the party’s diverse coalition and falls squarely in the “Venn diagram of things voters care about” – was both good politics and good policy.

“The ACA subsidies are a real ask,” she said. “If Democrats got that, it would be a way to declare victory in this moment.”

Democrats feel confident going to battle over healthcare. A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll showed that 78% of Americans support extending the credits, which disproportionately benefit Republican-held congressional districts.

Without action, insurance premiums for millions of Americans could double next year, according to an analysis by KFF. Democrats have also sought to reverse Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s marquee tax-and-immigration package, which the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects will leave 10 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade.

Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants. The White House has taunted Democrats with a deepfake video of Schumer and Jeffries, wearing a sombrero and fake mustache that has been widely denounced as racist. Vance laughed off the criticism, calling the video “funny”.

Democrats like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, fired back with memes and taunts of their own. In one tweet, Newsom’s press team posted an AI generated image of Trump in a towering wig and an 18th-century gown: TRUMP “MARIE ANTOINETTE” SAYS, “NO HEALTH CARE FOR YOU PEASANTS, BUT A BALLROOM FOR THE QUEEN!”

Democrats are betting that the shutdown strategy can help shift momentum heading into next year’s midterm elections. By wielding their most powerful legislative tool, party leaders aim to rebuild trust with their disillusioned base – a group whose frustration has dragged Democratic approval ratings to decade lows and hurt fundraising.

Many Democrats argue that their best hope of restraining Trump is to regain the House in 2026, and that the most straightforward path to doing so is to focus on kitchen-table issues like healthcare.

Some Democratic strategists warn that by focusing primarily on healthcare, the party risks downplaying what many view as Trump’s authoritarian lurch – reducing it to just another policy showdown in Washington’s partisan budget battles.

Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic strategist and communications researcher, believes a sharper message – such as “we will not fund fascism” or “no dollars for dictatorship” – would help cut through the noise and clarify the stakes.

“In order for people to fight this regime, they have to understand it as a regime hellbent on taking our freedoms,” she said.

As part of their demands, Democrats are also pushing for ways to curtail Trump’s ability to rescind funding already approved by Congress, as he has done with foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. An alternative short-term funding bill offered by Democrats included provisions that would make it harder for the president to undermine Congress’s funding power.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible and a leading voice on the left pushing Democrats to fight harder against what he calls the Trump “regime”, said he was encouraged to see the party’s leadership sharpen its tactics. Though Levin shares the view that the stakes are far bigger than a healthcare policy dispute, he believes Democrats’ demands, if met, could “constrain the regime in some meaningful ways”.

Indivisible is helping to coordinate a second wave of No Kings rallies across the country to protest what organizers described as Trump’s “authoritarian power grab”. The day of action, planned for 18 October, will be another opportunity to mobilize Americans and, Levin hopes, to celebrate Democrats for their resolve.

“I hope what we will not be doing is criticizing them for having surrendered again,” he said. “So the play is to win.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a0a19273693e8b73b5c00423004d7f34a026dd/81_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96af3544967124b8c341f2dffa705562",N,,2025-10-05 13:57:01.925731

This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”","(NewsNation) — A Chicago alderperson who was handcuffed by federal immigration authorities while inquiring about a man who was injured during a foot chase with agents says the experience demonstrates how the Trump administration is sowing fear and chaos across the city.

Ald. Jessie Fuentes said she was asking feds at the hospital Friday if they had a signed warrant for the undocumented individual they were after. Agents spun her around and handcuffed her, according to video posted to the Citizen App. She was quickly released, Fuentes said, but was warned not to try to re-enter the hospital.

“In the hospital, there are patients, there are staff that did not feel safe, and they called me to find out why ICE was in the hospital,” said Fuentes, referring to officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Now, as the alderperson of the 26th Ward, I have a moral obligation to protect the residents that live in my ward.”

Fuentes said her brush with ICE is just one example of how the feds under the Trump administration are riding roughshod over people since the Department of Homeland Security sent a surge of resources to Chicago to enforce immigration laws. She argues relatively few migrants caught up in the dragnet have criminal records, and even U.S. citizens are being swept up because of their appearance.

“There are U.S. citizens who are contractors, laborers, in the city of Chicago that are being detained because they’re Brown and they speak Spanish,” Fuentes told “NewsNation Prime” on Saturday. “This is not about making our community safe. This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/citizen.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:56.898648

Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White.

After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.
I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""","It's 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in the heart of Hollywood, and the service at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is just getting underway. It was worship via the web. The church itself was empty, just like during the pandemic, when parishioners feared catching COVID. Today it was empty because they fear being caught themselves.

On June 6, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement descended on Ambiance Apparel, a clothing wholesaler in L.A.'s Fashion District. The pastor of St. Stephen's, Father Jaime Edwards Acton, whose congregation is about 80% Hispanic, got a frantic call: ""She said, 'They got 'em.' At first, I had no idea what she was talking about because I was not thinking about it,"" Acton said. ""Even with all the threats and the bravado and stuff, I was not thinking that it would happen directly to us.""

Thirteen members of his congregation were arrested that day. The Trump Administration no longer considers schools, hospitals and churches to be ""protected sensitive locations"" anymore. So, the following Sunday, Acton told his faithful to stay away.

He says the decision to close the church was not made lightly: ""No, not at all, but I was trying to balance, could we do church in person knowing that a good portion of our community was too afraid to leave their homes? It wasn't even people that were undocumented. I have longtime parishioners that I know for sure are citizens and have been for a while that were afraid to leave. They were afraid to leave their homes.""

In Los Angeles, that fear turned to anger, and anger into violence. The raids were challenged in court for being indiscriminate and based on skin color, but ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the raids could continue.

Since then, in city after city, the administration has been testing the court's limits, especially in Chicago. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States. Now ICE is making it commonplace.""

Pritzker said Saturday the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. Pritzker said Mr. Trump gave him an ultimatum: ""Call up your troops, or we will.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has long defended the ICE raids as only going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""Nobody is getting swept up,"" Noem said on August 8. ""We're running targeted enforcement operations across the country.""

But as those operations increased, so have assaults on federal agents: a sniper attack on an ICE facility in Dallas; an ambush in Alvarado, Texas; a violent scuffle in San Francisco.

And then there is Portland. Protests around the ICE headquarters there have sparked particular ire from President Donald Trump, who directed federal troops to be sent to what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called a ""war-ravaged city."" [On Saturday a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland.]

In fact, this past week, while addressing top military brass, the president suggested American cities could serve as ""training grounds"" for U.S. combat troops. ""It seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And we're gonna straighten 'em out one by one. And this is gonna be a major part for some of the people in this room.""

""This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore""

That idea has some military commanders uneasy, and even civilians within ICE itself are finding themselves conflicted.

As part of ICE's legal department, attorney Adam Boyd provided guidance related to how ICE officers performed their enforcement duties. ""I saw this push to find how can we accomplish the goal with anything that seems legal enough,"" he said. ""We're lumping people with no criminal history who have been here for a very long time with the 'worst of the worst.'

""There's no question we have threats in our country,"" Boyd said. ""That's why the State Department and Homeland Security and the FBI and all these agencies work together to keep people safe. This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore. It feels like we're just hitting numbers and goals.""

Take the case of 20-year-old Dylan Contreras, who came into the U.S. from Venezuela under a Biden-era mobile app. Back in April, though, DHS began revoking the legal status of many of those who used that app to apply for asylum.

While his case was pending, Contreras had been attending high school in the Bronx learning English, and working as a delivery driver, in order to get his mom, Raiza, and his two younger siblings – Helen, 10 and Caleb, 7 – out of a shelter.

Last May, Contreras did what he was required to: he showed up for his court hearing in New York. His mother said they assumed it was just another routine hearing in the process. ""Yes, I didn't think anything bad would happen,"" she said through an interpreter. ""He wanted to enter legally; he didn't want to get into trouble. He did it the right way.""

As they left the courtroom, however, his mother says federal agents followed them into the elevator. ""Like, five people or something came at me and grabbed me, pushed me to the floor,"" she said. ""My son screamed, and they grabbed him, too, and put handcuffs on him.""

Contreras did not have a criminal record. ""Not at all, not at all,"" his mother said. ""Those who know him, know.""

His case for asylum was denied last month. Pending an appeal, Contreras will be deported, leaving his mother and his two young siblings behind. Raiza said she was ""Devastated, devastated, because I've always been with my children, and he's been my partner. He's always been more than a son, a friend, everything.""

The most recent ICE data shows those with no criminal record, like Contreras, now make up the bulk of those being arrested and detained.

The Department of Homeland Security, however, is quick to list the violent offenders who have been captured, and there are many.

As for Adam Boyd? Back in May he resigned his position at ICE citing ""unforeseen circumstances.""

""It was a difficult decision,"" he said. ""If you think something is wrong, then you have to recognize that.""

He's now working for a firm in Philadelphia defending those arrested by ICE, which is no small task. After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Fr. Jaimie Edwards Acton says the expansion of ICE should be seen as a warning: ""I would tell everybody who thinks that this would never happen to them, that it could happen to them,"" he said. ""And people need to be ready for it, and to think through the possible, you know, kind of responses to it.""

For Acton, that response is no more hiding. For any immigrant, legal or otherwise, this is the new reality.

So, for those willing to come back, the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is open again, with eyes out for ICE, while they pray for peace and understanding.

I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""

""Yeah,"" said Acton, ""but, you know, David won that one!""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/04/e7da5ee7-85c8-4302-a1b2-728f70d17f14/thumbnail/1200x630/895dbf664fec70ae6389f37be0e51593/ice-agents-1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:17.883086

Under the Interior Department contingency plan, guided tours of other cave systems, including those in Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, likely will be limited or suspended.

White Sands National Park Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.
Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.","Mr. Pritzker singled out a late-night Border Patrol raid last week at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side, when video taken by bystanders showed residents of the building restrained with zip ties.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker said. He added: “They are the ones that are making it a war zone. They need to get out of Chicago if they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do.”

Mr. Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration, which planned to send 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, is intentionally heightening tensions. The administration wants to “create the war zone so they can send in even more troops,” he said.

Mr. Pritzker said he had directed state agencies to investigate what happened at the apartment building, citing reports of “children who were zip tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” Mr. Pritzker added he believed that some of the people were U.S. citizens.

“What kind of a country are we living in?” he said.

The governor also said he wanted to know more about an episode in Chicago on Saturday when a federal agent shot and wounded a motorist who, according to federal officials, had rammed and boxed-in a law enforcement vehicle.

“It’s really hard to know exactly what the facts are, and they won’t let us access the facts,” he said. “They are just putting out their propaganda. And then we’ve got to later determine what actually happened.”

Asked whether the two-year-old war was over, Mr. Rubio responded: “Well not yet. There’s some work remains to be done.” He went on to say that Hamas had “agreed to the president’s hostage release framework.”

Mr. Rubio spoke a day before a new round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, conducted through mediators, was expected to begin in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Ron Dermer, a close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, will lead Israel’s delegation. Hamas officials did not respond to requests for comment on who would attend from their side.

The Cairo talks are expected to focus on swapping the remaining hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners — one component in the sweeping proposal released by Mr. Trump last week. Mr. Rubio suggested that this focus would leave negotiations on other formidable obstacles to ending the war until a later stage.

Israel believes that about 20 living hostages still remain in Gaza, as well as the bodies of at least 25 others. It is unclear whether Hamas would free the hostages before concluding the rest of an agreement to end the war as it views the captives as the most significant leverage it has with Israel.

Mr. Trump’s proposal demands that Hamas return all of the surviving captives and the bodies in its possession within 72 hours of Israel agreeing to the cease-fire.

“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST,” Mr. Trump said in a post on social media on Saturday.

The president’s plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian government supervised by an international “Board of Peace” led by Mr. Trump as chairman and a postwar security force drawn from foreign countries, as well as the disarming of Hamas.

Under the plan, the hostages will be swapped for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in prison and 1,700 Gazans jailed by Israel during the war. Israel will also hand over the bodies of 15 Gazans for each dead Israeli.

Mr. Netanyahu has said he supports the proposal. Hamas officials have expressed significant reservations about some of the terms, in particular about surrendering their weapons. But even the first step of exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli pullback within Gaza will likely present difficulties, analysts say.

Both Israeli and Hamas officials say that the Palestinian group might need more time. Some living captives are believed to be held deep underground, while the bodies of others will need to be located and dug up.

Another potential sticking point to a deal will be how far Israeli forces commit to withdrawing from their current positions within Gaza.

In previous talks, Hamas had agreed for Israeli troops to withdraw to a buffer zone close to the enclave’s borders. But the lines proposed by Mr. Trump would leave Israeli forces deployed far deeper in Gaza, which Hamas could object to.

Israel and Hamas will likely disagree over the list of names of Palestinian prisoners to be released, who include many jailed for attacks on Israeli civilians. In the past, Hamas officials have indicated they would demand the release of senior Palestinian leaders jailed by Israel such as Marwan Barghouti — which Israel would likely oppose.

Israel and Hamas have now fought for two years since Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war and killed about 1,200 people. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza — including thousands of children — according to local health officials.

The war has devastated the Gaza Strip, whose two million Palestinian residents have lived through constant fear, widespread hunger and bombardment. Human rights groups and a U.N. commission have accused Israel of genocide; the Israeli government says it is fighting Hamas, not Palestinian civilians.

The warring sides agreed to two short-lived cease-fires that saw more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages freed in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners. Israel ended the last truce in mid-March, citing a deadlock in talks on a comprehensive cease-fire.

Israel and Hamas do not speak directly, instead relying on Qatari and Egyptian mediators to act as go-betweens, ferrying messages back and forth.

“As a general rule, if a facility or area is locked or secured during nonbusiness hours (buildings, gated parking lots, etc.) it should be locked or secured for the duration of the shutdown,” a contingency plan posted online by the Interior Department states.

Roughly two-thirds of the employees at the National Park Service, which is already facing a steep staffing shortage, have been furloughed during the shutdown, according to the plan. How much the remaining crew members will be able to do involving essential functions like law enforcement, emergency services and wildfire monitoring is unclear.

While not a comprehensive list, here is a rundown among prominent destinations of what is open, what is not and what is limited while the shutdown persists.

California National Parks

California’s nine national parks, the most of any state in the country, broadly remain open to visitors, according to the parks’ websites. But services will be limited, and some facilities, including Black Rock Nature Center in Joshua Tree National Park, will be closed.

Elsewhere in the state, local media reported that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, home to the infamous former federal prison of the same name, reopened last week after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown. And Muir Woods, a national monument near San Francisco famed for its redwood trees, will be closed, according to its website.

Utah National Parks

According to the Utah Office of Tourism website, the state’s five national parks — Zion, Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon — will remain open during the shutdown, with visitor centers at each park either open now or slated to open this weekend.

Colorado National Parks

The eight National Park Service sites in Colorado that collect fees — including Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Parks — will continue to operate using fee revenues until that funding runs out, the state’s governor, Jared Polis, said in a statement. State agencies are working with National Park Service leaders to keep those parks open, and county sheriffs in the state have also offered to support law enforcement at national park sites during the shutdown, Mr. Polis’s office said.

Underground attractions

The caves in Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico will be closed for the duration of the shutdown, as will all roads into the park, according to a post on the park’s Facebook page. Under the Interior Department contingency plan, guided tours of other cave systems, including those in Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, likely will be limited or suspended.

Grand Canyon National Park

Arizona’s most famous National Park will remain open to the public during the shutdown, but it will not collect entrance fees, according to the Grand Canyon Conservancy. Buildings on the site that are operated by the National Park Service, such as visitor centers, will be closed, the group said.

Elsewhere in the state, Petrified Forest National Park, which typically closes overnight, will likely be inaccessible for the duration of the shutdown under the Interior Department’s contingency plan.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park

The country’s most visited National Park will remain open, according to a news release from Sevier County, Tenn., which encompasses a section of the park. Under a joint plan formed by several state and local agencies and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, areas that closed at the start of the shutdown will reopen. Staff members will be on duty to clean restrooms, as well as protect visitors and wildlife, according to the statement.

Acadia National Park

In a news release on Wednesday, Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that Acadia National Park would remain “mostly open” during the shutdown, with essential visitor services intact. Local media reported on Thursday that the road to Cadillac Mountain, the park’s highest peak, which offers sweeping views of the Maine coastline, had reopened after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown.

White Sands National Park

Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.

Washington, D.C., Museums and Attractions

Most museums and monuments in D.C. remain open, but more could begin to close if the shutdown continues, according to Destination DC, a nonprofit that promotes tourism in the nation’s capital. Sites that have already closed include the Library of Congress, the National Archives Museum, the Washington Monument and the National Arboretum, according to the site. Tours of the Capitol Building and the Pentagon are also suspended.

Sites run by the Smithsonian Institution — including galleries and museums across D.C. and the National Zoo — will remain open through Oct. 11, the institution said in a statement. Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.

Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia

Several landmarks in Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park — including the Liberty Bell Center, Independence Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Museum — are closed, according to Visit Philadelphia.

Gateway Arch in St. Louis

The tram to reach the observation deck of the Arch will be suspended during the shutdown, and all ticketed events at the site have been canceled until further notice, according to the park’s website.

In her ruling, Judge Immergut wrote that she expected a trial court to agree with the state’s contention that the president exceeded his constitutional authority in mobilizing federal troops for local work and likely violated the 10th Amendment.

The soldiers have been training on the Oregon coast and were expected to be in place by the weekend, though federal officials have not said what duties they would perform beyond assisting ICE.

The restraining order expires in two weeks. During that time, the judge is expected to rule on a request for a longer injunction against the deployment. Federal lawyers have appealed the restraining order, which is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Oregon and Portland that accuses the president of violating his constitutional authority.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman said. “We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

The decision comes as the president pushes to deploy the National Guard in several major U.S. cities to combat crime and support immigration enforcement. On Saturday, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that Mr. Trump planned to send 300 Guard troops to Chicago soon.

Before the judge’s ruling, Oregon National Guard troops were not the only Guard troops who were on the cusp of deploying in the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was told by the federal government that, against his wishes, California National Guard troops who had been deployed in Los Angeles under federal orders were going to be sent to Oregon to help train troops there, according to a state official close to the governor who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation.

During almost two hours of arguments Friday, lawyers for Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, contended that the president did not have the authority to use the National Guard at the ICE facility and warned that the arrival of federal forces would lead to greater violence.

State and city attorneys described Mr. Trump’s selection of Portland for deployment as “at best, arbitrary, and at worst, a politically motivated retaliation for the adoption of policies” that the president viewed as too liberal.

The president’s actions “represent one of the most dramatic infringements on state sovereignty in Oregon’s history,” Scott Kennedy, an attorney for Oregon said in court. “They radically reshape the balance of federal-state power,”

State lawyers also questioned the timing of Mr. Trump’s decision, noting records from the Portland Police Bureau that showed the size of the nightly demonstrations had dwindled before the president posted on his social media website last Saturday that he planned to ask the Department of Defense to use federal troops to “protect” Portland.

Portland Police commanders checked in with ICE officials every evening, according to records they filed in support of the temporary restraining order, and for several weeks prior to the president’s declaration, ICE employees reported that things were relatively quiet and that they did not need help.

Judge Immergut, who was appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term, agreed that the timing of the president’s order did not meet the legal standard for calling in the National Guard, saying the state provided “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the President’s directive.”

Mr. Kennedy also said the situation in Portland did not meet the standard required for mobilization of federal soldiers for domestic work; the law allows federal troops to be used domestically in times of foreign invasion, rebellion or when normal law enforcement efforts are not capable of maintaining order.

Federal lawyers contended that the protests in Portland constituted both a potential rebellion and a law enforcement challenge beyond what federal officers on the ground could handle. But Mr. Kennedy said the federal government was defining “rebellion” so broadly it could include any political demonstrations or “opposition to its authority.”

Judge Immergut agreed, writing that the federal government had shown evidence of “sporadic violence” but not “any evidence demonstrating that those episodes of violence were part of an organized attempt to overthrow the government as a whole.”

Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department lawyer, told the judge the decision to use National Guard soldiers was prompted by the Sept. 24 shooting that killed two detainees at a Dallas ICE facility and months of demonstrations in Portland that have left federal employees frightened and exhausted.

“Violent and cruel radicals have laid siege,” he said. “The evidence we have submitted at least reflects a danger of a rebellion, monthslong targeting of the Portland ICE building with violence, intimidation and threats.”

In the order released Saturday evening, Judge Immergut wrote that the president’s argument about the need for mobilization was contradicted by evidence that recent protests had been comparatively quiet and nonviolent, supporting the state’s case that the decision to use troops “was not ‘conceived in good faith.’”

The nightly demonstrations at Portland’s ICE building began in early summer and have included occasional skirmishes between protesters and federal agents as demonstrators tried to block vehicles from entering and exiting a parking garage. Multiple times a day, ICE agents in riot gear march out of the building to clear the driveway. During daylight hours, the crowd disperses quickly. At times federal officers have used pepper balls, tear gas and other crowd dispersal weapons to move people back.The Portland Police Bureau reported 27 arrests since early June outside the building, and court records show at least two dozen arrests by federal officers.

The protests have turned rougher since the president’s announcement last weekend with the arrival of right wing counterprotesters, some of whom have been spotted observing the crowd from the ICE building roof. A march to protest the potential deployment Saturday afternoon ended with federal officers using tear gas and pepper balls against a crowd that had gathered in the road in front of the building.

Judge Immergut, a former U.S. attorney in Oregon, is the second federal judge assigned to Oregon’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump. The first recused after a request from the federal lawyers because his wife, Representative Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, had spoken out against the National Guard deployment.

On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.
“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.
The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard.
Jessie Fuentes also alleges she was handcuffed by immigration agents while questioning them at a Humboldt Park medical center.","After weeks of threatening to do so, President Donald Trump is taking command of 300 Illinois National Guard troops and sending them to Chicago over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections, the governor announced Saturday.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

The promised deployment comes as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, activity has ramped up in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings, including one Saturday on the city’s Southwest Side.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The wave of raids and arrests has spurred large protests in recent weeks, especially outside of an ICE processing center in Broadview, a suburb eight miles west of Chicago. The demonstrations have spurred clashes between immigration agents and activists, leading to the arrests of several protestors last weekend on charges of resisting and assaulting officers. Agents have sprayed chemical agents and fired nonlethal rounds into the crowds outside the facility.

On Monday, Pritzker announced DHS was seeking 100 Illinois National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities and immigration agents in Illinois, warning the Trump administration would use any confrontation resulting from its Chicago-area immigration crackdown as a “pretext” for a military deployment.

On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,“ Pritzker said, pointing to the Illinois State Police’s announcement this week that it had joined forces with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to form a “Unified Command” to coordinate law enforcement activity outside the ICE facility.

One of ISP’s first acts in Broadview was designating demonstration areas, also known as “free speech zones.” Pritzker on Saturday said the combined efforts of state and local law enforcement protected “people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.”

The Unified Command reported the arrests of at least five protesters on Friday, but none on Saturday. The area was quiet Saturday afternoon with only about a dozen protesters gathered, at times outnumbered by members of the media.

“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.

But shortly before Pritzker’s announcement about the National Guard deployment Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman in an altercation between immigration agents and protesters on Chicago’s Southwest Side.

According to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times, the woman was alleged to have been driving one of 10 cars that “rammed” and “boxed in” nearly three dozen immigration agents in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. Agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” according to the paper. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Trump and Pritzker have spent weeks trading barbs over the president’s threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, with the governor alleging Trump’s apparent backing off from the idea last month was a sign of dementia.

The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard. After the president sent 1,400 National Guard troops to Los Angeles this summer — the first time since the 1960s that the feds deployed the National Guard without a governor’s consent — a federal judge last month ruled the move violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters. But the ruling only applies to California.

The National Guard’s presence in Los Angeles has dwindled to roughly 250, but there are still a couple thousand troops on assignment in Washington, D.C., where the federal government has more power over law enforcement. Since their August deployment to the nation’s capital, guardsmen have been reportedly picking up garbage, as they are only authorized to assist with arrests if asked by local law enforcement.

Trump has also threatened to federalize the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, though troops have not yet been sent. Tennessee’s Republican governor has welcomed the president’s recent suggestion that he’d deploy guardsmen to Memphis, but that has also yet to happen.

Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C. and Shelby County, Tennessee, where Memphis is situated, have all adopted so-called “sanctuary city” policies wherein local law enforcement are barred from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has targeted cities and states that have adopted such laws, and last week a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled the administration cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

But this week, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he learned of another attempt by the White House to divert disaster relief funding from Illinois with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.”

Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois again on Friday. Noem has traveled to the Chicago area and Springfield several times this year, including last month when she oversaw an early morning raid in Elgin, where at least one U.S. citizen was arrested.

“Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability,” Pritzker said in a statement.

On Friday, Noem appeared with Gregory Bovino, commander-at-large of the U.S. Border Patrol, at the Broadview ICE facility with a camera crew, according to Chicago’s ABC 7.

Late Friday, Pritzker also said he’s making state resources available to people affected by a Sept. 30 raid on a South Shore apartment building.

In Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, masked federal agents deployed a chemical irritant outside of a grocery store as people and cars lined up to block their advancement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

State Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, condemned the action, which happened around the corner from an elementary school in her district. Chicago Ald. Jessie Fuentes also alleges she was handcuffed by immigration agents while questioning them at a Humboldt Park medical center.",https://www.bnd.com/public/latest-news/9vwr92/picture312389933/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/251004%20BROADVIEW%20AA.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 10:56:23.130936

Families have gone from prison to prison, police station to police station, seeking their loved ones, without success, human rights groups say.
Of those 33 missing prisoners, least a dozen are over 60, and several, like Mr. Hurtado, have diabetes and high blood pressure.
The police officers who showed up without warrants to arrest Mr. Hurtado and search his home in Managua suggested five police stations where the family might later find him, said Mr. Hurtado’s brother Adolfo.
Angelica Chavarríahas was last seen in May 2024, the same day her partner, Daniel Ortega’s brother Humberto, was placed under house arrest, according to human rights organizations.","The police arrived at José Alejandro Hurtado’s house in Nicaragua’s capital one night in January, telling him he had to come to their station house because someone had rented a car using his ID, and the vehicle had been stolen.

That’s the last anyone saw of him.

Mr. Hurtado, 57, a computer systems engineer and a longtime political activist, is one of nearly three dozen people who human rights groups say have been disappeared by Nicaraguan authorities — taken away with officials refusing to acknowledge their detention or disclose their whereabouts.

Such disappearances are a violation of international law and are especially resonant in Latin America, where the practice has been a hallmark of brutal dictatorships. In Nicaragua, they have been happening within the past two years, the majority of them more recently.

Nearly half of the 73 political prisoners that human rights groups have officially documented in Nicaragua appear in no public court database. They have had no contact with their families, and the crimes they were charged with are unknown. Families have gone from prison to prison, police station to police station, seeking their loved ones, without success, human rights groups say.

The authorities summoned relatives to a coroner’s office and escorted them to a cemetery to bury Mr. Petri without the opportunity for an autopsy, human rights groups said.

Four days later, the body of Carlos Cárdenas Cepeda, a lawyer for the Catholic church, which has also been targeted by the government, was given back to his family. He had been detained for 15 days. No cause of death was given in either case, and the government has made no public pronouncements about them.

These deaths have alarmed the families of the others detained about whom the authorities have revealed nothing. Of those 33 missing prisoners, least a dozen are over 60, and several, like Mr. Hurtado, have diabetes and high blood pressure. One of the missing detainees is 81.

The police officers who showed up without warrants to arrest Mr. Hurtado and search his home in Managua suggested five police stations where the family might later find him, said Mr. Hurtado’s brother Adolfo.

Mr. Hurtado’s wife and his two brothers spent weeks visiting police stations and prisons, where they said they faced bureaucratic runarounds and hourslong waits.

“At first, two brothers and she went once a week, so three times a week, for more or less a month and a half,” Adolfo Hurtado said, referring to José Alejandro Hurtado’s wife. “That rhythm was unsustainable for the family.”

Adolfo Hurtado said he believes his brother was targeted because he had publicly released a proposal for national dialogue and elections to address the country’s political crisis.

Nicaragua’s co-presidents, but particularly Ms. Murillo, seem fixated on clearing the political landscape of any independent voices who could threaten her ability to govern if Mr. Ortega, who will turn 80 next month, dies.

Ms. Murillo, 74, who also acts as a government spokeswoman, did not respond to requests for comment.

Forced disappearances have a long and painful history in Latin America. The term “desaparecido” became synonymous with political repression between 1976 and 1983 in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 accused dissidents, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.

And throughout Latin America hundreds of thousands of people who have disappeared since the 1970s were taken to secret detention centers, tortured and executed. Many of their bodies were never found.

While hundreds of people eventually faced trial in Argentina, many cases of the disappeared went unpunished, said María Adela Antokoletz, who heads the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.

“We realize that the abhorrent practice of enforced disappearance continues as a means to silence complaints,” she said.

Mexico, El Salvador and Colombia are three countries in the region where the practice still occurs, though more often perpetrated by gangs or cartels with the acquiescence of local police or mayors, Ms. Antokoletz said.

Authorities are obligated under international law to inform family members if they are holding someone, said Barbara Frey, a retired University of Minnesota professor who coedited a book about disappearances in contemporary Latin America.

“If the state has taken them and won’t tell the families where they are, that’s a disappearance,” Ms. Frey said. “That’s exactly what the definition says.”

The term historically applied to people missing for prolonged stretches of time, said Reed Brody, a member of the United Nations Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua. But international authorities have increasingly recognized that it also applies even to short-term secret detentions, like those in Nicaragua, he said.

Mr. Brody said the 33 documented cases in Nicaragua were believed to be an undercount because many families are too afraid to file a complaint with human rights organizations. The families have reported being harassed and threatened with arrest or having their property confiscated if they persist in trying to track down their loved ones, human rights experts said.

The missing include community leaders, teachers, Indigenous leaders, journalists and pastors. In at least five cases, multiple people in the same family were arrested. Many were detained over the summer, when more than 50 people were arrested in simultaneous roundups.

“It’s hard to know why some people are arrested and some people are disappeared,” Mr. Brody said.

Angelica Chavarríahas was last seen in May 2024, the same day her partner, Daniel Ortega’s brother Humberto, was placed under house arrest, according to human rights organizations.

He died last year.

Thelma Brenes says she has a theory behind the disappearances. Her father, Carlos Brenes Sánchez, 70, and his partner, Salvadora Martínez, 67, Ms. Brenes said, were taken on Aug. 14 from their home in Jinotepe, about 90 miles north of Managua, Ms. Brenes said.

“If they are disappearing people who they are not registering in jail, how can you prove that there are political prisoners in Nicaragua?” she said. “There are no pictures. He’s not in the system. Can we prove it?”

Mr. Brenes is a retired military colonel and a longtime opponent of Mr. Ortega. He was arrested in 2018 when he spoke out against government abuses after mass street protests but was released a year later under an amnesty law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/23/multimedia/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:13.136435

The White House later confirmed that President Donald Trump has ""authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets"" amid ongoing ICE raids in the Chicago area.

Pritzker said the Department of War gave him an ultimatum, telling him to call up the troops himself.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said, in part. He said the administration intends to federalize hundreds of National Guard troops ""in the coming hours.""

A White House spokesperson shared a statement with ABC7 Chicago Saturday night, saying, ""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has authorized 300 national guardsmen to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

The announcement came after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Portland for at least 14 days. Oregon's governor, said in a statement, ""justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed.""

The concern over a deployment of Illinois National Guard members prompted an emergency motion filed by Broadview leaders Saturday. The village is seeking the removal of the fence erected by federal authorities around the ICE facility amid ongoing demonstrations.

The village has called the fence illegal and a safety hazard, asking for a judge to grant the motion pending a Tuesday hearing on the village's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS responded to that motion in its own court filing, saying there's no need for a hearing before Tuesday, bringing up the possibility of a settlement on Monday.

Amid the announcement of the federalization of the National Guard in Illinois, confrontations seemed to arise again Saturday in Broadview between demonstrators and Illinois State Police throughout the day.

""It's a continuing overreach by the president because the governor is responsible for calling up the troops when they think it's necessary,"" demonstrator Tony DiBenedetto said.

A crowd of anti-ICE demonstrators cheered on at least four people ABC7 saw detained by Illinois State Police as they were walked into a Cook County Sheriff's Office van in handcuffs. They were taken down as troopers were clearing the street outside the ICE detention center in Broadview, backing protesters into designated zones, feet from the immigration building and surrounded by concrete barriers. Federal agents were on the other side of the fence with their flying drone above it all.

""I'm not here to deal with the State Police. I'm here to deal with the kidnapping that ICE is doing, and it's immensely disappointing that State Police are putting themselves between us and ICE,"" demonstrator Will Creutz said.

Tensions continued throughout the night Saturday between Illinois State Police and demonstrators.

Federal agents and protesters also clashed at the west suburban Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday morning.

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said at least five people were arrested during those clashes. They are facing charges such as resisting, obstruction and aggravated battery to a police officer.

That clash came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino were seen on the ICE facility's roof just before 8 a.m. They were accompanied by several armed agents, cameras and a production crew.

President Donald Trump has previously threatened to send the National Guard to Chicago to combat crime, and even said earlier this week that the city could become a training ground for the military.

On Monday, Pritzker said he learned that DHS is requesting that 100 military personnel be sent to Illinois to protect ICE agents.

Full Saturday statement from Pritzker:

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.

In the coming hours, the Trump Administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. They will pull hardworking Americans out of their regular jobs and away from their families all to participate in a manufactured performance -- not a serious effort the protect public safety. For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control.

This demand follows unprecedented escalations of aggression against Illinois citizens and residents. Yesterday, Kristi Noem's and Greg Bovino's masked agents threw chemical agents near an elementary school, arrested elected officials exercising their First Amendment rights, and raided a Wal-Mart. None of it was in pursuit of justice, but all of it was in pursuit of social media videos.

I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois. State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people's ability to peacefully exercise their connotational rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump's acts of aggression against our people.

In Illinois, we will do everything within our power to look out for our neighbors, uphold the Constitution, and defend the rule of law.""

Statement from Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton:

""Donald Trump intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and deploy them to Chicago without the consent of Governor Pritzker or our administration. These are Illinoisans who will be ripped away from their families to serve in Trump's political stunt. We have warned that this has been their plan all along, and now it's here.

Our city is not a sandbox for Donald Trump to play dictator. It's intentional cruelty that will devastate families and scar our communities.

Let me be clear: the only emergency in Chicago is the chaos that Donald Trump and his administration are deliberately fueling in our streets. Journalists targeted and shot at, peaceful residents dragged from their homes, women and children zip-tied in the streets, families torn apart and stuffed into U-Hauls. This is unacceptable, reprehensible, and not what we stand for in Illinois.

""I have spent my career working to make communities safer and lead on public safety for our administration. Not a single violence-prevention expert I have worked with has ever said the answer is to flood our neighborhoods with federal troops. This move will only serve to spread fear, escalate conflict, and undermine the trust that keeps communities safe.

From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities.
Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.
“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said.
“State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.","Dozens of state and local police officers aided federal officers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a protest near the agency’s Broadview holding facility Friday by helping escort federal vehicles and maintaining a large perimeter line, which at times included officers from a “police mutual aid” unit that the Evanston Police Department is a member of.

Protests have grown over the last several weeks at the west suburban facility, where ICE detainees have reported “dehumanizing” conditions while awaiting transfer to different locations. Recent demonstrations have included repeat appearances from Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and fellow congressional candidates Kat Abughazaleh and Bushra Amiwala. After continuously using tear gas and pepperballs against protesters directly in front of the facility, ICE pushed protests back by erecting an unauthorized fence around the building, which the Village of Broadview has demanded be removed.

The situation changed again Thursday evening, when the Illinois State Police announced that a “temporary Unified Command” has been established to “coordinate public safety measures” around the facility. A news release listed ISP and the Broadview Police Department as partnering with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the county’s Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.

The release included a map of Beach Street, where the ICE building is located, which labeled the middle of the street as a “restricted area” and the sides and sidewalks as “protest areas.” These areas were separated on the ground by concrete barriers placed by the Illinois Department of Transportation.

“The Unified Command is setting up designated areas where people can safely exercise their rights, which will support the safety of the public, and ensure vehicular traffic can safely access the roads in the area,” ISP said in its statement. “The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights.”

Intersection and traffic control

That area received little attention Friday morning, however, as both protesters and police concentrated farther south at the intersection of Harvard Street and 25th Avenue, which ICE vehicles used to enter and exit the facility.

From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities. These officers maintained a perimeter covering the entire intersection and restricted traffic along 25th Avenue, ensuring federal vehicles could move freely.

Throughout the day, numerous protesters were detained by both federal and non-federal officers. Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol commander-at-large, was present when federal agents charged into the crowd without provocation and detained several people, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was spotted on the Broadview facility’s roof in the morning as well.

Shortly before 11:15 a.m., a group of suburban police officers were deployed to the scene through the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS), specifically from its Mobile Field Force (MFF) designed to respond to “civil disturbances, union conflicts, public demonstrations” and other protest events, per its website. NIPAS is a suburban “police mutual aid” organization, meaning suburban members provide resources and personnel for deployment in incidents that exceed one member’s capacity.

EPD is a founding member of NIPAS, and as of June 2024 contributes seven officers to the MFF and six to the Emergency Services Team, which acts as a SWAT team. EPD Cmdr. Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.

NIPAS was not listed in the unified command’s initial press release, but the officers reportedly swapped in to relieve some state troopers from the scene.

A spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement that officers from the unified command “show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois.” The RoundTable on Friday, though, spotted multiple state troopers and NIPAS officers without names or ID numbers, wearing face masks, or both.

TRUST Act compliance

The heavy presence of state and local police, at times seen side-by-side and conversing with federal agents, led some people in the crowd and online to question whether the unified command was violating the Illinois TRUST Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement in Illinois from supporting or assisting civil immigration enforcement “in any capacity.” The law says this includes “collateral assistance” and specifically identifies “establishing a security or traffic perimeter surrounding such operations” as an example of banned activities.

State officials defended the operation, however, as concerning public safety rather than ICE actions. Pritzker’s spokesperson said the unified command “will prioritize public safety above all else and take steps to safeguard the First Amendment rights of the public.” In a separate statement, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul wrote that the command’s purpose is to “maintain public safety and the ability to lawfully exercise First Amendment rights — not to engage in federal immigration enforcement.”

“State and local law enforcement do not violate the TRUST Act by establishing and maintaining designated protest areas and ensuring the unobstructed use of public roads,” Raoul said, “even if federal immigration enforcement activity is occurring nearby.”

Abughazaleh and Amiwala, who were present again Friday morning along with Mayor Biss, strongly disagreed with the deployment. Abughazaleh said during a press conference with other residents and elected officials that the “very existence” of designated protest areas implies “there are places where our First Amendment rights do not apply.”

“I understand why the state police have been deployed. It’s to make sure that ICE doesn’t have unilateral control,” Abughazaleh told the RoundTable after the press conference. “At the same time, I worry that sets up a precedent that they [ICE] can do whatever they want. … What we’re asking at this press conference and in general is to follow the damn law.”

Amiwala said later Friday morning that local police should not be “collaborating” with ICE “either which way,” whether in arrests around the area or in protest control outside the Broadview facility.

“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said. “I think this should send alarm signals as well as a violation of the TRUST Act.”

Biss took a different stance: speaking to the RoundTable near the main protest just before 9 a.m., he said there “was a very dangerous situation brewing here” with ICE “trying to provoke reaction,” which necessitated the state stepping in.

“I think the state police are trying to keep protesters safe,” Biss said. “Protesters have been at risk here because of the outrageous violence [from ICE].”

The RoundTable’s interview with Biss was interrupted three separate times by protesters who recognized the mayor, two of whom rebuked his view on the unified command.

“If I’m elected, I’m gonna be fighting to abolish ICE,” Biss told one protester, “but there’s a million steps on the way from here to there — like they shouldn’t be masked, like they shouldn’t be violently attacking nonviolent demonstrators, but they also shouldn’t be kidnapping our neighbors, which is the worst part of this.”

“The question is, what’s the best way to stop the outrage of ICE kidnapping our neighbors?” he asked another demonstrator.

“Yeah, is this it?” the protester replied, referring to the unified command from state and regional police.

“I’m not sure,” Biss answered.

ICE violence elsewhere, National Guard imminent

Friday’s protest in Broadview didn’t include the tear gas and pepper spray of earlier weeks, but elsewhere in the region, ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents have continued escalating violence against residents and local officials in and around Chicago:

Early Tuesday morning, agents used helicopters and flash grenades in a militarized raid on an entire apartment building in South Shore, with apartment doors blown off and both adults and kids dragged into vans without clothes on.

On Wednesday, agents choked and arrested a Black man in East Garfield Park following a car crash.

On Friday, agents tear gassed an intersection in Logan Square near a grocery store and school, and detained a Chicago alderperson at Humboldt Park Hospital while she was trying to check on a resident injured in an ICE raid.

On Saturday, Border Patrol agents shot a woman in Brighton Park, claiming she was part of a group that “boxed in” patrolling agents and that she “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” claims which have not yet been independently verified by local media. Chicago police were deployed to separate the agents from an angry crowd of residents, and the agents later sped off while tear gassing both the residents and police present.

Finally, on Saturday, President Donald Trump issued an order to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard troops for local deployment, though it’s unclear when or they will be deployed. Notably, however, a federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to send the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a Saturday statement preempting the order. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Prtizker continued. “State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC0405-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 16:57:12.723048

""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment.","A federal judge in Portland, Ore. temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government didn't meet the threshold for declaring recent ongoing protests outside an ICE facility in Portland a rebellion. She noted in her ruling that the Portland Police Bureau's 812 officers are trained in crowd management and First Amendment law. She also noted their mutual aid agreements with neighboring law enforcement agencies, as well as with the Oregon State Police and federal law enforcement, signaling that they had protests well in hand.

""If additional resources beyond all of these are critically needed, PPB may request that Oregon's Governor provide National Guard resources for a locally declared emergency,"" she wrote.

Since July, the judge's ruling said, the protests generally were limited to fewer than 30 people and were ""largely sedate.""

The ruling stated the Trump administration ""presented evidence of sporadic violence against federal officers and property damage to a federal building."" Immergut wrote that the government has not, however, offered any evidence demonstrating that those violent incidents were part of an organized attempt ""to overthrow the government as a whole.""

Immergut was appointed by President Trump in 2019.

A broader lawsuit filed Sept. 28 by the city and state asking the courts to declare Trump's deployment unlawful will move forward separately on a slower track.

The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities. Trump has sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and will soon send them to Memphis, Tennessee with the state's approval.

He's threatened to send them to Chicago, despite objections from city and state leaders there. Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, meanwhile, has requested troops to help with ""high crime rates"" in cities like New Orleans.

President Trump has said the deployments are needed to protect ICE agents as they carry out his mass deportation operations, as well as to reduce street crime. That's even though crime in some of the cities mentioned has been going down – including in Portland. The deployment to California was the first time in 60 years – since they were sent to protect civil rights activists in Alabama -- that a president deployed the National Guard over the objections of a state's governor.

Trump turned to Portland last week

President Trump announced on Sept. 27 his plan to send troops to ""war ravaged Portland."" In his social media post, the president said he was ""authorizing Full Force, if necessary"" to deal with ""domestic terrorists."" Trump did not specify what he meant by ""Full Force.""

In court documents, the Trump administration argued it was necessary to federalize the National Guard to protect federal personnel at an ICE facility in Portland that has ""experienced significant unrest targeting both the facility itself and those who work in it.""

State and local officials reject the idea that the situation on the ground requires the National Guard – saying protests outside the ICE facility have been small with no arrests by Portland Police in months until Trump's decision to federalize Oregon's Guard.

By day, legal observers, clergy and leaders from other religious and spiritual denominations stand outside the building, prepared to assist people showing up for required ""check-ins"" with ICE officials. By night, a small group of protesters – sometimes a dozen or fewer – have demonstrated outside the building.

Typically, says Portland's Police Chief Bob Day, they have largely been nonviolent and contained.

""The city of Portland is 145 square miles. And this is one city block,"" Day told reporters Monday. ""And even the events that are happening down there do not rise to the level of attention that they are receiving.""

Local officials say the protests had already dwindled

The protests are much smaller than the scores of people who for months in 2020 gathered at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

On September 28, the State of Oregon and City of Portland sued to block the Trump administration from deploying troops to the state's largest city.

""In furtherance of a nationwide campaign to incorporate the military into civilian law enforcement—while also seeking to punish select, politically disfavored jurisdictions—they are preparing to deploy troops in Portland, Oregon,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote in their motion for a restraining order filed Monday. ""The facts do not remotely justify this overreach.""

In the same document, they said the Portland Police Bureau made 25 arrests at the ICE facility between June 11 and June 19 of this year, but hadn't had cause to make any more until administration announced they were deploying the National Guard. After the President's announcement Saturday, two more people were arrested Sunday. Cammilla Wamsley, a regional ICE supervisor, said in a sworn statement that federal law enforcement made more than 20 arrests over roughly three weeks this summer, separate from arrests by local police.

""On any given weekend,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote, ""the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has required PPB to dedicate greater resources than the small protests outside the ICE facility.""

Trump lawyers maintain federal agents are under threat

Lawyers for the administration countered in their own court documents that the deployment was justified because protests in Portland required the facility to close for about three weeks in June and July. They say protesters blocked the entrance, spray painted threats and doxed ICE agents online.

""Agitators have assaulted federal law enforcement officers with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices. They have damaged federal property, including by breaking office windows, security cameras, and card readers permitting entry to the building,"" they said.

On Friday, the administration announced it was investigating how Portland police have handled anti-ICE protests.

Records provided to the court by the city of Portland show throughout September before Trump made his announcement, protests rarely drew more than a few dozen people. The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.

There were nights with incidents, such as Sept 20 when Portland Police noted that a Federal Protective Service officer called them ""throughout the night with info about black blockers assaulting people."" ""Black bloc"" groups wear black clothing and face coverings.

But the records show the majority of nights were calm, like the night before Trump's Sept. 27 announcement to send in the National Guard, when Portland police observed 8-15 people at any given time: ""Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around."" Portland Police wrote, ""Energy was low, minimal activity.""

Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California

This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials. In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to confront protests against ICE operations. A federal judge ruled that the situation there did not constitute a level of interference with ICE or a ""rebellion"" against federal authority to justify sending in the troops.

But an appeals court overruled that finding, citing instances where ICE agents were ""pinned down"" and had ""concrete chunks"" and ""bottles of liquid"" thrown at them. Oregon officials tried to draw a distinction there.

""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment. ""If the relatively small, contained, and largely sedated protests near Portland's ICE facility in recent weeks can justify military intervention, then the President's authority to federalize a state's National Guard … would be virtually unlimited.""

On Sept. 2, a California judge ruled that the troops in Los Angeles violated long-standing law against military forces performing civilian law enforcement by assisting ICE agents with traffic control and cordons for their operations. That ruling is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles (375 square km) and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.

The government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.

We'll be ending our live coverage of this week's episode of Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg shortly. But before we do, let's catch you up on what we heard:

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was asked what the government will do to protect Jewish communities in the UK.

It comes after many said they were ""shocked, but not surprised"" by the attack on a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, which killed two Jewish men and left three others in a serious condition.

The home secretary pointed to a new announcement about expanding police powers to restrict repeat protests - but acknowledged that the government hasn't got the balance right yet.

Manchester rabbis Josh Levy and Kath Vardi told the programme that anti-Semitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

And as the Conservative Party conference looms, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch insisted that the her party's plans toremove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years will pay off.

Thanks for joining us.

Badenoch's policy proposals are shocking - and that's intentional

Harry Farley

Political correspondent, reporting from Manchester

The plan for a ""Removals Force"" is really quite radical when you look at the details. It's based on a controversial American model and would double the funding of the current unit in the Home Office.

The Conservatives have also promised an overhaul of the asylum system, with tighter restrictions on who could claim refuge. That’s all underpinned by a promise for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).

These are bold policies all designed to grab attention and restore confidence as the Conservative Party conference begins in Manchester.

But a number of Conservatives are worried about the impact leaving the ECHR might have on the UK's reputation.

Kemi Badenoch will be trying to address those internal critics who are still wondering whether she is the right person to lead the party forward.

Recap: What we heard this week

If you're just catching up, let's take a quick look back at what we heard on today's programme.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was pressed on the government's response to antisemitism in the wake of Thursday's attack in Manchester at a Jewish synagogue.

She said the investigation was progressing and she had been in touch with the families of the victims.

The home secretary said Jewish people are justified in their anger at the government, adding their concerns are informing proposed new police powers over protests. She insisted that people would still have freedom to protest, but the new laws would make sure the wider community was also protected.

We also heard from two Manchester-based Rabbis who said antisemitism had been allowed to grow in the UK, and they were not surprised by the attack on a synagogue.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that protest laws needed improvement, but questioned why it had taken the government so long to address them.

She was then asked about her plans to return 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK if the Conservatives win the next election. Badenoch insisted her plans, which include leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, ""were credible"".

She also spoke about rowing back on the UK's climate commitments to ensure the country wasn't losing out commercially to foreign rivals, and defended her record as party leader, saying she maintains the backing of party members.

Badenoch won't commit to resigning if Tories don't succeed in next election

Badenoch is pushed on her plans and leadership. The Conservative Party's position has gotten worse, Kuenssberg says.

But Badenoch pushes back and says polls are not results. She is instead taking time to work on plans that won't fall apart, she adds.

The final question from Kuenssberg is: ""What if the problem is you?""

Badenoch says she was elected to do ""exactly what I am doing now"" and she believes her party will keep faith.

Asked if she will resign if things go badly at the next elections in May, Badenoch repeats that she was elected to do what she is doing now.

With that, the interview concludes.

Badenoch says government climate plans not working

The interview now moves on to Tory policies on the climate.

Badenoch says the the government's plans are not working and not stopping climate change.

She says that we've made changes to comply with the Paris agreement, but the UK is the only country in the world who have done that. She then lists climate initiatives that she says are making other countries rich at the cost of the UK.

She says companies are leaving because of the UK's environmental laws and workers are losing their jobs.

Badenoch says human rights can be protected without ECHR membership

Turning now to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which the Conservatives said they would leave, Badenoch is asked if they really want the UK to leave a decades-old European agreement.

The Tory leader lists off countries including the US, Canada and Australia, saying they are not party to the ECHR. Kuenssberg points out these are not European countries.

Badenoch says you don't need to be in the convention to have human rights. ""Our human rights existed long before the ECHR,"" she argues.

She says the UK is paying money to handle a problem that's getting more difficult.

The Conservatives have not said they would leave the Refugee Convention, Badenoch says, but they will be prepared to leave anything stopping them from securing the borders.

'I want to make sure we have strong borders' - Badenoch

Pushed by Kuenssberg to offer a plan to remove illegal immigrants from the UK, Badenoch says the Conservatives will be standing up for a force - the Removals Force - which doesn't currently exist.

She says that families of children hurt by illegal migrants want to know why the government isn't acting.

Kuenssberg pushes back, asking Badenoch how the party will make it happen.

Badenoch says funding will come from the money currently spent on housing asylum seekers in hotels and ""dealing with migration issues"".

""I want to make sure that we have strong borders, and I've come up with a plan to do it,"" Badenoch says, admitting that it will be tough.

Badenoch insists Tory plan on migration is credible

Kuenssberg says that questioning where people have to go is not irrelevant, but Badenoch says we can't have a ""defeatist attitude"" and the Tories have a credible plan.

Badenoch is asked if it's a credible plan, where will the people go? She answers ""not here"".

""We need to have stronger borders"", Badenoch says. She says that the plans are not just about deporting 750,000 people, it's about leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims from people who have arrived illegally and the return scheme.

Where would migrants removed from UK go?

Kuenssberg moves onto the Conservative pledge to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election.

Where would they go? Kuenssberg asks Badenoch.

The Tory leader says there are too many people in the UK that shouldn't be here, and they need to go back to their countries. She adds that the Tories had a Rwanda plan ""that worked"".

Pushed again on where would people go, Badenoch says ""not here"".

""They should not be here, we need to look after the our people,"" she adds, calling the question of where they would go ""irrelevant"".

Badenoch asks why plan to restrict repeat protests 'took so long'

Laura Kuenssberg turns now to Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, ahead of the party's conference in Manchester over the next few days.

She begins by asking Badenoch if she backs the government's proposals over restricting repeated protests.

Badenoch says yes, but questions why it ""took so long"". She also questions why the public should trust Mahmood, after the home secretary protested outside a branch of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain in 2014 to call for it to stop stocking goods from Israeli settlements.

She adds that the Jewish community is very concerned that the government won't support them.

Rabbis say antisemitism allowed to grow in the UK

We're now hearing from Josh Levy and Kath Vardi, two rabbis from Manchester.

Levy says for many of the Jewish community, the synagogue attack was a ""matter of when, not if"".

It isn't normal to have to have security outside a place of worship, Levy tells Kuenssberg, and says antisemitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

The line between protesting and inciting hate is narrow, Kath Vardi adds, continuing that people need to be held responsible for the messages that they're shouting at protests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/9b4d/live/99140590-a1c9-11f0-aa4e-41121ee831f6.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 07:57:33.932013

WASHINGTON – This morning, Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, driving one of the vehicles, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxxing federal agents. She took defensive fire from CBP agents and has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in the custody of the FBI. The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming has been apprehended by law enforcement.

The scene became increasingly violent as more domestic terrorists gathered and began throwing smoke, gas, rocks, and bottles at DHS law enforcement. Another domestic terrorist was arrested for assaulting CBP at the scene. Following JB Prtizker’s refusal to allow local police to help secure the scene, Secretary Noem has deployed special operations teams to restore law and order.

As our ICE law enforcement was responding to the shooting, a domestic terrorist followed them and rammed their vehicle in an attempt to run them off the road. This individual has also been arrested and is in HSI custody.

An ICE vehicle popped a tire and was subsequently mobbed by domestic terrorists, forcing law enforcement to abandon the vehicle for their own safety. The vehicle was significantly damaged.

Several CBP law enforcement officers were sent to the hospital with various injuries.

Statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin:

“These attacks on our brave law enforcement officers must END. Secretary Noem has taken action to deploy additional resources to restore law and order. We will not allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement. If you law a hand on law enforcement, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Savage, www.latimes.com, david-g-savage",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-10-05/supreme-court-trump-claims-of-unchecked-power,"Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.
This year, Trump’s lawyers have confidently gone to Supreme Court with emergency appeals when lower-court judges have stood in their way.
The Supreme Court “has been a rubber stamp approving Trump’s actions,” said UC Berkeley law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.
That’s also why many legal experts think the year ahead will provide a better test of the Supreme Court and Trump’s challenge to the constitutional order.
Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.","Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts and his conservative colleagues have given no sign so far they will check President Trump’s one-man governance by executive order.

To the contrary, the conservative justices have repeatedly ruled for Trump on fast-track appeals and overturned federal judges who said the president had exceeded his authority.

The court’s new term opens on Monday, and the justices will begin hearing arguments.

But those regularly scheduled cases have been overshadowed by Trump’s relentless drive to remake the government, to punish his political enemies, including universities, law firms, TV networks and prominent Democrats, and to send troops to patrol U.S. cities.

The overriding question has become: Are there any legal limits on the president’s power? The Supreme Court itself has raised the doubts.

A year ago, as Trump ran to reclaim the White House, the justices blocked a felony criminal indictment against him related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, for which Trump was impeached.

Led by Roberts, the court ruled for Trump and declared for the first time that presidents were immune from being prosecuted for their official actions in the White House.

Not surprisingly, Trump saw this as a “BIG WIN” and proof there is no legal check on his power.

This year, Trump’s lawyers have confidently gone to Supreme Court with emergency appeals when lower-court judges have stood in their way. With few exceptions, they have won, often over dissents from the court’s three liberal Democrats.

Many court scholars say they are disappointed but not surprised by the court’s response so far to Trump’s aggressive use of executive power.

The Supreme Court “has been a rubber stamp approving Trump’s actions,” said UC Berkeley law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. “I hope very much that the court will be a check on Trump. There isn’t any other. But so far, it has not played that role.”

Roberts “had been seen as a Republican but not a Trump Republican. But he doesn’t seem interested or willing to put any limits on him,” said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler. “Maybe they think they’re saving their credibility for when it really counts.”

Acting on his own, Trump moved quickly to reshape the federal government. He ordered cuts in spending and staffing at federal agencies and fired inspectors general and officials of independent agencies who had fixed terms set by Congress. He stepped up arrests and deportations of immigrants who are here illegally.

But the court’s decisions on those fronts are in keeping with the long-standing views of the conservatives on the bench.

Long before Trump ran for office, Roberts had argued that the Constitution gives the president broad executive authority to control federal agencies, including the power to fire officials who disagree with him.

The court’s conservatives also think the president has the authority to enforce — or not enforce — immigration laws.

That’s also why many legal experts think the year ahead will provide a better test of the Supreme Court and Trump’s challenge to the constitutional order.

“Overall, my reaction is that it’s too soon to tell,” said William Baude, a University of Chicago law professor and a former clerk for Roberts. “In the next year, we will likely see decisions about tariffs, birthright citizenship, alien enemies and perhaps more, and we’ll know a lot more.”

In early September, Trump administration lawyers rushed the tariffs case to the Supreme Court because they believed it was better to lose sooner rather than later.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government could face up to a $1-trillion problem if the court delayed a decision until next summer and then ruled the tariffs were illegal.

“Unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he told the court.

The Constitution says tariffs, taxes and raising revenue are matters for Congress to decide. Through most of American history, tariffs funded much of the federal government. That began to change after 1913 when the 16th Amendment was adopted to authorize “taxes on incomes.”

Trump has said he would like to return to an earlier era when import taxes funded the government.

“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said at a rally after his inauguration in January. “Because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”

While he could have gone to the Republican-controlled Congress to get approval, he imposed several rounds of large and worldwide tariffs acting on his own.

Several small businesses sued and described the tariffs as “the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”

As for legal justification, the president’s lawyers pointed to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. It authorizes the president to “deal with any unusual or extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.”

The law did not mention tariffs, taxes or duties but said the president could “regulate” the “importation” of products.

Trump administration lawyers argue that the “power to ‘regulate importation’ plainly encompasses the power to impose tariffs.” They also say the court should defer to the president because tariffs involve foreign affairs and national security.

They said the president invoked the tariffs not to raise revenue but to “rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders.”

In response to lawsuits from small businesses and several states, judges who handle international trade cases ruled the tariffs were illegal. However, they agreed to keep them in place to allow for appeals.

Their opinion relied in part on recent Supreme Court’s decisions which struck down potentially far-reaching regulations from Democratic presidents on climate change, student loan debt and COVID-19 vaccine requirements. In each of the decisions, Roberts said Congress had not clearly authorized the disputed regulations.

Citing that principle, the federal circuit court said it “seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”

Trump said that decision, if allowed to stand, “could literally destroy the United States of America.” The court agreed to hear arguments in the tariffs case on Nov. 5.

A victory for Trump would be “viewed as a dramatic expansion of presidential power,” said Washington attorney Stephanie Connor, who works on tariff cases. Trump and future presidents could sidestep Congress to impose tariffs simply by citing an emergency, she said.

But the decision itself may have a limited impact because the administration has announced new tariffs last week that were based on other national security laws.

Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.

They did not seek a fast-track ruling, however. Instead, they said the court should grant review and hear arguments on the regular schedule early next year. If so, a decision would be handed down by late June.

The amendment says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States.”

And in the past, both Congress and the Supreme Court have agreed that rule applies broadly to all children who are born here, except if their parents are foreign ambassadors or diplomats who are not subject to U.S. laws.

But Trump Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer said that interpretation is mistaken. He said the post-Civil War amendment was “adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists and temporary visitors.”

Judges in three regions of the country have rejected Trump’s limits on the citizenship rule and blocked it from taking effect nationwide while the litigation continues.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29e0eff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6123x3215+0+435/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9e%2F831abe4e4ae69296cd11f8bb770d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2203860656,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:32.955435

,Policy,2025-10-05 11:16:41+00:00,Axios,How the U.S. bypassed rules to rush deportees to Africa - Axios,Brittany Gibson,,,,,https://www.axios.com/2025/10/05/us-trump-deport-criminals-africa,"It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.
A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S.
It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan.
In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.
Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.","The Trump administration's rush to quickly deport immigrants with criminal records has led U.S. officials to send several men to prisons in Africa even though their home countries would have taken them back, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: President Trump's team has justified deportations to prisons in Eswatini and South Sudan by claiming that no other countries — including the immigrants' homelands — would accept criminals ousted from the U.S.

But foreign government officials, immigration attorneys and court filings indicate that wasn't the case with at least two groups of deportees this summer that included a dozen migrants from Mexico, Vietnam and Jamaica who'd been convicted of crimes such as murder and robbery.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.

Zoom out: Unlike the hundreds of Venezuelans the Department of Homeland Security deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador — or the dozens of asylum seekers sent to Costa Rica and Panama — the two groups of deportees whose cases were examined by Axios had judges' orders to be removed from the U.S.

For such deportees, U.S. law requires judges to designate a preferred country or the deportee's country of origin as the priority destination.

A second option is for the deportee to be sent to a country with which he or she has ties. Deportation to a ""third country"" unfamiliar to the deportee is only a last resort.

What they're saying: ""The Trump administration has just skipped all of those steps"" and simply moved immigrants ""to a country that's willing to accept them — and that, we think, is a clear violation of statute,"" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney leading a class-action lawsuit againsst ""third country"" deportations.

""DHS does not have unfettered discretion to decide where to send noncitizens,"" one court document argues in the lawsuit.

""This is all meant to be a punitive stunt, fear-mongering stunt to play out in the media,"" Realmuto told Axios.

Zoom in: Eleven people were on the first flights to South Sudan and Eswatini despite having no ties to those countries, and several more were put on flights to Rwanda and Ghana, Axios' review of the cases found.

A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S. He's now been returned to Mexico.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan. ""Mexico accepts the returns of its nationals. Period. Full stop,"" said Anwen Hughes, an attorney for Human Rights First, who represented the man.

In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.

Jamaica's foreign minister said in a statement that her nation hadn't refused the return of any of its citizens from the U.S. The Jamaican deportee eventually was returned to his home country.

For a Vietnamese man deported to Eswatini and another deported to South Sudan, it appears U.S. immigration officials didn't notify Vietnam of its citizens' removals.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, an immigration attorney working on both men's cases, told Axios there's no evidence of U.S. officials requesting travel documents from the Vietnamese government, which typically starts the deportation process.

One of his clients was first told he was headed to Eswatini while sitting on the plane that was headed there, Nguyen said.

The latest: Officials in Eswatini and South Sudan now say they'll return all of the men to their native countries — eventually — despite the U.S. government's claims that wasn't possible.

""The repatriation process has already begun .... In, maybe, less than 12 months they should all be going back to their countries,"" Eswatini government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in an interview with South African Broadcasting.

South Sudan's foreign affairs ministry said it's also committed to returning the deportees that nation received to their home countries.

The other side: ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, you could end up in [El Salvador], Eswatini, South Sudan or another third country,"" U.S. Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Trisha McLaughlin said.

""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country,"" McLaughlin added.

""Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States. Illegal aliens who commit barbaric crimes are frequently not taken back by their home countries.""

What to watch: Texts of two ""third country"" agreements, obtained by Axios, indicate the U.S. could send hundreds more deportees to Africa in exchange for millions of dollars.

Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.

Rwanda signed up to be paid $7.5 million to accept 250 deportees in a deal signed on June 3.",https://images.axios.com/o_baC1Y6hHmkWthjf0s1XfAJ3h4=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/09/19/1758309886071.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:35.978265

After a three-month recess, the nine justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket, and discuss appeals that have piled up over the summer. The high court will resume oral arguments to confront issues like gender identity, election redistricting, and free speech.

But looming over the federal judiciary is the return of Trump-era legal battles. The administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January, that dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts — including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgender people in the military.

In doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

Now those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review — and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.

The justices fast-tracked the administration’s appeal over tariffs on dozens of countries that were blocked by lower courts. Oral arguments will be held in November.

In December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.

And in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in a major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.

""A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question: ‘can President Trump do?’— then fill in the blank. And that could be imposing tariffs; firing independent board members; removing illegal aliens; sending the military into cities like Los Angeles,"" said Thomas Dupree, a prominent appellate attorney and constitutional law expert. ""So, much of what the Supreme Court is deciding this term is whether the president has acted within or has exceeded his authority.""

The tariffs dispute will be the court's first major constitutional test on the merits over how broadly the conservative majority high court views Trump's muscular view of presidential power, a template for almost certain future appeals of his executive agenda.

Presidential prerogative or power push?

In earlier disputes over temporary enforcement of those policies, the court's left-leaning justices warned against the judiciary becoming a rubber stamp, ceding its power in favor of this president.

After a late August high court order granting the government the power to temporarily terminate nearly $800 million in already-approved health research grants, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said her conservative colleagues had ""ben[t] over backward to accommodate"" the Trump administration. ""Right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints, the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.""

But some of Jackson's colleagues have denied they are paving the way for Trump's aggressive efforts to redo the federal government.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT WEIGHS TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER AS ADMIN OUTLINES ENFORCEMENT DETAILS

""The framers recognized, in a way that I think is brilliant, that preserving liberty requires separating the power,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh earlier this month at a Texas event. ""No one person or group of people should have too much power in our system.""

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Fox News' Bret Baier three weeks ago that she and her colleagues ""don't wear red and blue, we all wear black because judges are nonpartisan ... We're all trying to get it right. We're not playing for a team.""

Barrett, who is promoting her new book, ""Listening to the Law,"" said her court takes a long-term view, and is not reflexively on Trump's side.

""We're not deciding cases just for today. And we're not deciding cases based on the president, as in the current occupant of the office,"" Barrett told Fox News. ""I think the judiciary needs to stay in its lane ... we're taking each case and we're looking at the question of presidential power as it comes. And the cases that we decide today are going to matter, four presidencies from now, six presidencies from now.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

These sharp court fractures between competing ideologies will likely escalate, as the justices begin a more robust look at a president's power, and by dint, their own.

Divisive decisions

""He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,"" Trump cryptically posted on social media a month after retaking office.

Federal courts have since been trying to navigate and articulate the limits of the executive branch, while managing their own powers.

Yet several federal judges — appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents — have expressed concern that the Supreme Court has been regularly overturning rulings by lower courts dealing with challenges to Trump administration policies — mostly with little or no explanation in its decisions.

Those judges — who all requested anonymity to speak candidly — tell Fox News those orders blocking enforcement have left the impression they are not doing their jobs or are biased against the President.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TORPEDOES SCOTUS WITH EMERGENCY REQUESTS AND SEES SURPRISING SUCCESS

Those frustrations have spilled into open court.

""They’re leaving the circuit courts, the district courts out in limbo,"" said federal appeals Judge James Wynn about the high court, during oral arguments this month over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security data.

""We're out here flailing,"" said Wynn, an Obama bench appointee. ""I'm not criticizing the justices. They're using a vehicle that’s there, but they are telling us nothing. They could easily just give us direction, and we would follow it.""

Courting controversy

The president may be winning short-term victories in a court where he has appointed a third of its members, but that has not stopped him or his associates from criticizing federal judges, even calling for their removal from office when preliminary rulings have gone against the administration.

""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!"" Trump posted on social media, after a March court ruling temporarily halting the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

The target of the attack was DC-based Chief Judge James Boasberg, appointed to the bench by President Obama.

Top Trump White House policy advisor Stephen Miller, in interviews, has warned against some unaccountable and ""communist crazy judges"" ""trying to subvert the presidency.""

TRUMP TURNS TO SUPREME COURT IN FIGHT TO OUST BIDEN-ERA CONSUMER SAFETY OFFICIALS

According to ananalysis by Stanford University's Adam Bonica, federal district judges ruled against the administration 94.3% of the time between May and June.

But the Supreme Court has in turn reversed those injunctions more than 90% of the time, giving the president temporary authority to move ahead with his sweeping reform agenda.

As for the rhetoric, the high court has walked a delicate path, reluctant to criticize Trump directly, at least for now.

""The fact that some of our public leaders are lawyers advocating or making statements challenging the rule of law tells me that, fundamentally, our law schools are failing,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor at a recent Georgetown University Law Center event, without naming Trump by name. ""Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely.""

Chief Justice John Roberts in March offered a rare public statement criticizing impeachment calls from the right.

But several federal judges who spoke to Fox News also wish Roberts would do more to assert his authority and to temper what one judge called ""disturbing"" rhetoric.

The U.S. Marshals Service — responsible for court security — reports more than 500 threats against federal judges since last October, more than in previous years. Law enforcement sources say that includes Boasberg, who, along with his family, has received physical threats and intimidating social media posts.

TURLEY: JUSTICE JACKSON SHOWS ‘JUDICIAL ABANDON’ IN LONE DISSENT ON TRUMP LAYOFF RULING

""I think it is a sign of a culture that has, where political discourse has soured beyond control,"" said Justice Barrett in recent days.

""The attacks are not random. They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity,"" said Justice Jackson in May. ""The threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy, on our system of government.""

The administration in recent days asked Congress for $58 million more in security for executive branch officials and judges, following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who led Turning Point USA.

Testy term awaits

A Fox News poll from this summer found 47% of voters approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, a 9-point jump since last year when a record low 38% approved.

""Over the past decade, public confidence in our major institutions has declined,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps conduct the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""The Court’s rebound could reflect its attempts to steer a middle course on politically polarizing questions or indicate an uptick in positive attitudes toward our more venerable institutions.""

Still, by more than 2-to-1, more voters think the court is too conservative (43%) than too liberal in its decisions (18%, a low), while 36% think the court’s rulings are about right. That continues a seven-year trend.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

The public's views of the court's ability to steer clear of politics will be tested this term.

Besides the two Trump-related appeals, the justices are already scheduled to decide:

At least two appeals involving LGBTQ+ rights: which public school sports teams transgender students can join; and state laws banning so-called ""conversion therapy"" for minors who may have gender identity or sexual orientation issues.

Two election-related disputes involving partisan gerrymandering and federal campaign spending coordination that each could have major impacts on the 2026 midterms and beyond.

Precedent on a precipice

But court watchers are pointing to several hot-button pending appeals where ""stare decisis"" or respect for established landmark court rulings will be tested: same-sex marriage and communal school prayer.

The high court is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to put those petitions on its argument calendar, with possible rulings on the merits by June 2026.

But other cases are already awaiting a final ruling: the use of race in redistricting under the Voting Rights Act; and independent government boards.

""I think the likeliest candidates for being revisited are the ones that involve the power of the president to fire the heads of federal agencies,"" said attorney Dupree. ""This is an old precedent that's been on the books really back since the New Deal, and it's come into question in recent years. There's been a long shadow hanging over these decisions, and I think the Supreme Court is poised to revisit those this term and in all likelihood overrule that.""

The court may have already set the stage, by using the emergency docket in recent weeks to allow Trump to temporarily fire members of several other independent federal agencies without cause. The court's liberal wing complained that giving the president that power without explanation effectively unravels the 1935 precedent known as ""Humphrey's Executor.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

""Today’s order favors the president over our precedent,"" said Justice Elena Kagan in a blistering dissent against Trump's removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board.

The court's ""impatience to get on with things — to now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also the most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover (and maybe ever) — must reveal how that eventual decision will go"" on the merits, added Kagan.

Sotomayor said recent overturned precedents were ""really bad"" for certain groups of people.

""And that’s what’s at risk, is in each time we change precedent, we are changing the contours of a right that people thought they had,"" she said this month. ""Once you take that away, think of how much more is at risk later. Not just in this situation.""

The conservative justices in recent years have not been shy about revisiting cases that had been settled for decades but now have been overturned: the nationwide right to abortion, affirmative action in education and the discretionary power of federal agencies.

Other pending issues the justices may soon be forced to confront which could upset longstanding precedent include libel lawsuits from public officials, flag burning and Ten Commandments displays in public schools.

One justice who has been more willing than his benchmates to overrule precedents may be its most influential: Justice Clarence Thomas.

""I don’t think that any of these cases that have been decided are the gospel,"" Thomas said last week at a Catholic University event.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.
Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.
Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.
As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.","Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the country needed to “send a very clear signal” that anyone arriving illegally had “zero chance of making a life in the UK”.

He told the Sunday Express: “We have to secure our borders and we have got to bring the numbers of people coming into our country right down and give everyone breathing space.”

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/resources/images/20038062.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-10-05 11:56:20.289009

(KOIN) — Federal agents took several protesters into custody and deployed gas and pepper balls at least three times against a crowd of hundreds who gathered for a demonstration in front of the Portland ICE facility Saturday afternoon.

There was a noticeable contingent of counter-protesters among those gathered at the ICE facility throughout the day.

The events initially began as a march from Elizabeth Caruthers Park to the ICE facility organized primarily by Portland Contra Las Deportaciones (PDXCD).

One of the protesters into taken into custody was Holly Brown, one of the organizers of the march.

Brown, who was released around 5:30 p.m., said it was “really horrible inside.”

“There’s different holding cells with, like, really harsh fluorescent lights. There’s no bedding. It’s just like concrete. And the phones didn’t work. They didn’t have phones working in the entire facility,” Brown told KOIN 6 News. “There’s, all these different, like, posters on the wall encouraging people to self-deport. It’s a really horrible, horrible place.”

She said she was charged with trespassing on federal property.

KOIN 6 News saw at least one other person released from ICE custody. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to a KOIN 6 News request for details on how many people were arrested on Saturday.

The mood temporarily cooled down after the initial use of tear gas and protesters were seen dancing in the street. Then at round 3 p.m., after some vehicles were let through the streets near the facility, federal agents deployed more gas against protesters.

Dozens of pepper balls were also deployed by federal agents around 7 p.m. Then, shortly before 9 p.m., KOIN 6 News saw federal agents tear gas groups of people who were blocks away from the ICE facility.

“What we did not expect in the targeted arrests was the full-on pushing that they did,” protester Rainbow told KOIN 6 News. “In the pushing, I ended up getting clocked in the eye by one of the federal agents, then they started tear gassing really bad.”

Rainbow said she saw an elderly couple in the group of protesters. The woman got hit in the head with a tear gas canister and began bleeding, eventually receiving help from medics. Rainbow claimed federal agents “tear-gassed the heck out of” the man who was using a walker to move around.

Rainbow added that since there were elderly people in the group who marched, they were not expecting this level of force.

“Pepper bullets? Yeah. Tear gas? no,” she said.

A large presence of Portland police were also observed in full gear and staged a few blocks away from the ICE facility.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/ice-facility-macadam-h-10042025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:05.681503

I insist on differentiating between a created concern and a real concern.","MadridA week after the Congress of Deputies rejected the delegation of immigration powers to the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and the PP proposed a ""points-based visa"" to control new arrivals, ARA interviewed the minister in charge, Elma Saiz.

We don't know when the next elections will be, but it seems that immigration will be one of the main topics of debate. Why?

— This is happening not only in Spain, but across all international agendas. For example, President [Donald] Trump's migration policy is instilling fear and causing pain. In Spain, we are committed to implementing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum from a humanist perspective. Migratory flows are inherent to human beings, not only because of the complex international context we are currently experiencing, but also because of climate change, so it's important to consider how migration policy is managed.

Last week, the People's Party (PP) proposed a points-based visa. What do you think?

— If you can call them proposals... The PP twisted and presented a reality that doesn't fit with what's happening. They talk about uncontrolled migration, and the figures refute this. Illegal arrivals represent only 6% of the total. We're looking at affiliation data in which foreigners play a very important role. These two issues alone dismantle the false narrative that the PP is trying to present about uncontrolled migration. They're trying to create new proposals, but what they are is a bravado of xenophobia and racism. The points-based visa is a regulatory aberration that contravenes European regulations and the Constitution, and is discriminatory. Mr. [Alberto Núñez] Feijóo would do well not to be swayed by misinformation and lies in the purest far-right style.

Is there first-class and second-class immigration?

— This is what the far right and the People's Party (PP) are playing with. They're trying to instill in society the idea that foreigners come to collect a state allowance, when the regulations themselves, for example, regarding the minimum living wage, require legal residency for at least one year. And they're also playing on the perception that there is a much larger foreign population, when the data doesn't reflect this; or on the perception that 40% are unemployed. It's important to dismantle this with data.

Is the right successfully setting the agenda on immigration?

— They're not setting the agenda. What's happening is that the PP has chosen to buy into the far-right's framework and create an irresponsible opposition. The reality is stubborn: Spain is a land of opportunity. Various international organizations assess the macroeconomic data and point out that they are sustained by the dynamic migration. This is what's setting the agenda. And the opposition, in a supreme exercise of irresponsibility, is trying to follow what the far-right dictates, because what they're doing is competing electorally with Vox. [...] I would say to Feijóo that if your rhetoric is like Vox's or if your policies are like Vox's, PP voters, when they have to make a decision, will vote for Vox.

For the welfare state, what does the migration phenomenon represent: a threat, a challenge, or an opportunity?

— What impoverishes our country is the extreme right's way of seeing life and its policies. I don't like to speak only in economic terms, but various organizations have estimated the need for some 300,000 foreign workers each year to sustain our welfare state. And it's a reality that there are more than 3 million foreign Social Security affiliates, another 20,000 in the last month, and 200,000 in the last year. Furthermore, we are an eminently foreign country. Before a Senegalese or a Latin American arrived, our grandparents sought a life abroad, fleeing the war.

Has a dehumanizing debate on immigration been established?

— The fight against hate speech on social media is very important, and the major platforms have taken a step forward and are aware that it is necessary to be much more forceful because it dehumanizes the migrant population, which can spread to society. We saw this this summer in Torre Pacheco. That's why speeches like Feijóo's in Murcia, in which there was not a shred of humanity in a context marked by the genocide in Gaza, are irresponsible.

Together speaks of a feeling of grievance because there are immigrant families who receive lunch scholarships and, on the other hand, families native are excluded. Should Catalonia increase investment in public services and social policies?

— Never before have so many resources been placed in the hands of the autonomous communities so they can assume and address their responsibilities. On migration policy, an important agreement has been reached between the PSOE and Junts, and I find it very positive and noteworthy that an autonomous community wants to take a step forward in assuming certain responsibilities in an issue as complex as migration policy.

But is the talk of grievance justified?

— But, look. Let's look at the housing issue, for example, in Catalonia. There is a state housing law that the autonomous communities must comply with. In Barcelona, ​​specifically, housing prices have dropped by 9% because it has been declared a stressed area. This is a reflection of institutional collaboration to respond to citizens' needs. In contrast, in Madrid, Mrs. [Isabel Díaz] Ayuso is addressing not those who have problems accessing housing, but investment funds, telling them that this is the best time and place to invest. It's important to see different ways of facing reality. And what has to do with the growth in membership also translates to Catalonia. There are more people working, more people who can develop their life plans in better conditions.

What self-criticism should left-wing forces engage in to prevent certain discourses from being imposed?

— I think it's important to analyze the agreement reached between the parties. An agreement that puts it in black and white, beyond discourses that may be shared more or less, or may not be shared at all. This is an agreement that speaks of protecting the vulnerable, of a social contract that grants rights and responsibilities to the entire population, that speaks of human rights, and that speaks of exciting future projects. This is the reality, the agreements that are being reached. And, of course, we must combat the misinformation that could link the migrant population to issues that are not in line with reality.

Are you worried that a party like Aliança Catalana will drag Junts into the far-right?

— What gives me confidence is the migration agreement between the PSOE and Junts. I'm familiar with the text, which has received a lot of opinions, but I don't know if it's been read enough. The Generalitat (Catalan government) and local governments are much more familiar with the productive fabric, the needs of businesses and workers, so it makes sense for them to participate in circular immigration programs with third countries. Or, for example, to facilitate the bureaucratic process with a one-stop shop. These agreements are made to move toward a more effective policy and to put human rights at the center and combat any kind of racism or xenophobia that some people want to instill.

Do you trust Junts not to buy the Aliança framework?

— What seems important to me is the agreement [on the delegation of powers] signed with Junts.

Will they try to bring the delegation of powers back to Congress, or will they look for other avenues?

— Political parties must take a stand. The [Spanish] government will continue working to move forward and fulfill the agreements.

The number of migrants arriving in the Balearic Islands is increasing, and the Balearic government is pointing to a lack of resources. Could a situation like the one in the Canary Islands be a possibility?

— These situations are not at all comparable; the numbers are completely irrelevant. Furthermore, I want to point out that in recent weeks, a significant emergency declaration was approved very quickly, with more than 7 million euros allocated to strengthen and adapt facilities to provide an appropriate response to the Balearic Islands.

I mentioned the events in Torre Pacheco earlier. Is Spanish society racist?

— No. I think it's the far right that's trying to disrupt our coexistence and, with their outlook on life and policies, trying to make us a poorer country socially and economically. But Spanish society isn't racist.

When families are uncomfortable with their children attending school with children of foreign origin, does this reflect a society that is not prepared for demographic change and that, at its core, racism does exist?

— We analyzed the CIS (Central Statistics Institute). A year ago, we asked if migration was a concern, and we saw that the number of people who considered it a concern was significant. On the contrary, when we asked if it concerned them in their daily lives, the number plummeted. Today, a year later, it's only a problem above others for 3.2% of the population. That's why a created concern is not the same as a real concern. When in Jumella (Murcia), the PP and Vox prohibit the use of a sports center for a Muslim celebration, violating freedom of worship, it is disrupting coexistence in a population where there is no problem. I insist on differentiating between a created concern and a real concern.

In Barcelona the so-called grow expatsBut there's no debate from a migration perspective. Is there a class bias?

— Absolutely. We can see it in the case of minors. Since Putin invaded Ukraine, more than 7,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived from the country. All the regions have done their best to welcome them. This hasn't made any headlines, nor has it sparked any controversy, nor has it become politicized. Instead, we're seeing how the PP-led regions are refusing [to welcome other unaccompanied minors]. Furthermore, they're lying because they're trying to convey the narrative that there are communities that aren't included in the reception scheme, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country.

On Thursday, we learned the new membership figures. What jobs are being created?

— Job creation goes hand in hand with quality. Incidentally, in Catalonia, 19% of the workforce is foreign, five percentage points above the Spanish average. We've managed to correct problems in our labor market, and this hasn't come out of the blue. It's the result of implementing policies in the right direction.

The ILP (Proposal for a Legalization of Half a Million Migrants) remains blocked in Congress. Is the Spanish government considering expediting the process through other means?

— It's a task for the political parties. It's in Congress where it should be debated.

A new contribution scheme for the self-employed is being negotiated. Will there be an agreement before the end of the year?

— Yes, I'm optimistic. Meetings are taking place frequently, and all the stakeholders who need to be there are present. Two important issues are on the table: improving access to cessation of activity and issues related to priority.

There's also no agreement on progressive sick pay for workers. This has raised concerns among unions about whether they're buying into employers' narratives about absenteeism. Do you think some workers are taking advantage of sick pay?

— I wouldn't put the focus on workers. Health is the focus, and no one in that country can work while on sick leave. We're putting measures on the table to advance the improvement of rights, and this has to do with this gradual reinstatement once discharged.

How do you ensure that workers are not pressured to return for fear of losing their job?

— A worker cannot work while on sick leave; they can only return to work when they receive a doctor's release. We're talking about a return to work that isn't from zero to one hundred percent, but rather progressive. For example, after a cancer treatment, under medical criteria, a worker can return to work gradually. I insist: medical criteria, voluntary return, and the health of workers are at the heart of the proposal.

Are you confident of closing the deal before the end of the year?

— I am an optimist.

Your predecessor, José Luis Escrivá, said in an interview with ARA that in Spain ""a cultural change is needed to ensure that people work more between the ages of 55 and 75"" and avoid early retirement. Do you agree with this?

— It's important to keep in mind the voluntary nature of decisions, ensuring that they have nothing to do with insufficient pensions. Extending the retirement age or working a few hours and counting them toward your pension, which is what we're talking about, cannot be conditioned on insufficient benefits. That's why it's so important to revalue pensions, guaranteeing security for pensioners and offering voluntary options to also take advantage of senior talent. The way we live, work, and life expectancy have changed.

Regarding the revaluation of salaries. Do you understand why young people are wary when an income agreement is requested and salaries are raised by 2% or 3% and the maximum pension by 8.5%?

— Trying to pit the elderly against their grandchildren is a perverse and dangerous war. Young people should know that many of the policies we are implementing are aimed at them: the minimum wage, extending maternity and paternity leave to 19 weeks... But, evidently, we are committed to guaranteeing this pension revaluation by law. Pensioners don't appear overnight; they are people who have been contributing to the system for 30 or 40 years, and we must provide them with security, social justice, and guarantee their pensions.

Is the Spanish government doing everything it can [in the face of the conflict] in Gaza?

— It's the government in the world that's doing the most to promote the resolution of both states, to achieve peace in Gaza, to demand an end to the genocide, to protect the flotilla through consular and diplomatic work.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State.","Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has notched a run of wins at the Supreme Court, which has overturned or stayed multiple lower-court rulings. These emergency rulings, typically brief, unsigned orders, have served to greatly expand the power of the presidency and remove constraints on the executive branch.

Now, as the Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday, the legal basis of these rulings is facing fresh scrutiny. The nine justices, of whom three were appointed in President Donald Trump’s first term, must issue conclusive, reasoned rulings on some of Mr. Trump’s most controversial policies, from emergency tariffs to birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement. The stakes are high for the administration, the contours of U.S. democracy, and for the court itself, which faces searing questions about its political tilt and institutional integrity.

If the emergency docket was a pit stop, the 2025-26 term is when the rubber meets the road.

Why We Wrote This

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has granted his administration an unprecedented 30 emergency docket rulings. With the new term opening Monday, the justices must now begin to explain the legal reasoning behind their decisions.

“This is an administration in a hurry. It tries to push all obstacles out of its way,” says Joseph Kobylka, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University. He adds, “This is an administration that is incredibly aggressive about advancing executive power.”

The nation’s highest court will be in the spotlight in an era of rising polarization and distrust. More than half of Americans disapprove of how the Supreme Court does its job, according to Gallup, with a 65-point gap between how Republicans and Democrats view the conservative-dominated court. (Gallup found 43% of those it polled in September see the body as “too conservative.”)

Perhaps the biggest question of all is how an unpopular court would muster its own legitimacy to stand up to the president, if his actions were unlawful. And if it does, would it risk seeing its rulings ignored or sidestepped, potentially upending the rule of law it is tasked to uphold?

“The court is terrified of having a head-on confrontation with the executive branch and making an order that the president won’t follow,” says Dan Farbman, an associate professor of constitutional law at Boston College. “What we’re going to see is a balance between the court’s institutional power, how much power it feels like it has, how many powers it’s willing to exert, and [its] legal reasoning.”

There have already been reported instances of noncompliance by the administration with federal court orders, notes Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago. This implicitly puts pressure on the Supreme Court not to confront the executive, since officials are suggesting they are willing to defy rulings that go against them, he says. But this political pressure makes it all the more important to impose lawful constraints – and to see that they are carried out.

“A world in which the executive threatens something and the court accedes regardless of the legality of the thing in question is just as bad as a world in which the executive doesn’t obey court orders,” says Professor Huq, who teaches constitutional law.

There are different views on whether people should trust the court intrinsically. Some people believe the court should be viewed as legitimate, regardless of its decisions, and others think the court is legitimate only when they agree with rulings, says Professor Huq.

The Supreme Court was viewed “with a large measure of distrust” by state courts before the Civil War, he says. “An interesting contrast today is you have this rumbling distrust coming not from state courts ... but from lower court judges.”

Examining the court’s legitimacy as a legislative check shouldn’t be conflated with whether its decisions are viewed as right or wrong politically, says Thomas Berry, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies. “Even the justices shouldn’t like the policy outcome of every case they’re deciding, because legal questions are often different from policy questions.”

What is Humphrey’s Executor and why does it matter?

Among the politically charged cases on the docket for this term, which runs through next June, are the firings of commissioners at independent federal agencies. The administration argues that these agencies are part of the executive branch and that board members serve as the president’s pleasure. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, has held that appointees can only be removed for malfeasance and neglect of duty.

Conservative justices have said, however, that this precedent should be revisited. Judicial activists on the right have long sought to defang agencies that they view as overly independent and duplicative in ways that have exacerbated federal government bloat.

“You have a majority of the Supreme Court that pretty clearly disagrees with Humphrey’s Executor but has not yet overruled it,” says Mr. Berry.

The Trump administration has fired senior officials at several independent agencies. One, Rebecca Slaughter, an appointee at the Federal Trade Commission, successfully sued against her removal; her case, which was upheld on appeal, has been accepted by the Court. (Two other board members of independent agencies have asked for their firings to be reviewed.)

A separate employment case concerns Lisa Cook, a governor at the Federal Reserve, whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of improper mortgage documentation. After she sued, a lower court ruled that she should stay in her position; the Trump administration wants the Court to overturn that decision. Analysts say the Supreme Court may be less inclined to lessen the Federal Reserve’s independence, given its stature as a linchpin in the U.S. economy. (Ms. Cook remains in her post; the Court will hold hearings in January.)

Are President Trump’s tariffs constitutional?

Another case with broad economic consequences concerns the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Most of the tariffs imposed on foreign-made goods since January have been under a 1977 Act of Congress that had never been used for this purpose. The White House argues that its declaration of a national emergency under the act allows it to impose global tariffs.

“It’s hard to argue that this isn’t the most important case of the term,” says Mr. Berry. (Cato has filed amicus curiae briefs in federal court contesting the tariffs.)

How the Supreme Court decides the tariffs case, which lower courts have found unlawful, will have practical as well as constitutional implications. Importers have already paid hundreds of billions of dollars to the government that they would seek to recoup if the emergency tariffs are struck down, potentially widening the federal deficit. Administration officials have said they would find other ways to impose tariffs if they lose the case which will be heard in November.

Michael McConnell, a former appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush, has compared the tariffs case with a 1952 ruling, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that President Harry Truman couldn’t take control of steel mills to supply armaments for the Korean War. It laid down the principle, Mr. McConnell wrote in a New York Times op-ed, that “even in an emergency, the president cannot take upon himself powers that are granted neither by the Constitution nor by congressional statute.”

If the Trump tariffs are upheld, it would, by contrast, “be a major step toward a presidency that does whatever the president wishes to do,” wrote Professor McConnell, who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University.

What will happen with birthright citizenship?

Perhaps the most controversial, and to many legal scholars the most tendentious, case involves the administration’s efforts to end birthright citizenship. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, states that all persons “born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

In a Jan. 20 executive order, Mr. Trump ordered that children born in the U.S. not automatically qualify for citizenship if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. A flurry of lawsuits followed, resulting in nationwide court injunctions against the order. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the use of nationwide injunctions, but didn’t rule on the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship. The justices, however, left the door open to a class action suit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed. Multiple judges subsequently blocked the executive order from taking effect. Last week, the Trump administration asked the court to rule on the merits of its interpretation of the 14th Amendment.

The court ruling on court injunctions was a technical parsing of law that sidestepped the political minefield of who is and isn’t a citizen. But if the court does, as expected, take up the birthright case, it would be a stiff test of the porous divide between law and politics, say legal scholars.

“The court takes great pains, and Chief Justice Roberts has tried to do this in his opinions and public statements, to say the court is not a political entity but a legal entity,” says Professor Kobylka. Its institutional legitimacy rests, in part, on the idea that it’s above politics. But that idea is increasingly challenged both by its partisan tilt and rising public skepticism.

The unprecedented use of the emergency docket by this administration – 30 grants of emergency relief so far – has ratcheted up this tension, says Professor Huq.

In one such emergency ruling, the Supreme Court recently overturned a California district court ruling that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had unlawfully used racial profiling in its dragnet for unauthorized immigrants. In another ruling in July, the justices allowed the administration to proceed with mass firings of federal workers.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State. By contrast, in the lower federal courts, “you have a mix ideologically of Republicans and Democrats deciding against Trump in about 95% of cases,” says Professor Huq.

Conservatives argue that federal justices in blue states, where many lawsuits are filed, are overreaching by obstructing the Trump administration. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, has called this a “failed lower court revolt” that threatens the judicial order. He noted that Mr. Trump also faced pushback in his first term from lower-court judges.

“As soon as Trump began his second term, federal judges resumed their skepticism of everything Trump does. But what’s different this time is that the Boston [Brahmin] of the judiciary, determined to save the rule of law, are pushing back against the Supreme Court itself,” wrote Professor Blackman, who serves on a Trump-appointed advisory board on religious liberty.

Other scholars say these cases result from confusion, not defiance: Emergency rulings by the court that overturn federal court decisions, for example, on the removal of agency officials, without formally overturning the 1935 precedent, leave lower-court judges unsure how to apply the law.

Full hearings, followed by formal rulings that supersede the shadow docket, would end this dilemma while also pitching the Supreme Court into the political arena, where it prefers not be.

“Right now, the court’s been able to sort of give the administration a break without having to fully defend itself, to defend its reasons. But when it finally decides these cases, it has to actually write up the reasons for what they’re doing. And that could mean big changes in constitutional law, or it could mean a confrontation with the president,” says Professor Farbman.",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/10/1003_NNEWTERM_LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:19.385314

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality.","BOSTON -- A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that President Donald Trump cannot enforce his executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily. The court on Friday joined four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" wrote Chief Judge David Barron. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

As The New York Times reported late Friday, a presidential determination dated September 30 and signed by President Donald Trump showed that the president aims to cap refugee admissions at 7,500 in 2026 — a significant decrease from the 40,000 that he previously discussed with officials, and from the 125,000 cap set by the Biden administration last year.

A White House official told the Times that the refugee limit would be final only after the administration consults with Congress, as it’s required to do under the Refugee Act. They added that consultation with the House and Senate Judiciary committees will be possible only after Democrats and Republicans reach a deal to fund the government and end the shutdown that began October 1.

But advocates and Democrats have pointed out in recent days that the White House’s deadline for consulting with lawmakers on refugee limits for next year was September 30, before the shutdown began.

As the deadline passed this week, Democratic leaders said that “in open defiance of the law, the Trump administration has failed to schedule the legally required consultation.”

“Despite repeated outreach from Democratic and Republican committee staff, the Trump administration has completely discarded its legal obligation, leaving Congress in the dark and refugees in limbo,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement; Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee; and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), ranking member for the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration.

The president effectively suspended the U.S. State Department’s 40-year-old refugee resettlement program on his first day in office. The program requires refugees fleeing conflict, famine, and persecution to pass background checks and medical exams before entering the country, and often involves yearslong waits in refugee camps before they are resettled in the U.S.

“What began as a so-called ‘suspension’ has now stretched into an eight-month shutdown, betraying the nation’s promise as a refuge for the oppressed,” said the Democrats. “Nearly 130,000 people facing persecution abroad who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements of our refugee program have been abandoned by this administration, left to languish in refugee camps around the world after being given the promise of safety and a new life in America.”

But for white South African farmers, also known as Afrikaners, Trump carved out an exception earlier this year that will reportedly be extended into 2026 — allowing them “to skip the line and rigorous vetting as countless others are shut out of the U.S.,” said the Democrats.

Trump and his billionaire megadonor, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have helped spread false claims that the country’s democratically elected Black government has systematically oppressed white Afrikaners, who enforced a racist apartheid system until 1994, and has allowed white farmers to be murdered — saying white people in the country face a “genocide.”

White South Africans hold 20 times the wealth of Black people in the country despite making up just 7% of the population, and control the vast majority of land.

“Poor Black citizens of South Africa are far more likely to be victims of violent crime and murder than white people,” wrote Joe Walsh at Current Affairs last year, noting that during one period, “when there were 49 murders on farms across the entire country, one of Cape Town’s predominantly Black townships called Khayelitsha recorded 179 murders, at a rate of approximately 116 per 100,000 people.”

While Trump plans to open the door to thousands of white South Africans, said Danilo Zak, director of policy at Church World Service, “more than 100,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, etc., who have been through years of vetting, approved, [are] now left stranded.”

With Trump’s determination on refugee numbers “already signed and dated,” said Zak, it’s impossible for Trump to have completed an “appropriate consultation” with Congress to approve the abandonment of refugees across the world.

Trump previously set a record low number for refugee admissions during his first term, imposing a cap of 15,000 slots for resettlement.

The new plan was reported as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the second time in four months in favor of allowing the president to revoke Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 Venezuelans, putting them at risk for deportation — despite an earlier ruling by a federal judge who found Trump had acted illegally when he moved to revoke TPS.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2199006633.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:57.607782

Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.

He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B program threatens the country’s economic and national security.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.","A coalition of unions, employers and religious groups filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to block President Donald Trump’s bid to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.

Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organizations. They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa program.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.

Supporters and Critics of H-1B Visas

Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programs say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.

Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.

Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.

Trump in his unprecedented order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.

He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B program have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology. He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B program threatens the country’s economic and national security.

Plaintiffs Argue Trump Overstepped Authority

The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa program and cannot under the U.S. Constitution unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.

“The Proclamation transforms the H-1B program into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.

The groups argue that agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. State Department likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”

H-1B Program Scope and Global Impact

The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees. The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.

Pope Francis’s openness to the LGBTQ community, advocacy for migrants and critiques of unrestrained capitalism saw him run up against strong conservative opposition inside and outside the church.

Leo, after gently dipping his toe into the US political fray, is now facing criticism from similar quarters to Francis. The opposition is coming from conservative Catholics in the US and MAGA supporters, some of whom, after Leo’s election, had hoped he would take the church in a different direction from Pope Francis.

The first American pope was asked on Tuesday about plans by the cardinal in Leo’s home city of Chicago to give an award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership. Cardinal Blase Cupich, an ally and friend of the pope, was planning to give Durbin a “Lifetime Achievement Award for support to immigrants,” but the move faced a backlash given Durbin’s support for abortion rights. Durbin decided to refuse the honor.

Unusually, around 10 US bishops even spoke out publicly against the award. Two of those who did – Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone and Bishop Thomas Paprocki – were both appointed a religious liberty advisory body by US President Donald Trump and had been at odds with decisions made by Francis.

Rather than condemn the award, Leo said it was important to look at Durbin’s “40 years of service in the United States Senate.” The pope then said that it’s “not really pro-life” to oppose abortion and support the death penalty, while also questioning whether it was “pro-life” to support the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States.”

Leo’s comments were immediately criticized. One conservative Catholic described it as “disappointing” and “largely irrelevant”, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh said it was a “terrible answer from Pope Leo” and Jack Posobiec, an influencer who is supportive of Trump, posted on X simply: “Some popes are a blessing. Some popes are a penance.” Joseph Strickland, the outspoken retired bishop of Tyler, Texas, said Leo’s remarks had created “much confusion”.

The day after, however, Leo generated more MAGA opposition when he took part in climate conference where he called for action on protecting the planet and blessed some ice. It all comes during a period when Leo had a private meeting with Reverend James Martin, a leading advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, spoke up against the “pandemic of arms” following the Minnesota school shooting and criticised huge CEO salaries and singling out Elon Musk.

Is the Chicago-born pontiff positioning his papacy as a counterbalance to the Trump administration? Along with his comments about abortion and immigration, he described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s recent speech to generals as “worrying”.

Elise Ann Allen, who recently interviewed Leo for her biography of the pope for her book “Leo XIV: Citizen of the World, Missionary of the XXI Century,” said Leo does not want to be “anti-Trump”.

“He’s open to helping and dialoguing with him. He wants to be an interlocutor,” she told CNN. “His remarks are aimed at Catholics and what he’s saying is there is a ‘consistent life ethic’. Yes, abortion is wrong but being pro-life respects human dignity in all its forms, whether it concerns the death penalty or immigrants. Being from the United States, Leo is aware that the term ‘pro-life’ is often pigeon-holed into abortion.”

For some Catholics abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, while they question Francis’ decision to update church teaching and make the death penalty “inadmissible.”

Francis’ critics hoped that Leo’s distinct style – such as his decision to wear the red mozzetta cape after his election – might signal a course correction.

“Conservative Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis’ reforms would follow him into the tomb, that the universal church would view his papacy the way they did, as a bit of bad weather that had finally and thankfully passed,” Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic commentator, wrote in the National Catholic Reporter.

This week they were disappointed. Leo has shown he will, like Francis, try and avoid the culture wars. He doesn’t want to fuel any polarization. “They are very complex issues, and I don’t know if anyone has all the truth on them,” the Pope pointed out when asked about Durbin’s award. Leo will also speak up, when necessary, particularly on the treatment of immigrants, an issue close to his heart from his time as a bishop in Peru. While Leo’s aim is to be a peacemaker his intervention this week show he’s unafraid to face opposition when drawing lines on where the church stands.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2238069640.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-04 22:57:12.137644

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/portlandnationalguard-AP25277270478928,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:39.850062

Donald Trump had announced on 27 September that he would deploy troops to Portland, “authorizing Full Force, if necessary”, ignoring pleas from local officials and the state’s congressional delegation, who suggested that the president was misinformed or lying about the nature and scale of a single, small protest outside one federal immigration enforcement office.

A coalition of 17 mayors in the state had opposed the deployment. Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, filed a lawsuit on Monday fighting the activation of 200 federalized members of the Oregon national guard.

In the restraining order released on Saturday, US district judge Karin Immergut – nominated by Trump – concurred with Oregon’s assertion that Trump deploying federalized national guard troops to Portland would likely inflame rather than calm protests, just as it did in 2020.

The plaintiffs say the deployment would violate the US constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws.

The stark divide in how the two sides described the situation on the ground in Portland was evident at a Friday court hearing before Immergut.

US Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton said “vicious and cruel radicals” had laid siege to the Portland headquarters of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The decision to send 200 troops – just 5% of the number recently sent to respond to Los Angeles protests – showed restraint, Hamilton said.

Caroline Turco, representing Portland, said that there had been no violence against Ice officers for months and that recent Ice protests were “sedate” in the week before Trump declared the city to be a war zone, sometimes featuring fewer than a dozen protesters.

“The president’s perception of what is happening in Portland is not the reality on the ground,” Turco said. “The president’s perception is that it is world war two out here. The reality is that this is a beautiful city with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.”

For years, Trump has promoted an inaccurate narrative that Portland is a “war-ravaged” city with anarchists engaging in chronic chaos. In late September, the president designated antifa as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is not a centralized organization in the US but closer to an ideology with a loose network of activists.

“Today’s ruling validates what Oregonians already know: justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed,” Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said after the restraining order was granted. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. No fires, no bombs, no fatalities due to civil unrest. The only threat we face is to our democracy – and it is being led by President Donald Trump.”

The ruling by Immergut in Portland is a setback for Trump as he seeks to dispatch the military to cities he describes as lawless over the objections of their Democratic leaders.

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several US cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to US military leaders in Virginia, the president proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.","The Conservatives have pledged to deport 150,00 people a year with a Donald Trump-style immigration crackdown.

Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

“There was no rationale to detain Bibi Harjit Kaur,” Deepak Ahluwalia, Kaur’s attorney, told American Community Media in a Sept. 24 interview. “It’s all part of their effort to fill beds.”

“Her detention was nothing short of barbaric,” said Ahluwalia. “That type of treatment would affect most people. They chose to do this to a 73-year-old woman with disabilities and health issues.”

The elderly woman was initially taken to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Bakersfield and then transferred to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Neither her family nor Ahluwalia was informed of the transfer.

No water, harsh conditions

Kaur was not given water to take her medications, according to Ahluwalia. When she asked for water, she was given a plate of ice instead, which she could not chew because of her dentures. In Lumpkin, Kaur was forced to sleep on the floor in a crowded detention facility; she could not easily get up from the floor, as she had surgery on both knees. The strict vegetarian got only meat-based meals for her first six days in detention. She was handcuffed numerous times during transfers.

The Stewart Detention Center is a private ICE detention center operated by CoreCivic.

Kaur — a seamstress who worked at the Berkeley Sari Palace for more than 20 years — had applied for asylum when she first arrived in the U.S. in 1991 with her two young sons, after the death of her husband. Her asylum claim was based on a credible fear of persecution in India. In the 1990s, thousands of Sikhs arrived in the U.S. on asylum claims, stating that they were under threat from the Indian government and the Punjab police after the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguard.

After Gandhi’s assassination, nearly 3,000 Sikhs were killed within days. Many international civil rights organizations have claimed the “anti-Sikh riots” amounted to a genocide. In 2023, California State Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains introduced AJR2 to recognize the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as genocide. The resolution passed the state Assembly and Senate. It did not need Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature; resolutions do not require the governor’s signature. Rep David Valadao, R-California, last October introduced a similar measure in Congress.

Arrested during ICE check-in

Kaur’s asylum case was denied twice: in the last, by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in 2013. She needed travel documents to return to India after her asylum claim was denied, but had not received the necessary paperwork when she was arrested by ICE on Sept. 8 during a routine check-in at the ICE office in San Francisco. Kaur had made the necessary check-ins every 6 months for the past 12 years. Ahluwalia said she had fully cooperated with immigration authorities throughout the lengthy process after her asylum claim was denied.

Kaur’s family was unable to sponsor her for permanent residency, said Ahluwalia. An undocumented resident’s family cannot apply for sponsorship if the person is in the U.S. Kaur would have had to return to India until she was granted a family-based visa, which she could not do because of a lack of travel documents. Kaur’s family could not sponsor her “from within” — while she was still in the U.S., explained Ahluwalia.

“Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.” Family statement

Her family released a statement last week, which read: “Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.”

“She has never refused to return to India but cannot without documents,” noted the family.

India’s consul general responds

Dr. K. Srikar Reddy, the Consul General of India at San Francisco, told ACoM it is the responsibility of ICE to request travel documents for people they are deporting. No such request had been made in the 12 years since Kaur’s asylum claim had been rejected by the 9th Circuit.

“Once ICE requests travel documents, it usually takes just a couple of days for us to issue them. But Mrs. Kaur had migrated more than 30 years ago, so we had no information about her. We had to connect with Indian authorities, which took some time,” said Reddy.

Asked if Kaur faces persecution when she returns to India, Reddy stated: “She was denied by the highest appeals court. That clearly shows that her fears of persecution were unfounded.”

In a statement released to NBC News, ICE defended its deportation of Kaur, noting that she had lost all of her legal remedies several years ago. “ICE is enforcing U.S. law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more U.S. tax dollars,” read the statement.

As of 2022-23, India was the fifth largest source of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., following Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, according to the Pew Research Center. Reddy said he has seen a slight increase in requests for travel documents over the past seven months.

Pritzker said the guard received word from the Pentagon in the morning that the troops would be called up. He did not specify when or where they would be deployed, but President Donald Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to questions about Pritzker's statement.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Illinois follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to help Memphis police.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail.

Pritzker called Trump's move in Illinois a ""manufactured performance"" that would pull the state's National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs.

""For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,"" said the governor, who also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago.

Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.

City and state officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday, and a ruling is expected over the weekend.

Supreme Court and Lower Court Rulings A landmark 1898 Supreme Court case recognized the US-born children of Chinese immigrants as citizens under the 14th Amendment.","Boston, Oct 4 (AP) Over the past month, four federal courts have ruled against President Donald Trump’s executive order that sought to end automatic citizenship for children born in the US to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. On Friday, another federal court delivered a similar verdict.

A unanimous panel of the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston determined that President Trump cannot enforce the order. This decision aligns with four previous court rulings nationwide that have blocked the executive order.

The US Supreme Court is expected to have the final decision on birthright citizenship, as the Trump administration has already asked the High court for review.

Federal judges have repeatedly noted that the executive order conflicts with both Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution itself. Although the Supreme Court is not bound by the opinions of lower courts or even its own prior decisions, the repeated lower court losses could signal a challenging battle ahead for the administration—even before a Court that has often supported Trump’s policy actions.

The Right to Birthright Citizenship

Birthright citizenship has long been rooted in US law, widely acknowledged as granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868 to guarantee citizenship rights to Black Americans, including former slaves. The amendment’s citizenship clause states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are American citizens.

Lawyers for the administration have maintained that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” language means that citizenship is not automatically extended to children born in the US unless the children have primary allegiance to the US. Accordingly, they argue, children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visitors, whose allegiance is presumed to lie elsewhere, should not receive automatic citizenship.

Advt

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson stated on Friday that the 1st Circuit’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment is flawed.

However, legal experts point to the amendment’s legislative history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings to refute the administration’s reading. Congressional debate at the time of its adoption shows lawmakers intended a broad birthright citizenship guarantee that included children of immigrants, with the “subject to the jurisdiction” phrase simply meaning subject to US law.

Historically, two groups—children of Native Americans on tribal lands and children of foreign diplomats—were the only exceptions contemplated by the clause.

Supreme Court and Lower Court Rulings

A landmark 1898 Supreme Court case recognized the US-born children of Chinese immigrants as citizens under the 14th Amendment. While the Supreme Court has never squarely ruled on the citizenship rights of children born to undocumented immigrants, a footnote in a 1982 case suggests no distinction between such children and those born to parents in the country legally.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority considered a challenge to the birthright citizenship order, but declined to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it used the opportunity to limit lower courts’ power to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policy—an outcome favorable to the administration.

Numerous lower courts, starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, have blocked the order. The Supreme Court’s June ruling left open the possibility for nationwide orders in class-action and state-led lawsuits.

In recent decisions, judges certified a class of all children born in the US after the order’s effective date who could be denied citizenship. Others found that differing state responses to the order would not relieve its burden, as people frequently move between states and could give birth outside their state of residence.

Since citizenship status determines eligibility for certain government benefits, the affected states would need to overhaul their eligibility systems, according to the decisions by the 9th Circuit and a federal judge in Boston.

The 1st Circuit panel described the issue in clear terms, noting that birthright citizenship is firmly established and questioning the legitimacy of recent efforts to challenge it.

White House Response

White House spokesperson Jackson indicated that the administration remains confident it will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court.

To implement the executive order, officials would require confirmation of parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers or passports, according to recent guidance. AP

A federal judge has granted Oregon's temporary restraining order on the National Guard deployment early Saturday evening.

People gathered around noon at Elizabeth Caruthers Park on South Moody Avenue. The group, which grew to several hundred people, then marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Photos taken of the protesters show some of them holding signs and flowers, and others dressed up in costumes, including one person in a Handmaid's Tale costume.

At one point, a KGW crew saw federal agents use several rounds of some kind of chemical crowd control munitions — such as tear gas, mace and pepper balls — sprayed on protesters outside the ICE facility.

Holly Brown, who helped organize Saturday's protest and said that she's been protesting at the facility over the past months, stepped over the blue line on the ground marking federal property. She, along with two other people, was seemingly detained by federal agents.

Moments later, agents deployed tear gas and mace. KGW also photographed a person who said that they were hit with a pepper ball.

Much of the crowd dispersed in the immediate aftermath. KGW did not witness any violence coming from the side of the protesters.

In a news release, organizers with PDXCD accused Trump of militarizing the city, and also noted the city of Portland issued a land use violation against the ICE facility.

""I think a lot of people are very scared. A lot of people are very nervous. Sending the military after your own citizens is an egregious act,"" said Holly Brown. She said she's also been protesting at the ICE facility over the past few months.

""The people protesting at ICE are completely peaceful,"" Brown added. ""They are people who are going out there to stand up for their immigrant neighbors, and they are being painted in some press outlets and by Donald Trump as agitators, as people who don't belong here who are causing violence, and nothing could be further from the truth.""

FBI data released Thursday claims that they have made 128 arrests since June 9, but KGW has found that many taken into custody are not formally charged; those who have been charged are facing penalties, from trespassing to assaulting a federal officer.
