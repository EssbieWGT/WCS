Maine executive director Crystal Cron said at a news conference Thursday, according to a copy of her remarks provided by the group.
Dozens of incidents in Maine have come to light only because they involved local law enforcement agencies.
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, which offers legal help and advocacy to immigrants in Maine, says it has been trying to keep up with arrests involving local law enforcement officers.
ILAP is aware of 22 incidents in Maine involving state and local police in which more than 50 people have been taken by immigration officials.","Several advocacy groups who have opposed increased immigration enforcement in Maine say they’re launching a hotline to track activity by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers throughout the state.

The Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and other community partners say they have struggled to respond as more and more people are reporting ICE and Border Patrol sightings, many of which they say are hard to verify and create fear in immigrant communities.

During a news conference last week, advocates said they hope the hotline will create an accurate accounting of where immigration officials are working and what they’re doing in Maine “during a time of heightened enforcement and targeting of immigrants and refugees.”

“Agents are showing up at people’s homes without warrants, targeting day laborers, and using surveillance to track and intimidate our communities,” Presente! Maine executive director Crystal Cron said at a news conference Thursday, according to a copy of her remarks provided by the group. “This isn’t about public safety — it’s about control and fear.”

The coalition also launched a resource hub online with information on legal services and relief funds for families whose breadwinners were arrested by ICE.

Anna Welch, director of the Refugee and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Maine School of Law, said she hopes the hotline will combat the fear and confusion that immigrants in the state are experiencing. Welch said the clinic has held more than 300 legal consultations with ICE detainees in Maine jails and that clients often have questions about their basic rights and what will happen to their families.

“There’s just so much confusion, there’s just so much misinformation,” Welch said Monday.

Aside from news reports and rumors, such arrests have been a struggle to track. Dozens of incidents in Maine have come to light only because they involved local law enforcement agencies.

Family and loved ones of those arrested by ICE have also had a hard time finding people during the government shutdown, according to reporting from the Boston Globe.

U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, said her office has been trying to help some of these families for months and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection — whose agents carry out many immigration arrests in Maine — has refused to create its own locator service to report where it is holding people in its custody, unlike ICE.

“In the wake of the Administration’s sweeping edict to dramatically ramp up enforcement and detainment operations, some of these tools — including ICE’s own detainee locator system — have become unreliable,” Pingree said in a written statement Monday.

At the news conference, Cron said the organizations involved in the hotline hope it will help inform immigrant families who are trying to locate their loved ones after they’ve been detained or who worry they might be arrested.

The groups said they have more than 100 trained volunteers who will take calls from people who believe they’ve seen ICE or Border Patrol, and who will then confirm whether the reports are true.

A spokesperson for the ICE field office serving Maine referred a reporter to previous statements that the Department of Homeland Security’s leaders have made regarding hotlines in other states, some of which Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested “looks like obstruction of justice.”

Noem was not commenting specifically on the Maine program. Volunteers are only expected to document what they see, the groups said, not to intervene.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, which offers legal help and advocacy to immigrants in Maine, says it has been trying to keep up with arrests involving local law enforcement officers.

Spokesperson and attorney Lisa Parisio said ILAP is not involved in the hotline, nor could she comment yet on what impact it might have.

But Parisio said ILAP can also attest to the lack of information. Not only is there no centralized tracking system for ICE arrests, Parisio said, but fear among immigrants and ICE’s practice of arresting people and sending them out of state has also made getting information harder.

ILAP is aware of 22 incidents in Maine involving state and local police in which more than 50 people have been taken by immigration officials. Parisio said ILAP has received but not been able to verify several other reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” Parisio said.",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/ICE-Impersonator_66272.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-10-27 19:01:16.642034

The result has been mounting frustration for congressional Democrats, who had already been suing the Trump administration for curtailing or limiting access to detention facilities prior to the shutdown. They said even when the requirement was on the books, ICE had thrown up roadblocks to their visits.

“Members and staff were informed that the denials were due to the ongoing government shutdown and a lack of available funding or personnel to facilitate the visits,” said an aide to one congressional office affected by the policy change, requesting anonymity due to the ongoing litigation.

Now, their emails requesting visits are either being denied or met with auto-replies.

“Due to the current hiatus in federal funding, ICE Office of Congressional Relations staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or perform other work-related duties. Once funding is restored, normal operations will resume,” read one recent auto-reply to a lawmaker’s office, reviewed by POLITICO.

Cobb is weighing whether to pause the ongoing lawsuit until the shutdown ends.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, acknowledged the shutdown’s impact on lawmaker visits and said the lawmakers themselves were to blame.

“While the Democrats may not care about shutting down the government and making millions of public servants go without a paycheck, maybe they will get back to work now that they have lost the precious appropriations rider they rely on to try to storm ICE facilities,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

McLaughlin’s comment appears to reference the scrum that broke out when Rep. LaMonica McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers visited a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, earlier this year. Federal prosecutors charged McIver with assaulting a security official after she and others intervened to prevent the arrest of Newark’s Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka. McIver has pleaded not guilty and has accused the Trump administration of “political intimidation.”

The Trump administration has attempted to punish Democrats during the shutdown by pinning the fallout on the left while ensuring the president’s own priorities continue uninterrupted. Offices tasked with immigration enforcement have retained significantly more staff than in prior shutdowns, and immigration enforcement operations have continued without interruption — further buffered by mandatory funding included in the One Big Beautiful Bill.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F39%2F23%2F4735639c4b99a0084fdb75cec9af%2Fimmigration-protests-new-jersey-42689.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:00:51.686587

More broadly, Bonta told reporters that the Trump administration appears to be ready to fight the Nov. 4 results if Prop.
Baldassarre also declined to say how many election monitors would work in California.","Atty. General Rob Bonta said Monday that he anticipates the Trump administration, which last week announced plans to use federal election monitors in California, will use false reports of voting irregularities to challenge the results of the Nov. 4 special election.

Bonta, California’s top law enforcement officer, said on a call with reporters that he is “100%” concerned about false accusations of wrongdoing at the polling places.

Bonta said it would be “naive” to assume Trump would accept the results of the Nov. 4 election given his history of lying about election outcomes, including his loss to President Biden in 2020.

The attorney general also warned that Trump’s tactics may be a preview of what the country might see in the 2026 election, when control of the U.S. House of Representatives — and the fate of Trump’s controversial political agenda — will be at stake.

“All indications, all arrows, show that this is a tee-up for something more dangerous in the 2026, midterms and maybe beyond,” Bonta said.

The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced it would send election monitors to five California counties where voters are casting ballots in the Proposition 50 election to decide whether to redraw state’s congressional boundaries.

Federal election monitors will visit sites across Southern California and in the Central Valley, in Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, the Justice Department said last week.

Gov. Gavin Newsom called the move an “intimidation tactic” aimed at suppressing support for Proposition 50 and inappropriate federal interference in a state election.

While federal monitoring is routine, particularly in federal elections, it recently has been viewed with heightened skepticism from both parties. When the Justice Department under President Biden announced monitoring in 86 jurisdictions across 27 states during last November’s presidential election, some Republican-led states balked and sought to block the effort.

Democrats have been highly suspect of the Trump administration’s plans for monitoring elections, in part because of Trump’s relentless denial of past election losses — including his own to Biden in 2020 — and his appointment of fellow election deniers to high-ranking positions in his administration, including in the Justice Department.

The California Republican Party requested the election monitors and cited several concerns about voting patterns and issues in several counties, according to a letter it sent to the Dept. of Justice.

Bonta, in his remarks Monday questioned the GOP claims, and denied the existence of any widespread fraud that would require federal election monitors. He compared the monitors to Trump’s decision to dispatch the National Guard to Democratic-led cities, despite an outcry from local politicians who said the troops were not necessary.

More broadly, Bonta told reporters that the Trump administration appears to be ready to fight the Nov. 4 results if Prop. 50 passes.

“People vote and you accept the will of the voters -- that’s what democracy is. But that’s not what they’re teeing themselves up to do based on everything that we’ve seen, everything that’s been said,” said Bonta, describing Trump’s recent call on social media for Republicans to “wake up.”

Bonta also said that the state would dispatch observers — potentially from his office, the secretary of state and county registrars — to watch the federal monitors at polling places.

Early voting has already started in California, with voters deciding whether to temporarily reconfigure the state’s congressional district boundaries. The Democratic-led California Legislature placed the measure on the Nov. 4 ballot in an effort to increase their party’s numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives .

Gov. Gavin Newsom and other backers of the measure have said they generally support independent redistricting processes and will push for nonpartisan commissions nationwide, but argued that Democrats must fight back against Trump’s current efforts to have Republican states reconfigure their congressional districts to ensure the GOP retains control of Congress after the 2026 election.

Shackled and chained while miscarrying, denied prenatal care, given inadequate food and water—these are the conditions that pregnant women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention must endure.

Despite its own directive advising against detaining pregnant individuals, ICE has increasingly held pregnant immigrants in facilities across the country, where abuse and medical neglect go unchecked. Over the past nine months, the ACLU and partner immigrant rights groups, including the National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South, and SNAP, interviewed more than a dozen pregnant women who described horrific treatment at ICE facilities. We found widespread neglect and repeated violations of federal policy.

“Immigration detention is known for medical neglect, abusive conditions, and utter disregard for the dignity of people in ICE’s custody,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, who co-authored a letter to ICE documenting these conditions. “Still, what we heard from the pregnant women we interviewed are some of the most horrifying stories I’ve heard about detention.”

Although ICE has stopped publicly reporting the number of pregnant individuals it detains, and has refused to provide this information to Congress, ICE acknowledged that Basile, a detention center in south Louisiana, was holding 14 pregnant women as of April 2025. That number reflects a broader trend of detaining people who should qualify for release under federal regulations, which require the release of women “medically certified as pregnant.”

Interviews with detained women reveal that ICE officers have arrested pregnant individuals even after they informed staff of their pregnancies, including survivors of domestic violence, who are at heightened risk.

In April 2025, Alicia* arrived for her routine ICE check-in in Louisiana and was detained without warning, sent to Basile. She soon discovered she was pregnant. She was taken to a local hospital for a blood test, but no one explained her medical treatment or provided interpretation. In detention, she received small portions of poor-quality food that left her feeling weak and hungry. By May, Alicia began experiencing severe abdominal pain, cramping, and bleeding. She reported her symptoms to facility staff, who transported her to an emergency room, where medical personnel performed an invasive uterine test without her consent, injected her with an unknown medication, and later informed her that she had miscarried.

Despite this miscarriage, ICE returned her to Basile that night and detained her for two more months. She continued to experience heavy bleeding, swelling, fever, and severe uterine pain, submitting repeated sick call requests that went unanswered. In July 2025, ICE deported Alicia, separating her from her children, and she later sought hospital care for a severe infection acquired while in custody.

Alicia’s experience is far from unique. Marie,* a graduate student and lawful visitor to the United States, was detained for more than 20 weeks at Basile during her high-risk pregnancy. Although she had informed ICE officers that she was pregnant, officers placed in solitary confinement after transferring her thousands of miles from the U.S-Canada border to Basile. She was not sent for medical treatment until other detained women advocated for her. Inside the facility, Marie said the food was often inedible and when she asked about missing prenatal vitamins, a nurse told her, “You won’t die if you don’t take them.”

Marie was released only after legal advocates intervened, but after her detention she developed eclampsia, endured a difficult delivery, and continues to struggle with postpartum depression linked to her detention trauma.

Other women’s stories mirror these experiences. Lucia,* who was detained after appearing for a regular check-in appointment with ICE, began to experience heavy vaginal bleeding in the middle of the night when she was two months pregnant. She requested immediate medical attention, but was not taken to see medical staff for several hours. Instead, medical staff took her to a small room and left her bleeding alone without providing her any food, water, or pain medication. Later that evening, after a significant loss of blood, she was taken to the emergency room, with her arms and legs shackled as she was actively miscarrying. When she arrived at the hospital, she required a blood transfusion because she had suffered a miscarriage.

Julieta,* detained for two months despite having a valid visa, was shackled at the ankles, hands, and waist during cross-country transport and feared that poor nutrition and stress could endanger her pregnancy. Ana,* six months pregnant and still in detention, was denied prenatal vitamins and meaningful medical care. Jenny,* visibly pregnant when detained in February 2025, was restrained during transport, suffered vomiting, diarrhea, and vaginal bleeding, and had limited access to drinking water.

Together, these accounts depict a systemic pattern of cruelty and medical neglect toward pregnant women in ICE custody, in direct violation of agency prohibitions on detaining and restraining pregnant individuals.

“The stories that are represented in this letter are just the tip of the iceberg,” Cho told NBC News earlier this month. “You have women who are talking about being shackled and restrained while they’re actively miscarrying; you have women begging and pleading for things as basic as prenatal vitamins and being denied.”

The ACLU and partners are calling on ICE to act immediately to address this systemic abuse. In a letter to Congress, advocates urged the agency to identify and release all pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals and to follow its own directives prohibiting detention except in rare circumstances. They also recommended establishing a clear process for pregnant detainees to request timely release, ensuring access to medical care that meets community standards, investigating neglect and abuse at Basile, and closing facilities that have repeatedly violated detention standards designed to protect pregnant and postpartum individuals.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/10/shame-on-ice-s.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:01:02.045813

Hamdi was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yesterday, Oct. 26, in an apparent response to his criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and at the urging of anti-Muslim, pro-Israel extremists.

Hamdi was detained by immigration officials at the San Francisco International Airport while on a speaking tour in the U.S., which he has done many times in the past. The night prior to his detention, he spoke at CAIR Sacramento’s annual gala and was traveling to speak at CAIR Florida’s gala.

Notorious anti-Muslim extremist Laura Loomer has publicly taken credit for his abduction, claiming that ICE acted in response to her demands and smearing Hamdi with various anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“This past Saturday, I had the privilege to join Sami Hamdi at CAIR Sacramento’s annual gala, where he, as always, spoke with moral clarity and courage. I was shocked to be contacted by him early Sunday morning to inform me that he was being detained by immigration officials, and that his visa was being revoked—seemingly for no reason other than pressure from extremist, anti-Muslim, and pro-Israel voices seeking to silence him.

“Sami has been a strong and outspoken voice against Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and the dehumanization of the Palestinian people. It is clear that his unjust detention is nothing less than an attempt to undermine our Constitution and punish journalists for speaking the truth in order to shield Israel from accountability for its laundry list of war crimes and human rights violations.

“Our legal team is working towards his immediate release and aiming to hold ICE accountable for bowing to the whims of Islamophobes and supporters of the Israeli government.”

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.
In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.
As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.","GREENBELT, Md. (CN) — The Justice Department walked back a plan to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Liberia as soon as Oct. 31 at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis Monday, after a reminder that such a removal would violate her court order blocking the Maryland man’s removal.

Xinis scheduled Monday’s hearing to address the government’s notice filed late Friday night stating it had selected Liberia as the fourth African country it would try to deport Ábrego García to after he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March.

“Federal defendants have received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for petitioner’s arrival,” the Justice Department said in the Friday filing. “Defendants expect to be able to effectuate removal as soon as Oct. 31.”

The Barack Obama appointed judge appeared perplexed by the designation, as Ábrego García has repeatedly listed Costa Rica as a destination he would not challenge as he does not have the same fear of persecution that he’s stated regarding El Salvador and the Justice Department’s three prior African destinations.

Further, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee, the Obama appointee presiding over Ábrego García’s criminal case brought after he was returned from El Salvador in June, has scheduled an evidentiary hearing Nov. 4.

The evidentiary hearing, Xinis noted, is meant to address pretrial motions in preparation for a looming January trial over Ábrego García’s immigration-related human trafficking charges.

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign acknowledged that removing Ábrego García to Liberia on Oct. 31 would violate Xinis’ injunction barring his removal from the continental United States and stated the government would continue to abide by it.

Justice Department officials previously listed Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana as potential destinations, based on apparent assurances from the nations that any immigrant sent there would not be subject to persecution while there and will not be handed over to their home country if they have a reasonable fear of persecution there.

Ghana’s foreign minister Sam Okudzeto Ablawka rejected the idea that Ábrego García could be deported there, stating on Oct. 10 that the nation made clear to the U.S. government that Ghana would only accept West African migrants, “purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles.”

Liberia announced Saturday that it would accept Ábrego García “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis, following a formal request from the government of the United States,” its government said in a statement.

In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.

“Simply put, the statute creates an order of operations that allows the government to lawfully remove petitioner only to Costa Rica,” Cooper said. “If it is not removing him there, then it cannot lawfully remove him at all.”

Cooper said he and his colleagues have not received any indications or evidence from the government that it has made any effort to effectuate removal to Costa Rica, the only thing it had provided was Friday’s notice of Liberia’s designation.

“This confirms that another country designation does not demonstrate good faith efforts to effectuate removal or any realistic prospect thereof,” Cooper wrote.

As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.

Xinis quickly instructed Ensign to send word to USCIS that the interview cannot occur while Ábrego García’s attorneys were tied up in the proceeding, and to either delay the interview or the hearing.

She called the questionable timing “completely unacceptable” and “not fair play,” expressing frustration with the Justice Department and a lack of faith that the interview would be moved without a clear confirmation from Ensign.

Xinis ordered the parties to file a joint status update to determine further proceedings in the case, noting that she has yet to address Ábrego García’s claims that his due process rights have been violated throughout his ordeal.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/ap-kilmar-abrego-garcia-oct-10.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-27 18:01:06.141198

Multiple attendees called for Thursday’s meeting to be the first step in a campaign to block the possible immigration detention center.
We’ve got to come back next month.” Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center.","On a quiet patch of land surrounded by miles of cotton fields, and not far from the blinking lights of Marana’s regional airport, the turn-off to a vacant prison building is marked by an empty frame of a sign and a dead cactus, reduced to its ribs but still reaching to the sky. Outside the facility itself, cracked asphalt leads to low-lying gray buildings, some topped with barbed wire. The basketball court stands empty and lit.

The facility could soon be the site of an immigration detention center after private prison operator Management and Training Corp. (MTC) bought it from the state this summer, despite what appears to be growing community opposition and no opportunity for a vote from local officials.

A packed community forum turned impromptu organizing meeting, held Oct. 23, offered a first look for many into the reality of the detention center, what community members want to know about the project moving ahead, and how some of them may try to stop it.

MTC did not respond to a request for comment.

The meeting was convened by District 3 Supervisor Jen Allen, with panelists from the ACLU of Arizona, Just Communities Arizona and the Florence Project. Attendees took green question cards, discussed with others at their table, and formed a line to ask the panelists questions. They held Abolish ICE and Defund ICE posters, and often jeered or booed at the mere mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, moving into town.

Allen noted the potential “ripple effects” of opening a detention center, including the fear of local community members. “It affects our families, it affects our neighbors, our schools. It affects businesses. It affects every facet of our community,” said Allen. “Getting engaged now is the right time to be doing it.”

As Trump’s immigration crackdown continues to surge in many parts of the country, recent data point to an unprecedented number of people locked up in immigration detention centers. As of Sept. 21, about 60,000 people were detained, according to a data research center at Syracuse University. A 2022 study showed that “immigrants in counties with more detention space are significantly more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE.” That fear seems to have been one of the main reasons so many people turned out against the possible facility in Marana.

Among the 300-plus people who showed up Thursday night was Marana resident Evy McDonald.

She told Arizona Luminaria she wasn’t sure what to expect from the forum. But when she walked in to see those hundreds of people, “I felt like I walked into a sea of hope,” she said.

McDonald said she’s been an activist and protester for a half a century, and that the younger generations taking up social justice now have a lot to learn from their elders. “We were the young adults who burned draft cards, who burned bras,” she said. “If the center opens, there’s a lot we can still do to disrupt things. You have to be willing to put your privilege and your life on the line.”

She was one of many people that night who were making a call to action.

Here’s what people asked at the forum, and the key points of information to catch up on the status of a possible immigration detention center in southern Arizona.

How did we get here?

A key question attendees asked was how we got here, and who approved a plan to turn the shuttered prison into an immigration detention facility.

This summer, Congress approved $45 billion for new detention centers, part of an increase in spending for immigration enforcement that experts say would significantly grow America’s immigration enforcement apparatus. That would be a 256% annual budget increase to ICE’s current detention budget, according to the American Immigration Council.

MTC runs five immigration detention centers across the country, and one in Australia; the Marana facility would be the sixth in the U.S.

The Arizona Department of Administration, a state agency that acts as the administrative hub for state government, sold the building back to MTC in July for $15 million. MTC had previously operated a minimum security prison in the building until 2023, when the state ended the contract because the facility was operating at less than half capacity, according to a news release from Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office.

“MTC operates the Arizona State Prison — Marana, a minimum security prison with capacity for 500 male inmates. Over the last several years however, the facility has averaged an inmate population of 225,” the release said. “Despite the reduced population, ADCRR is required by contract to pay for nearly 475 beds. By ending the contract, the State will save an estimated $5 million in FY24, and nearly $10 million in FY25.”

The capacity of the Marana detention center is 500 people. In 2017, when the population of the private prison was near capacity at 487, the prison employed 119 people, according to a state audit of the facility.

As the state owned the facility, and it was already zoned for a prison, there was no local approval required for the sale to move ahead, said speakers on Thursday.

“I just want to point out that the state of Arizona did sell this to MTC. They didn’t have to,” said Noah Schramm, the Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy Strategist at the ACLU of Arizona.

When the facility may open is uncertain. Liz Casey, of the Florence Project, said she’s been looking for job postings online as one way to see if they’re hoping to begin operations soon.

In an August statement to Arizona Luminaria, the Town of Marana said it had not been involved in the procurement process, and therefore did not track local reactions or concerns.

“As a municipality, we have always been in favor of a facility use that would generate local employment and create opportunities for collaboration on essential public services, such as road and street cleaning that could be performed by inmates,” the statement said.

Only one member of the Marana town council, Patrick Cavanaugh, attended Thursday’s meeting. He said it was frustrating to watch a detention center moving ahead without any clear levers to step in. “We’re not paying their bills, so there’s really nothing we can do,” he said. “In everything we’re seeing across this country, they’re not giving any due process. These are our neighbors, you know? That’s the problem here.”

What is the experience of people detained in private prisons, or other MTC facilities?

Conditions in immigration detention are stark, punishing and sometimes deadly, said Thursday’s panel.

Casey, a social worker with the Florence Project who helps document conditions in Arizona detention centers said that water and power outages, issues with access to hygiene, and medical neglect are common in immigration detention centers. Two people have died in Arizona immigration detention this year — one in Eloy and one in Florence.

Schramm, of the ACLU, echoed the critiques. “ICE detention centers across the country have consistently been places where people’s most basic and fundamental rights and dignity are violated,” he said.

“It is worth remembering that the people who are detained in these places often have not had a judge consider their case, have not had their day in court, have not been convicted of a crime,” Schramm said. “This is civil detention. It’s not supposed to be punitive, and yet, for years, we have heard so many stories of physical and verbal abuse by detention staff, of people being subjected to solitary confinement for the most minor infractions.”

Isaacson said that the push to cut costs was especially strong for private prison providers who made a profit by using less money than they were paid to run the facility.

“They’re competing for contracts with the government. That’s a competitive process,” she said. “They’ve got to come in as the lowest bidder, and then they’re going to make a profit on top of that. How do they do that? They do that by cutting corners.”

Watchdog groups have raised concerns about conditions at most of MTC’s immigration detention facilities

The MTC-owned and operated Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California did not have a nebulizer to help a detained person who eventually died of bronchopneumonia; at the time, the company had a policy to reorder medical supplies every two months regardless of whether they ran out earlier, according to a 2018 Human Rights Watch report.

At Otero County Processing Center a report from immigrant rights group Freedom for Immigrants found over 200 complaints of abuse between 2015 and 2018 that included inadequate food and medical attention, limited access to hygiene supplies and harassment by guards.

A lack of access to clean water, medication, along with freezing temperatures and lack of access to legal services were identified by Amnesty International from an April 2025 visit to the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas.

The El Valle Detention Facility in Texas was formerly the Willacy Detention Center, where advocates identified poor medical care, sexual abuse and overuse of solitary confinement.

IAH in Texas has had at least one detained person die following their detention; the ACLU of Texas has called for the facility to be shut down due to inadequate medical care and extensive use of solitary confinement.

A member of the audience also spoke about their decade of experience as a former correctional officer. Detainees faced abuse and violence, but so did staff, she said. “It is not good for anyone.”

Have immigration detention centers been stopped before?

While detention centers have been opened around the country, community organizers have stopped or slowed down efforts to open new facilities.

In Leavenworth, Kansas, a conservative community in an area full of federal and state prisons, some local officials and residents have used the permitting process as a public way to register their concern about a detention center in the area. Most recently, city leaders filed two lawsuits against CoreCivic, the company proposing to run the facility.

In 2011 in Florida’s Southwest Ranches, CoreCivic (formerly CCA) wanted to build a detention facility with a capacity of 1,500 people. But as residents in the neighboring town of Pembroke Pines were worried about dipping property values and were generally against the project, the city of Pembroke decided to cancel a contract supplying sewage, water, and fire-rescue services to Southwest Ranches. That was enough of a headache to scare away CoreCivic, which pulled out of plans to build in Southwest Ranches.

SouthWest Ranches sued Pembroke for damages — lost revenue. After a decade-long fight, they lost in court, and Southwest Ranches was billed with $2 million in legal fees.

Allen also said that localities have considered revoking permits or opening up a conversation about zoning again. She also suggested talking to the farmers around the heavily agricultural surrounding area about how this would impact them.

How will a new immigration detention center impact enforcement in communities?

Another Marana resident, Clement DeLarge, asked at the forum: “Is ICE going to be hanging out at churches and schools and things like that?”

Cities across the country have seen an uptick in immigration enforcement with the Trump administration’s mandate to increase deportation numbers.

In some communities, including most recently an aggressive blitz in Chicago, that has meant hostile stops by masked agents that leave people out of communication for days. More than 170 U.S. citizens have been held by immigration agents in recent months, ProPublica found.

Having an immigration detention facility in the region with capacity for at least 500 people would almost certainly lead to increased enforcement in Southern Arizona, the panelists said.

Detention center contracts sometimes include a minimum number of people that have to be detained, said Casey. “They will fill it,” she said. “If that means filling it with people from the neighborhood, that potentially could happen.”

Mo Goldman, an immigration attorney who has practiced law in Arizona since 2000, said he had witnessed “so much pain and hardship” in detention centers. He also reminded the crowd that the funding for the Marana private detention center would be provided by public dollars. “It’s not money that just comes out of nowhere,” he said.

Isaacson also noted that immigration detention centers, even as companies promised jobs, actually depressed property values and drained resources like water and electricity. “When is the last time y’all went shopping in Florence? Anybody looking at houses in Eloy on Zillow?” she asked. “You’re popping down a small city in the middle of your city, and again, you’re paying for that.”

The panelists also warned about the detention-related safeguards that have been eroded since the Trump administration took office, which will make it more difficult to fight against abuses. The administration shuttered the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, as well as the independent ombudsman office that monitored immigration detention..

Casey said that wrongful death lawsuits were one tool that remained, along with efforts by elected officials to attempt to get access to detention facilities as one means of oversight, even if those visits were no longer possible to conduct unannounced. Rep. Yassamin Ansari recently visited a detention center in Eloy to draw attention to what she says are abusive conditions faced by immigrants.

What’s next?

Multiple attendees called for Thursday’s meeting to be the first step in a campaign to block the possible immigration detention center.

Jeanne Lukasko said they wanted to see everyone in the same place next month to continue working together. “I’m seeing the energy here tonight. We’ve got to keep it going. We’ve got to come back next month.”

Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center. “As a private sale right now. I think the best thing, the most powerful thing, is to build clear public opposition,” he said. “Make it clear not only to MTC, but also to your local elected representatives, representatives in the House and the Senate, that this is intolerable, that this is a priority issue, that this is something that you will not stop bothering them about.”

William Joseph, a Marana resident, told Arizona Luminaria that he was “totally opposed” to the detention center. “I don’t trust ICE at all. They’re snatching people left and right.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June.

During a status conference on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned why the government does not simply deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica — a country he has said he is willing to go to because the government has promised he would welcomed as a legal immigrant and not re-deported to El Salvador.

“Any insight you can shed on why we're continuing this hearing when you could deport him to a third country tomorrow?” Xinis asked government attorneys. She noted that both the government and Abrego Garcia were “about to burn significant resources” in fighting over whether he can legally be deported to Liberia.

However, they are not satisfied by what they have received. He hinted that the Liberian government has only agreed to take Abrego Garcia for a limited time.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, who have argued that they violate due process rights and that immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Chicago has impacted people across the city and the surrounding suburbs.

Recently, federal agents tear-gassed a residential street on the North Side on Oct. 24, after detaining people in the predominantly White neighborhoods of Lake View and Lincoln Park, according to Block Club Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested more than 1,500 people as of the beginning of October, though USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify their count.

Some immigration advocates call the arrests ""abductions."" Federal agents and agencies face lawsuits, including from a Chicago City Council member following her brief detainment at a hospital, and an ongoing case over accusations that agents have violated limits on how ICE can make arrests without warrants and during traffic stops.

Whether a U.S. citizen or not, here is what you should know about encountering a federal immigration officer:

If immigration officers approach or engage in public

Chicago's Office of Immigration, Migrant and Refugee Rights released a guide titled ""Know Your Rights & Resources: Upholding Justice and Rights for Every Chicagoan.""

A section by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights offers the following about rights when engaging with immigration agents in any location:

You have the right to remain silent.

You do not have to disclose your immigration status.

You do not have to sign anything you don't understand.

You can ask to speak with an attorney.

It also advises that people should remain calm and keep hands in sight.

If immigration officers come to your home

ICE agents do not have the legal right to enter your home without a warrant signed by a judge, according to ICIRR, which also explains that some ICE warrants are signed by other officers within the agency and do not give the same legal authority as those signed by a judge.

The National Immigrant Justice Center has sample images to spot the difference between the two kinds of warrants on its website.

Are you allowed to film immigration interactions?

Legal precedent indicates yes, filming a law enforcement officer conducting their official business in public is covered by the First Amendment. A column published by the Cato Institute said the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on it explicitly, but it has been upheld by seven federal circuits.

However, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in July, according to CBS12, that videotaping agents and posting it online could be considered ""doxing"" and therefore violence against officers.

The National Immigrant Justice Center says, if filming or taking notes of what's happening, take care not to interfere or obstruct the operation.

ICIRR also has a hotline for witnessing ICE activity: 855-HELP-MY-FAMILY (855-435-7693).

“You know how I feel, I was very much opposed,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Japan.

“You can’t expect them to make unbelievably complex chips and computers and other things and pick people off the unemployment line that haven’t worked in five years.”

The president said factories that churn out “very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment” – like Hyundai’s new EV battery plant in Ellabell, Ga. – need to bring in specialized workers.

While such foreign laborers should focus on teaching their American counterparts, it’s a process that takes time, Trump added.

ICE officials rounded up 475 workers at the Hyundai plant on Sept. 4 in the largest single-site operation in the department’s history.

Video footage released by authorities showed some workers being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and wrists – putting strain on the US’ relationship with South Korea.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz said the battery plant – one of the largest economic development projects in the state’s history – will face a two- to three-month startup delay because of the raid.

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown.

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president’s spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful, could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court’s conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration’s push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

WATCH: A look at Russell Vought’s influence and his push to reshape the government

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It’s hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That’s equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding, primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

“The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,” said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. “That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country’s massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

“If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender, race, immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers by usurping Congress’ authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People’s Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court’s conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department, freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health.

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions.

That’s when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

The panel made its recommendation just days after President Donald Trump backed down from his earlier plans to send federal immigration agents to the city.

Jessy Ruiz Navarro was one of two people to apply to the commission, on which she is already serving, for a term ending June 6, 2026. Gay Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman said it’s important she continue serving at “a time trans folks and people from Latin America in particular are experiencing extreme hate and oppression in this country … from the federal government.”

Mandelman moved to forward Navarro’s nomination to the full board as a committee report Monday, with Rules Committee colleagues Supervisors Matt Dorsey, a gay man who represents District 6, and Stephen Sherrill, who represents District 2, voting yes. Dorsey was filling in for District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton, who was excused.

The full board is expected to vote on the matter Tuesday.

Navarro, who has been living in San Francisco since 2017, has been serving on the commission since 2019. She is one of a handful of trans city commissioners.

“For me, remaining in this position is not only important but necessary, in particular representing the immigrant community and my trans community,” Navarro said, speaking in Spanish that was translated by an interpreter. “In the current political context, our voices, those of trans women, are often unheard or ignored. It is therefore essential we continue to fight for fair policies and representation.""

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made it a point to sign executive orders attempting to delegitimize the transgender community. The Biden administration had interpreted federal civil rights statutes referring to sex as inclusive of gender identity, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock vs. Clayton County, but Trump has rejected that.

Trump has also sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, as well as federalized National Guard troops, to several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago. San Francisco was about to be added to that list, with border patrol agents showing up to the Alameda Coast Guard facility last week shortly before Trump called off a planned “surge” in the Bay Area.

As the Bay Area Reporter reported, Mayor Daniel Lurie stated Trump phoned him last week and called off the operation after he told Trump the city’s economy was recovering and public safety had been improved.

“We appreciate that the president understands that we are the global hub for technology, and when San Francisco is strong, our country is strong,” Lurie stated.

Trump wrote on social media that “friends of mine who live in the area” were key to the decision, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who he said spoke highly of Lurie and of the city’s efforts to turn the corner on crime. (Benioff had previously told reporters he welcomed National Guard troops to the city before backtracking amid fierce criticism from local leaders.)

Trump stated October 23, “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it [San Francisco] around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the law does not permit him to remove. I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?’ The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.”

Even before Benioff’s comments, Trump had referenced sending National Guard troops to San Francisco on more than one occasion. The operation that was expected to begin last week did not include Guard troops, though San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told the B.A.R. city leaders thought an immigration enforcement surge was a pretext to do so later on.

Navarro, who works for the Mission Neighborhood Health Center, said her asylum claim was recently accepted.

4 trans commissioners

Navarro is one of four trans-identified commissioners on the city’s oversight bodies – the others being Monroe Lace of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, Joaquin Guerrero of the Homeless Oversight Commission, and Cecilia Chung of the Commission on the Status of Women.

In late September, Lurie took some heat for opting not to reappoint Jane Natoli, a trans woman, to the airport commission.

Navarro had a competitor for the seat in city resident Samim B. Shaikh, who is a co-chair for the Yaseen Women's Committee, an Islamic community association in Burlingame.

Shaikh said she has a degree in international relations and did “research centering on the factors driving global migration.”

In her application seeking appointment, Shaikh said, “As an immigrant myself I believe it is important to recognize and understand the diversity in immigrant communities, the diversity within countries of origin, and the reasons for immigration as well as the immense challenges that immigrant communities face.”

Mandelman said that ultimately, “It’s not great when you have two folks who you want to see both on the body come forward, but I do feel at this particular moment, the balance comes for Jessy Ruiz Navarro.”

Indy airport says it can’t stop ICE flights The Indianapolis Airport Authority said the federal government does not have to tell them about the ICE flights, including their duration or frequency.","Last Friday morning, more than 80 flights departed from the Indianapolis International Airport. But one, boarding around 11:30 a.m., was unlike the others.

The passengers were in handcuffs. They stood on the tarmac, next to three vans and a coach-style bus. Dozens were soon loaded onto an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flight.

Who the detainees are, or where they are from, is unclear. But they were bound for Alexandria, Louisiana — the Trump administration’s major deportation hub, where immigration lawyers warn due process rights disappear.

The Oct. 24 departure was one of more than four dozen ICE flights that moved through the Indianapolis airport, records show, since early July. In an email, the Indianapolis Airport Authority said ICE is using the runways three times a week. But if you’re flying out, you probably won’t see them.

Detainees on charter flights depart from a private facility tucked away on the north side of the airport, separate from the main buildings. It’s the same area where politicians and professional sports teams fly in and out.

ICE did not answer questions about the flights or respond to requests for comment.

But Mirror Indy witnessed men with badges, including one wearing a black jacket that said “POLICE ICE,” shuffle groups of people with bound wrists onto an Eastern Air Express flight. The airline, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is one of three working with the federal government to rapidly transport people between detention centers and out of the country.

The scale of this federal operation is unprecedented, said Savi Arvey, an immigration researcher. She heads the ICE Flight Monitor team, a nationwide project run by a human rights group tracking the planes in real-time. Last month, as the number of ICE flights hit a record high across the country, Indianapolis caught their attention for the first time.

“It’s a new ICE Air destination,” Arvey said.

‘No meaningful due process’

Angela Joseph, an Indianapolis immigration attorney, is used to her clients being moved around the Midwest. But this year, some started popping up in detention centers in Louisiana.

“I didn’t know about the ICE flights,” Joseph told Mirror Indy. “But nothing this administration does surprises me anymore.”

She is among advocates who say the Trump administration is moving immigrants around to isolate them from family and from lawyers trying to defend them. Immigration is generally a civil matter, and non-citizens have constitutional rights to hire legal counsel in deportation cases and receive a fair hearing before a judge. According to federal data from September, people with no criminal record now make up the largest group in ICE detention.

“There’s no meaningful due process,” Joseph said. “Before you can do anything legally, they’re on a plane and back in their home country.”

Local flight data reviewed by Mirror Indy shows planes arriving here from Gary, Minneapolis and most recently, Youngstown, Ohio. At first, according to ICE Flight Monitor, a different airline was taking detainees from the Indy airport: Global X, which was flying regularly to another deportation hub in Harlingen, Texas. By Oct. 8, Eastern Air Express had taken over with weekly flights to Alexandria, Louisiana.

Both airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Neither did Million Air, a fixed-base operator at the Indianapolis airport. The luxury company based in Houston services private planes at locations across the country with fuel, maintenance and ground support. It took care of celebrities and athletes flying in for the Indy 500 and NBA All-Star Weekend.

On Oct. 24, two Mirror Indy journalists observed an Eastern Air Express flight taxiing to Million Air’s facility off of Pierson Drive. They watched from the parking lot as workers set up stairs for boarding and began servicing the Boeing 737.

Before any people boarded, a Million Air employee told Mirror Indy’s reporter and photojournalist to leave.

“So these are ICE flights with detainees?” the reporter asked.

“This is private property,” the employee replied.

Mirror Indy then went to a public road and shot pictures of the flight from about 900 yards away. Photos show detainees lined up, waiting to board. They wore regular clothes — a requirement listed in the 2024 ICE Air Operations Handbook. The manual outlines how detainees must be fully restrained on the planes with handcuffs, shackles and leg irons.

“If the flight goes down, is someone going to unshackle them?” Joseph, the immigration attorney, asked.

Indy airport says it can’t stop ICE flights

The Indianapolis Airport Authority said the federal government does not have to tell them about the ICE flights, including their duration or frequency.

The airport was informed about ICE’s activities in September, a spokesperson said. ICE Flight Monitor tracked the federal agency using the airways in Indianapolis as early as July, though records show flights ramped up in September.

“The Indianapolis International Airport is a federally regulated public use facility,” an airport spokesperson said in an Oct. 22 statement to Mirror Indy. “The IAA must comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations and cannot interfere with or restrict federal and civil aviation activities.”

That answer — along with the silence of the airlines and companies involved — was not satisfying to advocates.

“I don’t think most Indy residents want an airport we really love to be part of a deportation machine,” said Josh Riddick, an organizer with Live Free Indiana. “We have to figure out who is passively sitting by while ICE expands its footprint in our city.”

The group has repeatedly protested the Marion County Sheriff’s Office for working with ICE this year to hold detainees in the local jail. From January through mid-October, records show nearly 800 people have been housed there at some point. The sheriff’s office does not transport detainees to the airport for ICE flights, a spokesperson said.

Two weeks ago, Riddick visited with immigrants inside Indy’s jail. Some, he said, were so defeated they agreed to voluntary departure. Others wanted to fight their cases.

That’s much harder, advocates say, once someone has been moved out of state in a few short hours. Deportation flights were common under the Bush, Obama and Biden administrations. But the scale has grown immensely under Trump 2.0, which is also transferring more people between states.

“These planes are going to Louisiana for a reason,” Riddick told Mirror Indy. “That’s a location where the government wins in court and expedites deportations. Our neighbors and friends are being put in a black box so the Trump administration can force a victory.”

‘Enough resistance’

Other communities across the country are reckoning with their airports becoming a pit-stop in the deportation process.

In Seattle, advocates are monitoring ICE flights with live video feeds and pressing the private airlines and companies involved to stop working with federal agents. In Massachusetts, ICE initially stopped flights at Hanscom Field after public outcry, but resumed them in September. And in New Hampshire, community members are demanding answers from the Pease County Development Authority — though officials there say the airport will lose all federal grants if it defies ICE.

“Ultimately, if all airports took a stand, ICE couldn’t operate,” said Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer working to stop the flights at Portsmouth International Airport. “If there is enough resistance in enough places to slow things down, that allows more people to actually have their day in court.”

Indianapolis may be the next chapter in the fight.

“The airport has some control over who does business on their property and which companies they allow,” said Riddick, the organizer with Live Free Indiana. “Somebody is aware of this and they’ve been quiet about it.”

Joseph, the local immigration attorney, has her eyes set on the private companies involved in the Indianapolis flights: Eastern Air Express, Global X and Million Air.

To her, the answer is simple.

“We won’t support businesses that are helping tear families apart,” she said.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences.","On August 15, 2025, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

Impacts on Employers

Position Statements Matter More Than Ever: Without a guaranteed fact-finding conference, employers lose the chance to “fill in the gaps” or clarify their story in person. This means that the position statement and its supporting documentary evidence will likely carry more weight. Employers assume these filings will be the primary record on which the IDHR bases its determination.

Employers Face a Critical Choice: Employers must decide whether a fact-finding conference helps or hurts their case. Opting in would give employers the opportunity to see the complainant’s testimony and test their credibility, the chance to directly explain their defenses to the investigator, and a possible opening for early settlement. On the other hand, opting in extends the IDHR’s timeline by 120 days, prolonging uncertainty, gives the complainant a platform to expand or refine their claims, and increases legal fees and preparation time.

Fewer Early Settlement Opportunities: Employers can no longer count on fact-finding conferences to provide an informal settlement forum. Instead, employers who are open to early resolution should explore the Department’s voluntary mediation program or work with counsel to negotiate directly with the complainant.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment.
Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.
Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.
“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said.","All over the United States, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been under fire for infringing on the rights of civilians and taking measures that are well beyond its jurisdiction. This ranges from detaining people without due process to detaining citizens, to forced entry into homes and smashing windows to pull suspected undocumented persons out of their cars.

With the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July, ICE’s budget has nearly tripled.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment. U.S. police departments are infamous for racial profiling, use of excessive force, and abuse of power. Though hardly an outlier, SPD has an especially long history of alleged racism and unnecessary use of violence.

In 2020, a lawsuit was filed against SPD by Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County for its indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, tear gas, batons, and chemical irritants on protestors, medical personnel, journalists, and legal spectators as a means of “crowd control” during the George Floyd protests. SPD was found guilty of violating free speech rights for its actions.

The recent Keep Washington Working Act, passed by the Washington State Legislature, places limitations on how local police cooperate with ICE, but it doesn’t prevent them from joining. Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.

“It is a tool of authoritarianism, and it's a tool of fear, especially,” Mathieu Chabaud, chair of Students for a Democratic Society’s UW chapter, said. “We're seeing in Chicago, with the deployments of the National Guard, that these appointments are meant to make people feel afraid. They are meant to drive people into their homes, to make them fearful of going to work, to make them fearful of organizing.”

Chabaud also pointed out that Trump’s intimidation tactics disproportionately impact immigrant and Chicano communities.

“Now, ultimately, I think that the larger concern for me is not necessarily if SPD officers are quitting to go work for ICE, but if they're just working with ICE under the table … you have all these surveillance cameras, right? If they’re somehow accessing these surveillance records because they've gone through other agencies to request them,” Chabaud said.

ICE has been known to use surveillance databases to track people with the help of local law enforcement agencies. In 2019, it was revealed that ICE agencies in San Francisco used driver location data provided to them by local police for deportations, in violation of the California Values Act. Seattle is big on police surveillance, with new CCTV cameras and a “Real Time Crime Center” recently being approved despite community pushback about privacy concerns and misuse of the data. Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.

“I don't doubt that there are members of SPD, of UWPD, of all these private security officers hired through Seattle's finest that want to work with ICE under the table,” Chabaud said. “Whether that's calling up somebody that they know in ICE saying, ‘Hey, I saw this person today, I don't think that they're a citizen’ … or just outright breaking the law themselves and intimidating students on the basis of their immigration status.”

There are millions of illegal European immigrants in the U.S. Why isn’t ICE cracking down on them? The answer is simple. Obviously, racism plays a role, but when we look at the jobs minority immigrants tend to work — blue-collar, low-pay — it becomes very evident very quickly that the Trump administration is using ICE to scare historically underpaid and overworked communities out of unionizing and rebelling.

The general slanderous narratives that Republicans try to push about immigrants — that they’re rapists, that they’re criminals, that they steal jobs — are yet another tool used by the elite to sow division and to keep the masses from developing class consciousness and organizing against the real criminals: the billionaires, like Trump, who exploit us.

Immigrants are invaluable to our society. They contribute trillions to the GDP and housing wealth, and they keep our food system afloat, in part because their labor is so heavily exploited. They enrich our country with their cultures. But beyond their servitude, immigrants are human beings who deserve to be treated as such. No child should be ripped away from their family. No worker should be afraid that if they advocate for themselves, their bosses will get them thrown out of the country.

It’s going to take a lot of time, effort, and resources to change things on a national scale, but what we can do right now is take a stand on our campus.

“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said. “And every other university in Washington state is saying a very different thing: We will not allow ICE to come on campus, we will not provide them any resources.”

Earlier this year, UW hosted Homeland Security agents on campus for their ”Career as a Special Agent” workshop, prompting backlash and protests in response.

Chabaud raised important points about how, in addition to not actively bringing these agents on campus, UW can take many actions to help protect the immigrant student body. They can create and send out alerts if ICE comes to campus, provide training for staff and students about what to do if ICE comes on campus, and make sure they aren’t hiring campus security officers who would collaborate with ICE against UW’s students. He explained how SDS and other student activist groups and unions are pressuring UW to make those changes.

“I actually just happened to run into President [Robert] Jones on Friday, and very quickly it was clear that he wasn't happy with what we're doing,” Chabaud said. “But we wouldn't be doing what we're doing if we saw real action from this administration … it's his choices that mean that students are walking up to him every time that they see him on campus and asking, ‘Why aren't you doing more?’”

International and undocumented students are an important part of our UW community. UW needs to do more to protect them.

FROM THE WILDERNESS: Nearly a year out from the 2024 election, Democrats are still searching for their way out of the wilderness and looking for a unified direction amid concerns over a party brand that lost ground with key voting blocs. And with a little over a year until the midterms, the party’s moderate wing is pitching their way forward.

Among the biggest messaging battles Dems will confront going into next year is President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda — from his pledges to carry out the largest mass deportation program in history to masked ICE agents conducting raids across major Democrat run-cities to the National Guard deployments to protect ICE agents.

First in Playbook: A new memo from centrist think tank Third Way finds an “electorate caught between two unsatisfying extremes: the cruelty of Trump’s policies and the perception that Democrats can’t maintain order at the border.” The latest data, shared exclusively with Playbook, shows that Democrats are still struggling to make inroads on immigration in the wake of a messy border policy under the Biden administration that is sticking in the minds of voters. Read the memo

The GOP dip: Support for Republicans’ handling of immigration slightly dropped from the last polling in March to September, down to 56 percent from 62 percent. But trust for Republicans’ handling of border security held steady at 66 percent.

But Dems aren’t breaking through: Democrats, meanwhile, “made modest but significant gains: their 30-point deficit on trust in immigration shrank to 20 points. Yet, the 40-point deficit on border security persisted. That’s a crucial distinction — because while voters are softening in their views toward Trump and his party on immigration overall, they still don’t trust Democrats to manage the border responsibly.” The report draws from a focus group of 55 swing voters and a national survey of 800 general election voters and 516 voters in battleground House districts.

But but but: The temptation for Democrats to blanket denounce all of the Trump administration’s most extreme measures is strong, but not effective, Third Way’s Sarah Pierce told Playbook. “They shouldn’t be criticizing everything the Trump administration is doing, because some of this is in line with what voters want to see,” she told Playbook. “Democrats really need to be putting themselves forward as joining voters on the ground they’re standing on.”

Who’s doing it right: Pierce pointed to Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), whose campaign in battleground Arizona could serve as a roadmap, she argued. “Ruben Gallego overperformed the entire Democratic ticket in Arizona and across the nation because of how he leaned into talking about immigration,” Chuck Rocha, who worked on Gallego’s campaign, told Playbook. Gallego would “have conversations with people about immigration, working in class economic issues … but the big thing he did was actually show up and listen.”

And Democrats’ challenge to break through on immigration spills into other key issues, per a new report out today.

It’s still the economy, stupid: The report from centrist WelcomePAC outlines how Democrats have to talk more about the economy and less about democracy, pushing a move toward kitchen table issues and moderate stances on immigration and crime, POLITICO’s Lisa Kashinsky reports. It features input from big names in Dem politics like David Axelrod, James Carville and David Plouffe to provide a sweeping analysis that is less an autopsy report and more an “indictment of the party’s leftward shift since the Obama administration.”

A woke-up call: The report, which was scooped by Semafor’s David Weigel, shows that a majority of voters believe Democrats are getting “out of touch” by focusing on LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. In the same vein, it warned elected Democrats to “abandon some of the progressive language about race, abortion, and LGBTQ issues that Democrats began using after the 2012 election — and recommends the nomination of more candidates willing to vote with Republicans on conservative immigration and crime bills.”

TRAIL MIX: We’re almost a week out from Election Day. Early voting in the NYC mayoral race is projecting high turnout for the off-year election, with more than 160,000 voting over the weekend, NYT’s Benjamin Oreskes and Maya King report. In Virginia, Dem candidate Abigail Spanberger maintains a comfortable lead in the race for governor despite an onslaught of attacks from GOP candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, NYT’s Reid Epstein writes.

That said, the middle-of-the-road Dem candidates running in Virginia and New Jersey have been underperforming compared to the ever-growing enthusiasm for Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in NYC, WSJ’s Joseph De Avila and Anvee Bhutani write. Despite Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s leads, neither race is a lock, with concerns persisting about whether their messaging has broken through with voters.

An eye toward 2026: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander is privately planning a bid to challenge Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) next year, City & State New York’s Peter Sterne reports. … And Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner’s campaign manager, Kevin Brown, is leaving after just days on the job, Axios’ Holly Otterbein scoops.

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Hoosier hoopla: Fair Maps Indiana, a project of Defending America’s Comeback Inc., is launching a 501c4 nonprofit organization to back mid-cycle redistricting in the Hoosier State, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. The effort comes ahead of next week’s special session called today by Gov. Mike Braun and is led by a number of Trump campaign alums, including top advisers and strategists Chris LaCivita, Chip Englander and John Brabender.

“States such as Illinois and California have gerrymandered their Congressional maps for decades,” said Marty Obst, who will serve as chair of Fair Maps Indiana. “The Indiana General Assembly has an opportunity to redraw the lines and play a meaningful role in maintaining our majorities in Congress. Our goal is to strongly support efforts to do so.”

The latest redistricting salvo: New York is joining in the redistricting arms race, as a new lawsuit filed by Elias Law Group today alleges that Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’ (R-N.Y.) district was unfairly drawn to disenfranchise voters of color, NYT’s Grace Ashford and Nick Corasaniti report. “Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.”

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: It’s day 27 of the shutdown, with paychecks missing and air travel delayed across the country. The pain has reached an inflection point for many federal workers: their largest union this morning called for an end to the shutdown and for Democrats to join Republicans to pass the “clean” stopgap funding bill, NBC’s Monica Alba scoops. “Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” the American Federation of Government Employee statement reads.

Republicans are running out of patience as Democrats jam the Senate — once again confronting the thorny issue of the filibuster and whether to get rid of it, WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes. But Democrats are working in lockstep, and they’re prepared to stick together on their strategy in the near future, CNN’s Sarah Ferris and Ellis Kim report.

This week: Talks abound about how to pay federal workers and air traffic controllers, with potential votes this week on those smaller bills, per Punchbowl. But these talks are still very much a work-in-progress, per Semafor’s Burgess Everett.

3. FED UP: The Federal Reserve’s next meeting kicks off tomorrow, where the central bank is widely expected to once again slash interest rates amid growing concerns on the slowing labor market. We could see a reduction of rates by a quarter of a percentage point come Wednesday, when Chair Jerome Powell makes his announcement, especially as the most recent inflation numbers proved cooler than expected, Reuters’ Ann Saphir reports.

Driving the decision: The Fed meeting comes not only as Trump is in Asia finalizing trade agreements, but also as the government shutdown prolongs the release of key government data that usually helps drive the Fed’s policy changes. The September jobs report wasn’t released and October data hasn’t been collected, the USDA’s export sales report hasn’t come out, key demographic data has been delayed.

The short list: Bessent confirmed the five finalists today being considered to succeed Powell and said Trump will make his final decision by the end of the year, Bloomberg’s Josh Wingrove reports. In the running: current Fed board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. Bessent is doing another round of interviews and will give Trump a “good slate” after Thanksgiving.

4. WHERE’S THE BEEF?: Trump’s frustration with spiking beef prices and his vow to bring prices down have led the White House to lean on beef from Argentina, which “has spurred intense backlash from farm-state Republicans and agriculture industry groups who have felt burned by several Trump administration policies in recent months,” POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Grace Yarrow report. “Ten months in, Trump and his top aides are scrambling to keep the campaign pledge, calculating that in the short-term it’s worth antagonizing ranchers, a loyal GOP constituency that benefits from elevated beef prices, if they can bring down costs for consumers.”

5. WAR AND PEACE: Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said he will meet with Trump in an effort to blunt the effect that U.S. sanctions on Russian oil will have on Hungary, which relies on Moscow for oil and gas imports, Bloomberg’s Zoltan Simon and Marton Kasnyik report. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui to strengthen the countries’ military ties, Bloomberg’s Greg Sullivan reports.

Big read: “Is the U.S. Losing in Vietnam? Russia, North Korea and China Are Gaining,” by NYT’s Damien Cave: “U.S. allies worry that American volatility and Russian outreach and arms sales, in particular, are driving Vietnam into a new phase.”

6. YOU DON’T KNOW JACK: “How Jack Smith’s strongest case against Donald Trump collapsed,” by Aaron Davis and Carol Leonnig for WaPo, adapted from the pair’s forthcoming book, “Injustice: How Politics and Fear Vanquished America’s Justice Department” ($29.76): “This behind-the-scenes account reveals new details about the inner workings of [Jack] Smith’s highly secretive team as he pushed it to complete a historic investigation in record time … it recounts for the first time Smith’s effort to remove [Judge Aileen Cannon] from the case, an idea that a top Justice Department official rejected and that Smith never presented to Attorney General Merrick Garland.”

7. SECURITY DETAILS: “Hundreds of People With ‘Top Secret’ Clearance Exposed by House Democrats’ Website,” by Wired’s Lily Newman and Matt Burgess: “The people’s details were included in a database of more than 7,000 individuals who have applied for jobs over the last two years with Democrats in the [House]. … The researcher found data including applicants’ short written biographies and fields indicating military service, security clearances, and languages spoken, along with details like names, phone numbers, and email addresses. … The data also included information about people’s political affiliations.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump said he underwent an MRI scan during his trip to Walter Reed Medical Center, but did not say why or which part of his body was scanned, POLITICO’s Dan Goldberg reports. “It was perfect,” Trump told reporters.

MEDIA MOVES — “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson is leaving the network in mid-December, according to an internal announcement scooped by The Guardian’s Jeremy Barr. … Caitlin Valleskey is now an event manager at NOTUS. She previously was at the DNC.

The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it.
… The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented.","When it comes to fighting America’s drug problem, the Trump administration seems to have traded courtrooms for combat zones. The U.S. military has been carrying out air and sea strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela.

Officials say these operations are meant to stop “narco-terrorists” before they reach our shores, but here’s the problem: we don’t actually know who’s being killed, or what evidence proves they were drug traffickers in the first place.

According to the administration, at least 43 people have been killed since this campaign began. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the military has conducted its 10th strike so far — and there’s talk of land strikes coming next. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) even told CBS News that he thinks President Trump has decided “it’s time for Maduro to go,” talking about the Venezuelan leader and calling land strikes a “real possibility.”

Graham then doubled down, saying the military will “kill the people that want to poison America.”

But let’s pause. Because while Graham sounds ready to invade and escalate, other lawmakers — even Republicans — are sounding the alarm. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a longtime defender of the Constitution, went on “Fox News Sunday” and said he’s never been invited to any briefing about these attacks.

“A briefing is not enough to overcome the Constitution. The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. … The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented. So at this point we would call them extrajudicial killings.”

Paul didn’t stop there. “At this point,” he said, “this is what China does, this is what Iran does without ever presenting any evidence to the public. So it’s wrong.”

And that’s really the point — America was built on checks and balances. We’re supposed to be the country that demands proof before punishment, not one that bombs suspects at sea without due process.

Yet the White House is openly suggesting it doesn’t need Congress. Trump even told reporters, “We’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we are doing … but we don’t have to do that.”

So, let me get this straight. If 43 people were killed in a law enforcement operation, with no evidence shown, no transparency, and no vote from Congress — what exactly do we call that? “The war on drugs” or “the war without rules”?

Because when a government decides it can kill whoever it labels a criminal — without trial, without proof, and without oversight — that’s not a show of strength. That’s a red flag.

At the very least, Americans deserve answers. Who was killed? Why? And under what legal authority? Until we know that, calling these “extrajudicial killings” isn’t radical — it’s reality.

In separate letters sent to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week, ACE called for an exemption for higher education institutions from the new $100,000 H-1B application fee—now in effect following the launch of DHS’s official payment portal and accompanying guidance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—and urged withdrawal of a new rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels.

Both policies stemmed from President Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers. Together, the groups warned, they would undermine U.S. colleges and universities’ ability to attract global talent and fulfill their role in educating the domestic workforce for high-demand sectors.

Higher Education Calls for Exemption from $100,000 H-1B Fee

ACE and 29 higher education associations are urging DHS to exempt colleges and universities from the new $100,000 fee now being implemented for H-1B visa applications.

In an Oct. 23 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the associations said the Sept. 19 presidential proclamation establishing the fee would place an “extraordinary and unnecessary burden” on institutions that rely on H-1B visa holders to teach, conduct research, and provide medical and technical expertise in areas of national need—including health care, engineering, and computer science.

The groups noted that the proclamation allows DHS to issue exemptions in the national interest and called on the department to recognize higher education’s central role in training the U.S. workforce.

They also requested clarification on how DHS will implement the fee, including whether the payment will be refunded for denied petitions, how it will affect changes of status, and what metrics will determine when no U.S. worker is available for a role.

The USCIS guidance released alongside the portal clarified that the fee applies to new petitions for individuals outside the United States and does not appear to cover F-1 students transitioning to H-1B status. However, many other aspects of the policy remain unclear.

Citing data from CUPA-HR showing that more than 70 percent of H-1B faculty hold tenure-track or tenured positions, the letter emphasized that colleges and universities already operate under strict hiring and compliance requirements. The associations asked DHS to ensure higher education is treated consistently with its long-standing exemption from the H-1B lottery cap, granted by Congress in recognition of its national-interest role.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers also sent a letter to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week warning that the fee is “prohibitively expensive” and could harm small employers and innovation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a legal challenge, and additional lawsuits are underway.

ACE Opposes DHS Proposal to Prioritize H-1B Visas by Wage Level

ACE and 18 other higher education associations are also urging DHS to withdraw a proposed rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels, warning that it would disadvantage international graduates of U.S. colleges and universities and discourage new student enrollment.

In Oct. 24 comments submitted to DHS, the associations said the rule “would dramatically reduce access to the H-1B visa program for early career professionals, including those who have completed master’s or doctoral degrees at U.S. institutions of higher education.” They added that the policy would also harm foreign-born medical residents and other professionals in critical national-need areas.

“America’s colleges and universities are among the finest in the world,” they wrote in the comments. “This proposed rule will limit the ability of our institutions to recruit and retain talented students, especially those who wish to remain in the United States.”

The associations warned that the change could exacerbate an ongoing drop in international student enrollment. A recent NAFSA survey found potential declines of 30–40 percent in international enrollment for the 2025–26 academic year, representing an estimated $7 billion loss to the U.S. economy.

Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted that the Trump administration could send immigration agents to polling places in an attempt to intimidate voters and depress turnout.

The governor’s warnings, while unspecific, speak to what community leaders call real, palpable fears within some Latino communities that immigration agents could show up on Election Day. And ever since the Supreme Court greenlit using racial profiling in immigration stops, even U.S. citizens are scared they could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

“You’re going to likely see members of our military in and around polling booths and voting places all across this country,” Newsom warned last week during a virtual event with former President Barack Obama in support of Proposition 50. “I would say the same about ICE and Border Patrol, and I say that soberly.”

Newsom has not provided any evidence to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will deploy immigration agents to polling sites. But he pointed to the Los Angeles campaign launch event for Prop. 50, his plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, where federal immigration agents blocked supporters from entering the area and detained a nearby strawberry vendor.

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote in a statement that the agency “is not planning operations targeting polling locations,"" but that if agents are tracking ""a dangerous criminal alien"" who goes near a voting site they could be arrested there. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol did not respond to emailed questions.

The governor argues that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate immigration raids, military and National Guard deployments are intended to suppress Democratic voters and keep Republicans in control of Congress for the duration of Trump’s presidency.

“We know the intention of this administration — to rig next year’s midterms,” Newsom told reporters recently. “It’s absolutely predictable. It’s a script that’s been written for centuries. It’s the authoritarian playbook.”

The Trump administration’s Justice Department announced on Friday that it will deploy personnel to monitor polling sites in five counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside on Election Day. Fresno, Kern and Riverside counties are majority Latino.

The poll monitors will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,” according to the department. The administration has not said whether the agents will be stationed at polling sites in addition to county election offices where ballots are counted.

Democrats denounced the plan.

“Deploying federal forces to ‘monitor’ elections is nothing more than an intimidation tactic meant to suppress the vote,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party. “What Republicans are really afraid of is record voter participation and a clear verdict from the people of California in support of Prop 50.”

‘Alarming’ number of Latinos fear ICE at polls

The vast majority of Californians vote by mail, especially since the state adopted universal mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just over 80% of votes cast in the 2024 presidential election were mail-in ballots.

But casting a ballot in-person on Election Day is a point of pride for many American immigrants, especially Latinos, said Yvette Martinez, executive director of the California Democratic Party.

“It’s a cultural thing,” said Martinez. “People want to show up and say, ‘I’m patriotic, here’s my civic duty. I’m here to vote, I’m here to make my voice heard. And when you quell that, it’s dangerous. And it’s actually sad.”

In a September survey of 1,200 registered Latino voters conducted by the Latino Community Foundation, a nonprofit that funds Latino advocacy, 53% said they planned to vote in person. Of those, more than half said they would vote on Election Day.

The same survey also found that two-thirds of the Latino voters surveyed said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. The poll had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

“These are citizens of this country. And if they are concerned about immigration or any type of federal presence at in-person voting sites, that is alarming,” said Christian Arana, who leads policy strategy for the foundation.

“If people want to vote in person, it is their fundamental right,” Arana said. “I never want us to buy into the fear that you can't participate in democracy because immigration enforcement may show up.”

Hendricks for CalMatters So far in the race for Prop. 50, only 9% of registered Latino voters have returned their ballots, according to the most recent data available from Political Data Inc., compared to 19% of white voters and 13% of Black voters. California pollster Ben Tulchin, who recently surveyed Latino voters about Prop. 50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots.

Sen. Anna Caballero, Democrat of Merced, said U.S. citizens told her they’re afraid to go outside, especially when there have been reports of ICE sightings in the region. Many of her constituents come from mixed-status families in which some family members are citizens and others aren’t. She blames the Trump administration for terrifying those families so much that they don’t want to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.

“This idea that all you have to do is pull out your driver's license, or pull out some kind of documentation, that's a fantasy,” said Caballero. “U.S. citizens have been detained and taken into custody.”

A recent investigation by ProPublica found that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by ICE since the second Trump administration took office, prompting intense criticism from opponents. Top Democrats on the House and Senate government oversight committees, Rep. Robert Garcia of California and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have opened an investigation.

Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, another Merced Democrat and the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said ever since the Supreme Court issued its racial profiling ruling earlier this summer, she keeps her passport in her bag at all times.

“Just because you may look like an immigrant — which I don't even know what that really means — you know, I could also be targeted,” Soria said.

‘My voice will be heard’

Opponents of Newsom’s redistricting plan say the governor’s warnings about Election Day intimidation and interference from federal agents are exaggerated.

“People see it for what it is. It’s politics, it’s headline-grabbing,” said Hector Barajas, a spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign.

Barajas denounced Democrats for what he said was intentional disenfranchisement of nonwhite voters, since white college-educated voters are historically far more likely to turn out during off-year elections.

“This is what happens with special elections, is people don't turn out to vote, especially Hispanics, which is a sad tragedy in itself,” Barajas said.

Martinez said Democratic Party volunteers are for the first time urging voters to return their ballots early via mail or drop-off when they go door to door and handing out pamphlets with instructions for how to report any suspicious activity near polling sites.

The party has also trained hundreds of volunteers as poll watchers who will monitor polling sites for signs of intimidation or federal interference starting the weekend before Election Day.

Arana, with the Latino Community Foundation, said he’s choosing to vote in person as an act of defiance.

“I'm seeing this as a form of a declaration that I am a Latino man in the state,” he said. “My voice will be heard on this issue, and no one is ever gonna take that right away from me.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/554a712/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+106/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2Fac%2F18cc8a284209a36110eec9d08b02%2Felection-primary-ts-0607-07.JPG,N,,2025-10-27 15:01:37.251340

The death of Josué Castro Rivera follows recent incidents in which three other immigrants in Chicago and California were killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job Thursday when his vehicle was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, brother Henry Castro said.

Agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and the three other passengers, and he fled on foot, tried to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk and was fatally struck, according to state and federal authorities.

Castro Rivera came to the United States four years ago and was working to send money to family in Honduras, according to his brother.

“He had a very good heart,” Castro said Sunday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Castro Rivera’s vehicle was stopped by ICE as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation and passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission.

DHS said in a statement that Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle struck him. DHS officials did not respond Sunday to requests for further comment.

Virginia State Police said officers responded to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash around 11 a.m. Thursday on eastbound I-264 at the Military Highway interchange. Police said Rivera was hit by a 2002 Ford pickup and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation.

Federal authorities and state police gave his first name as Jose, but family members said it was Josué. DHS and state police did not explain the discrepancy.

Castro called his brother’s death an injustice and said he is raising money to transport the body back to Honduras for funeral.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Castro said.

DHS blamed Castro Rivera’s death on “a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths amid immigration operations elsewhere have triggered protests, lawsuits and calls for investigation amid claims that the Trump administration’s initial accounts are misleading.

Last month in suburban Chicago, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop. DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “ nothing major.”

In July a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid at a California cannabis facility died of his injuries. And in August a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Whip Emmer on federal workers impacted by the Democrat government shutdown:

“Senator Kaine and his colleagues have literally given the administration and Donald J. Trump all the authority they need to do what they have to do to make the difficult choices that are going to have to be made to make sure that the essential services are still provided, and that decision will be between essential and non-essential. Which is probably why this morning, Bill, the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest government employee union in the country, called on the Democrats to pass a clean CR and get the government open. This is getting very dangerous for a lot of Tim Kaine's constituents.”

Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.
State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week.
“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued.
Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.","LINCOLN — A district court judge in southwest Nebraska will let the state move forward with Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.

Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng, in a 17-page ruling Monday, ruled that Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, did not violate the Nebraska Constitution or state law by entering into a Sept. 30 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook into a regional ICE detention center.

ICE certified the facility last week, Pillen announced Thursday. State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week. A hearing on the motion was held Friday, and the lawsuit will continue.

“It is clear that the current situation with the department and ICE detainees was never contemplated when the statutes were created, but the language utilized by the Legislature is broad enough to allow the defendants to take the action they have chosen,” Heng wrote.

Pillen and federal officials announced the Nebraska-ICE partnership Aug. 19. Jeffreys signed the contract on Sept. 30, which was released to the public Oct. 17, two days after the lawsuit was filed.

A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office referred questions to the Governor’s Office, and Pillen’s office had no immediate comment.

Nebraska Appleseed attorneys who filed the lawsuit Oct. 15 on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, expressed disappointment that the court did not stop the changes.

In a statement, Robert McEwen, Appleseed’s legal director, said he was pleased that Heng had let the case keep moving forward.

“The case will carry forward from here, and we will continue to represent the interests of our clients in halting the activities of the defendants as they relate to the large-scale detainment camp in McCook.”

Schimek was one of the original lawmakers who authorized the creation of the state’s Work Ethic Camp in 1997. It opened in 2001.

She and the taxpayers argued Pillen and Jeffreys were trying to “usurp” legislative authority by converting the McCook facility’s legislatively directed usage without first receiving legislative approval.

Heng overruled a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit — saying the taxpayers had a legal right to challenge the matter — but he denied a request to pause the state-federal partnership.

Heng also ruled that the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden of having the standing to sue, even as state attorneys for Pillen and Jeffreys had argued others might be better suited to challenge the action, such as the Legislature, displaced state inmates from the McCook facility or future federal detainees., he said the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden.

In denying the request for a temporary injunction, Heng pointed to the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions is done by the Legislature. His major question was whether the Legislature had delegated that authority.

“The answer is obviously, ‘yes,’” Heng wrote.

He pointed to the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and the authority of the governor to appoint a director, who then has general oversight of corrections oversight. Heng also ruled that Pillen and the executive branch have broad authority to enter contracts with the federal government.

“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued. “It has not done so here.”

To pause the Nebraska-ICE deal, Heng said the 14 taxpayers would have needed to show “irreparable harm,” probable success of succeeding on the merits and a balance of hardships in favor of the taxpayers over the government. Heng wrote that he was not yet convinced the plaintiffs were likely to succeed.

Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.

Heng said that while state law requires a work ethic camp, it doesn’t require one in McCook or Red Willow County. He said the location is a decision left to the corrections director, who has signed a sworn statement saying the rehabilitation offerings at the former McCook facility would be available at other state facilities.

“If there is not such a facility for qualified inmates,” Heng said, “that is not the subject matter of this lawsuit.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2560-scaled-e1761585676122-2048x1207.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:01:30.370856

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.","Congress has the constitutional power of the purse, but President Donald Trump’s robust assertion of executive authority is testing even that basic tenet of U.S. democracy.

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown .

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president's spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful , could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court's conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration's push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It's hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That's equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding , primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

""The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,"" said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. ""That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country's massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.""

""If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender , race , immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution's separation of powers by usurping Congress' authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People's Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court's conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department , freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health .

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions .

That's when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn't have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid , effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”","A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again.

What was supposed to be a Halloween parade in Old Irving Park turned to chaos as ICE agents appeared to deploy tear gas through residential streets last week. Outrage was sparked by the arrest of construction worker, Luis Villegas, whose family says he was working on a now-unfinished project before he was chased down and arrested by federal agents.

Tensions continued to grow after Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was photographed allegedly hauling a tear gas canister at protesters in little village. Monday morning, Bovino defended his actions.

""When we utilize force in law enforcement, this is in law enforcement in general: As we use force, it's the least amount of force necessary to affect an arrest or to affect the successful outcome of any given mission that we're on,"" Bovino said. ""So, whether it's the use of tear gas, or the use of hand techniques or any use of force by law enforcement, that's that least amount of force necessary to positively affect the outcome of that mission. And that's what we do here in Chicago.""

""I want to acknowledge the concern many residents are feeling in light of recent immigration enforcement activity in our area.","Federal immigration agents were seen in another Chicago suburb over the weekend, detaining people in a parking lot and breaking car windows.

The incident stirred fear among residents and led to a statement from the village’s mayor.

What we know:

The incident occurred around 8:45 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of 390 W. Lake St. in Addison, according to Addison police.

Officers responded to a report of a disturbance and found Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area. Police said a crowd gathered and officers ""ensured the safety of the public until the area was clear.""

Authorities did not release additional details about the incident and said no Addison officers took part in any federal immigration enforcement.

An area business posted a live video on Facebook, showing federal agents surrounding a vehicle in the parking lot and breaking a window with people inside.

The agents were then seen detaining at least one person and putting her inside their vehicle. Further details haven't been released.

Mayor speaks out:

Mayor Tom Hundley addressed residents’ concerns in a statement on social media.

""I want to acknowledge the concern many residents are feeling in light of recent immigration enforcement activity in our area. These events have understandably caused fear and uncertainty, and I want to assure you that your safety and dignity matter to me.

""While immigration enforcement is a federal matter and outside the authority of our local government, I want to reaffirm what the Police Department has already shared: our officers do not assist with federal immigration operations, do not inquire about immigration status, and are bound by the Illinois Trust Act to preclude involvement in such enforcement. Any federal presence in Addison has occurred without coordination or support from our police department.

""During any ongoing incident, our Police Department may respond to the area, just like we do for the Addison Fire Protection District. This is solely to ensure that bystanders are safe, traffic does not become an issue, and the area is secure. This is their only role.

""Addison is a diverse and vibrant community, and we are stronger because of the people who live and work here. Though our ability to intervene in federal matters is limited, I remain committed to ensuring that our Village continues to be a respectful and welcoming place for all.""

Inside an empty salon, owner Maky Munoz sits in a styling chair getting her hair dyed by the only employee on the clock. The pair don’t have any clients at the moment.

It’s an unusual case for a salon that used to be full of customers waiting for a haircut. Clients could hear razors buzzing, blow dryers going off and chatter between staff and employees.

The majority of her clientele now remains at home, she says, afraid to spend money due to immigration enforcement and rumors of increased activity in east Tulsa, the center of Latino life in the city. Her sales have dropped 75%.

Munoz is one of many local business owners in the area who are feeling the impacts of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign. There has been an increasing number of Immigration and Custom Enforcement sightings in recent months, leaving many in the community afraid to venture outside of their home.

An August research paper showed increased immigration enforcement has led to “economic damage” to construction, agriculture and leisure and hospitality industries, mostly from losing immigrant workers. The U.S. economy was already seeing a reduction in its immigrant workforce in 2024, according to the study.

On the ground, things look starker. There are widespread reports of immigrants across the country who are “reluctant” to show up for work because of fear that they or family members will be apprehended.

This fall, Munoz has noticed her regulars have more fear of ICE agents, especially when it comes to going to work, and are paying close attention to their presence in the community.

“They tell me, ‘Cut my hair short because I’m not coming back, I’m scared. I have my kids. They’re off to school. I’m putting myself at risk,’” Munoz said.

Rey Villalobos, owner of the restaurant La Torta Loca, saw a 30% drop in sales this summer at his restaurant inside Plaza Santa Cecilia. The plaza, home to restaurants, boutiques and clothing stores, has seen less foot traffic in recent years. Rumors of ICE’s presence in the area doesn’t help.

Villalobos has sold tortas there for seven years. Typically, he sells the best on the weekends, but that isn’t the case lately.

“July was probably one of the worst months we’ve had in a long time,” he said. “It just felt dead here. You could feel it in the air, like, nobody wanted to come by here, and I mean, it’s understandable.”

If Hispanics — his main clientele — are impacted, the business as a whole will feel the consequences, he said. People have told Villalobos that they’re saving money to return to Mexico.

“I imagine people don’t want to buy things, invest in stuff, buy cars for the reason of ‘I could be deported,’” he said.

He’s seen sales bounce back to normal with the arrival of fall, and the lunch rush of customers is slowly flowing back.

The fear, he said, remains. People are more aware of ICE’s presence and cautious in case something happens, he said.

Similarly, Karla Cruz has noticed fewer people coming out to spend money lately. The owner of Bellisima Boutique in Plaza Santa Cecilia said she understands people are scared but rent is still due at the end of each month.

Cruz sometimes has weeks where she doesn’t sell any items at the boutique and barely makes enough to stay open. Before the increase in immigration enforcement, she said people would at least come out and look at the store.

“If (people) do come, they’re coming fast and buying what they need and not stopping by and looking at the other stores anymore,” she said.

Sara Melgoza, who works at a furniture store in east Tulsa, noticed gas stations that were typically packed with customers were empty after social media posts about ICE being present near 21st and Garnett streets.

“It wasn’t only the day they said ICE was there, but the following day, too,” Melgoza said. “That week you could tell the terror that happens when they’re scared about a situation.”

Munoz, the salon owner, said she doesn’t just miss the sales but her clients as well. Fewer people of color and families are coming in for haircuts and the occasional therapy session that the salon provided.

“We just have to wait and see if all of this gets any better,” Munoz said. “It’s not easy to leave your country and be hit with the wolf.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2cea6da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2722x1429+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Faa%2F41%2F36c4ae6f4a19a31eb017d18f522b%2Fvillalobos-1.png,N,,2025-10-27 14:16:55.166522

The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.
This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.
Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state.
That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.","A lawsuit filed on Monday on behalf of four New Yorkers charges that the state’s congressional map unconstitutionally dilutes Black and Latino votes in a district that covers Staten Island and part of southern Brooklyn, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times.

The case marked New York’s official entrance into the national gerrymandering arms race. Rewriting the state’s existing congressional districts represents one of Democrats’ best hopes of improving their chances in the 2026 midterm elections.

Filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit argues that the lines for the 11th Congressional District unfairly disenfranchise Black and Latino residents under the state’s newly passed Voting Rights Act. The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.

The combined Black and Latino population on Staten Island has grown from 11 percent to 30 percent over the past 40 years, the suit notes, arguing that the current boundaries “confine Staten Island’s growing Black and Latino communities in a district where they are routinely and systematically unable to influence elections.”

A representative for Ms. Malliotakis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.

Filing a lawsuit is a far less certain path to redistricting than having a partisan legislature simply draw new maps and pass them into law, which is what Texas did earlier this year. But New York placed its redistricting process in the hands of an independent commission years ago, in hopes of insulating it from partisan politics.

Redrawing legislative boundaries for Congress and state legislatures is typically done at the start of the decade following the census. But the Trump White House has upended that cycle, pushing Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms in an effort to ensure the party maintains control of the House of Representatives.

Republicans have already redrawn maps in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, netting their party as many as seven likely pickups before any votes have been cast.

Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, the official head of the state Democratic Party, pledged to “fight fire with fire,” saying: “If they’re going to rig the system, I refuse to sit on the sidelines and let our democracy further erode any more than it already has under the Trump administration.”

But Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.

Democrats in Albany devised the current lines for New York’s 26 congressional districts after the state’s redistricting commission failed to come to a consensus and an unsuccessful attempt by the party to gerrymander to its advantage.

In addition to the states where maps have already been redrawn, the White House had mounted an aggressive push in Indiana to force the legislature to eliminate the state’s two Democratic districts, with the president himself calling legislators earlier this month to persuade them to draw new maps.

On Monday, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state. But immediately after his announcement, a spokeswoman for the state’s Senate Republican leadership said that “the votes still aren’t there for redistricting,” adding to the uncertainty surrounding the effort.

Republican leaders in both Kansas and Nebraska have indicated that they are open to redrawing ahead of the midterms, though neither have yet taken formal steps to do so. And Florida Republicans are contemplating new maps as well.

Until this month, the only Democratic countermove ahead of the midterms was in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a temporary suspension of the state’s independent redistricting commission in order to draw five new Democratic seats. That effort will need to be approved by voters this November in order to move forward.

But last week, Virginia Democrats made the surprise announcement that they would also embark on an effort to redraw their maps should Democrats hold both chambers of the legislature this November, possibly netting two or three more seats for Democrats. The legislature is expected to meet on Monday to begin the process.

This has left the courts as one of the last remaining avenues for a state like New York, which passed a law establishing the bipartisan commission to redraw its maps in 2014.

That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. But after months of public hearings, the commission’s Democratic and Republican members failed to agree on a single set of maps, sending the job back to the Democratic majorities in the State Legislature.

Democrats there quickly passed a set of maps that would have favored their party in 22 of the state’s 26 congressional seats — called “a master class” in gerrymandering by one elections expert. But those maps were thrown out by a judge, who appointed a special master to draw a new set of lines.

Republicans went on to capture four seats in 2022, a margin that was equal to the slim four-member majority the party won in the House of Representatives that year.

Democrats sued and ultimately won the opportunity to redraw the maps one more time. Leery of another protracted battle, they created maps last year that only slightly benefited their party.

Only three of the 26 districts were meaningfully changed: the 22nd District in Syracuse, the 19th District in the Hudson Valley and the 3rd on Long Island. Democrats won all three in the 2024 election.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/multimedia/27met-ny-redistricting-fhlq/27met-ny-redistricting-fhlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:03:21.484447

Sullivan v. Feldman, 132 F.4th 315, 332 (5th Cir.","Despite its promise, arbitration is not always cheaper and faster than litigation, especially when class arbitration is involved. In Sullivan v. Feldman, the Fifth Circuit encountered what it called ""the Bleak House of arbitration.""1 The case involved nine overlapping proceedings over five years before nine different arbitrators, leading to four inconsistent awards.2 There was even an attempt, after the appeal was filed, to initiate a tenth arbitration.3 Two of the awards reached different results on class arbitration: one allowed class arbitration, while the other did not.4 Constrained by the parties' arbitration agreement and broad delegation clause, the court affirmed the confirmation of all four awards.5On March 11, the Fifth Circuit ordered the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, on remand, to stay the litigation while the parties initiate an eleventh arbitration to reconcile the conflicting awards.6

Sullivan is part of a larger split, percolating through the circuit courts, on whether incorporation of the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) into an arbitration agreement means that the parties intended to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator. In its March ruling, the Fifth Circuit panel ""reluctantly"" concluded that the issue was delegated to the arbitrators under circuit precedent, and affirmed the contrary awards.7On June 25, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants an extension of time to August 28 to file a petition for certiorari on this issue.8 As of this writing, the defendants have not filed any petition for certiorari. The litigation in the district court is currently stayed, per a June 24 order.9 On September 12, the defendants filed notice of yet another appeal to the Fifth Circuit.10

Sullivan also stands as a reminder that broad delegations of power to arbitrators may prevent courts from correcting even serious errors when arbitrators go astray. Here, the parties' arbitration agreement provided for arbitration before a ""single"" arbitrator, to be resolved within four months. Nevertheless, the case has been going on for five years and as of this writing is now before its eleventh arbitrator.11

Background

Doctors Scott Sullivan and Frank Dellacroce, owners of various medical entities in New Orleans, engaged Stewart Feldman and his law firm to help ""mitigate financial risk and save taxes.""12 The investment plan ""fell apart"" after the doctors learned that the U.S. Tax Court had deemed a risk pool in the arrangement not to be a ""bona fide insurance company.""13 The ensuing dispute led to nine separate, overlapping arbitrations, culminating in a single hearing before the ""final four"" arbitrators.14 The hearing, held at a five-star resort, cost over $300,000 in room fees alone, and resulted in four wildly different awards, reaching conflicting conclusions on the ""hotly disputed"" issue of class certification and the personal liability of Jeff Carlson, president of one of the Capstone entities.15 The amounts of the conflicting awards ranged from about $1 million to about $88 million.16

The district court entered a judgment ""embodying all four awards in their riotously varying glory.""17 The defendants appealed.18

The Reluctant Affirmance of Class Arbitrability

The panel ""reluctantly"" followed precedent holding that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrators.19 The parties' agreement incorporated the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, which themselves incorporate the Supplementary Rules.20 One of the Supplementary Rules provides: ""[T]he arbitrator shall determine . . . whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.""21

Circuit courts are split on the effect of incorporation of the AAA Rules into an arbitration agreement: the Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator, but the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held it does not.22 The court acknowledged that its own precedent was ""questionable"" in light of the Supreme Court's admonishment inLamps Plus, Inc. v.Varelathat ''[l]ike silence, ambiguity does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties"" agreed to delegate class arbitrability.23 Nevertheless, the court affirmed the award.

Prior toSullivan, three Fifth Circuit cases had charted a ""middle path"" between the two options.24 In 2012, the court held inPetrofac v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., ""that the express adoption of [the AAA] rules presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.""25 But in 2019, the court decided 20/20 Communications, Inc. v. Crawford.26 In that case, the court considered a class arbitration bar which provided that the arbitrator ""does not have the authority to fashion a proceeding gas class or collective action.""27 The court concluded that the incorporation of the AAA Rules did not clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator when ""compare[d]"" with the class arbitration bar.28 But as one observer has pointed out, ""the only way you get to the conclusion that the parties prohibited class proceedings is to read and interpret the contract,"" and ""the delegation provision should send all contract interpretation issues to the arbitrator.""29 Consequently,20/20 Communications""amounts to an elevation of the issue of class arbitrability.""30 In other words, in some cases, the incorporation of the AAA Rules may clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator, and in other cases, it may not.

A 2024 Fifth Circuit case complicated the issue even further, because it is in tension with 20/20 Communications. In Work v. Intertek Resource Solutions, Inc., the court held that incorporation of the JAMS Rules clearly and unmistakably delegates class arbitrability.31 But the JAMS Rules at issue, unlike the AAA Rules, donotspecifically mention class arbitrability. Rather, they state only that ""[j]urisdictional and arbitrability disputes . . . shall be submitted to and ruled on by the Arbitrator.""32 The Sullivan court thus described Work as an ""outlier"" in that ""[n]o other circuit court has held that a rule generally delegating arbitrability questions carries with it a delegation of class arbitrability.""33 The Fifth Circuit declined to rehearSullivanen banc to resolve this tension.34

The tension between these cases derives from developing Supreme Court precedent over the past three decades concerning delegation of arbitrability and its relationship to class arbitrability. In First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, the Supreme Court unanimously held in 1995 that ""[c]ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is 'clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]' evidence that they did so.""35 This case thus established the rule for delegation of arbitrability issues in general.

Five years later, inStolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., the Court expressed some skepticism towards class arbitration, holding that an arbitration agreement that was ""silent"" as to class arbitration did not allow for it.36 In a 5-3 decision by Justice Alito, the Court reasoned that ""class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.""37 The ""differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration"" were ""too great for arbitrators to presume . . . that the parties' mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.""38

In the 2013, the Supreme Court considered the interaction between class arbitration and delegation in Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter.39 In that case, the Court unanimously held that an arbitrator may determine class arbitrability when ""[t]he parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration.""40 This case thus ""seemingly took a step back fromStolt-Nielsen"" and its skepticism towards class arbitration.41 The Court held that an arbitrator's decision on the issue was controlling ""as long as the arbitrator '(even arguably) interpreted the contract.'""42

But in 2019, the Court expressed renewed skepticism towards class arbitration in Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela.43 There, the Court held 5-4 that ""[c]ourts may not infer from an ambiguous agreement that parties have consented to arbitrate on a classwide basis.""44 Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion, and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan wrote four dissents. Since then, Justices Barrett and Jackson have replaced Justices Breyer and Ginsburg on the Court.

The interaction of this line of Supreme Court cases has worked itself out in the Circuit Courts to produce the circuit split described above. Based on this history, some commentators have suggested that the Supreme Court is likely to rule that ""incorporation of the AAA rules is not 'clear and unmistakable' enough to delegate"" to the arbitrator the authority to decide class arbitrability.45

The Multiple Arbitrators and the Four-Month Deadline

Apart from the class arbitrability issue, the parties' arbitration agreement contained provisions that ""encouraged, or at least permitted, a veritable parade of arbitrations.""46 One provision gave the arbitrator the ""thesole and exclusive abilityto rule on all aspects of the arbitrator's appointment.''47 Another provided that ""either party may directly appoint the single arbitrator"" who ""shall proceed to resolve the dispute.''48 The arbitrators construed the ""single arbitrator"" provision to mean that ""multiple arbitrations could proceed simultaneously"" because each arbitration was a different ""dispute.""49 The parties' agreement did not allow the court to ""second-guess"" the arbitrators' decision, ""as long as the arbitrator's decision 'draws its essence' from the contract—even if [the court] disagree[s] with the arbitrator's interpretation.''50 Therefore, under the parties' agreement, the court was bound to defer to the arbitrators.51

Other provisions, too, contributed to the Bleak House ""parade."" The agreement stated: ""[T]he arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes and challenges to the formation and enforceability of this"" agreement.52 If the arbitrator did not complete the arbitration within four months, ""any party then may file another written demand for arbitration . . . with another"" arbitrator.53 The final four arbitrators all agreed that this deadline was ""unenforceable as unconscionable.""54 The court refused to review this determination, following the parties' agreement.55 Under Supreme Court precedent, ''[t]he sole question for [this court] is whether the arbitrator[s] (even arguably) interpreted the parties' contract, not whether [they] got its meaning right or wrong.''56 The court therefore declined to ""upend"" the arbitrators' unconscionability finding.57

The clause delegating enforceability questions thus backfired here against the drafter in a way similar to the AAA Rule delegating questions of arbitrability, including class arbitrability. At least one scholar has suggested that the law should ""distinguish[] between agreements to arbitrate a complaint and agreements to arbitrate the enforceability or scope of an arbitration provision"" by treating delegation clauses ""like weaker cousins of agreements to arbitrate the merits: terms that are presumptively valid but also laden with commonsense exceptions.""58 Although such concerns have usually been expressed in the consumer and employment arbitration contexts, this case shows that even sophisticated parties like the law firm in Sullivan may find there is a drawback to such broad delegations of authority.

Conclusion

This case illustrates complications arising from the circuit split over whether incorporation of the AAA Rules serves to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator—or in this case, arbitrators. Although the arbitrators reached opposite conclusions on this issue, the court was bound by precedent not to second-guess them.

This case also stands as a reminder to those who draft arbitration agreements of what can go wrong when parties delegate to arbitrators issues which will thereafter be unreviewable by courts. The parties' agreement stated that arbitration must take place before a ""single arbitrator"" over ""four months,"" but the arbitration took place before eleven arbitrators over five years.

Those drafting arbitration agreements ought to weigh carefully the pros and cons of extensive delegation of authority to arbitrators. Depending on the circuit, they should consider whether they want class arbitrability, in particular, to be decided by the arbitrators or by the courts.

All five were accused of allegedly assisting in the gambling operation and booked into the Ada County Jail.
On Monday, families rushed to Elmore County Jail, where the ACLU of Idaho found many detainees were being held.
Protesters gathered at the Canyon County Administration Building, demanding answers about why more than 100 people were detained when the operation targeted five people allegedly involved in illegal gambling.
Donations continued pouring into the ACLU to help families stock up on food and essentials, especially for children left without their parents.","WILDER, Idaho — A week after federal agents raided a horse racing arena in Wilder, families remain separated, and questions linger about how an investigation into illegal gambling resulted in more than 100 people being detained by immigration authorities.

The Oct. 19 operation at La Catedral Arena began as a quiet race day before more than 200 federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the venue around 2 p.m.

Officers zip-tied attendees' wrists and moved them to a holding area inside the arena. People with documentation were eventually released, while 105 undocumented individuals were loaded into vans and transported to facilities in Boise and Mountain Home.

""My wrists were ziptied so tight until I couldn't move anymore,"" Sujei Teo said. ""We were all just in like a big bunch. A big bunch of people we just wanted to get out of there.""

Five people were arrested in connection with an alleged illegal gambling operation: Ivan Tellez, the owner of La Catedral; Samuel Bejarano; Dayana Fajardo; Alejandro Estrada; and Cesar Orozco. All five were accused of allegedly assisting in the gambling operation and booked into the Ada County Jail.

The FBI stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations division ""was present as part of the broader federal team to process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation."" The agency said ICE's presence was separate from the criminal gambling investigation.

On Monday, families rushed to Elmore County Jail, where the ACLU of Idaho found many detainees were being held. Others returned to La Catedral to retrieve the vehicles of those who had been taken.

""I've only slept like two hours. It's been so tough,"" one family member said.

Protesters gathered at the Canyon County Administration Building, demanding answers about why more than 100 people were detained when the operation targeted five people allegedly involved in illegal gambling.

""They cannot do this to our kids,"" one protester said. ""Our kids deserve to be at school.""

By Tuesday, Tellez appeared in federal court in Boise and was released on conditions. Bejarano appeared but was not released due to his past criminal history. Estrada appeared and was released. Fajardo did not appear due to a transport issue. Orozco appeared on Wednesday and was released.

""He's a legal permanent resident. These allegations are very much out of character for Mr. Orozco,"" Max Williams, Orozco's attorney, said.

Attorneys said the 105 detainees were split up and taken to facilities in Utah, Rigby and Burley. Immigration attorneys meeting with affected families began questioning the FBI's handling of the operation.

""I think this could have been handled better,"" Nikki Ramirez said. ""If they were going to detain people for illegal activity, they could have just detained them. Why did everyone need to be questioned about their citizenship? That was irrelevant to the case they were investigating.""

On Thursday, Canyon County officials spoke publicly for the first time since the raid. Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said he needed to clarify statements made by the Department of Homeland Security.

""Unfortunately, when people like the federal government, specifically DHS or Homeland Security, ICE comes into our community and they do these types of polarizing operations, we're left with the aftermath,"" Ingram said. ""A lot of those relationships since Sunday have been broken. The trust has been broken. So I feel like as a leader, it's my job to really engage with a community that feels that there's a divide right now.""

On Saturday, community members gathered to show support for families missing loved ones. Donations continued pouring into the ACLU to help families stock up on food and essentials, especially for children left without their parents.

""We need everybody. All of us,"" one Nampa resident said. ""We can't just stay by ourselves and make it. We need to join up and help each other.""",https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841/20251027T040709/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:03:01.577798

In President Trump’s anti-immigration blitz, federal agents have repeatedly violated civil liberties and humiliated people.
As is typical for Mr. Trump, he has identified a real problem — illegal immigration — but responded with a destructive solution.
For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos.
As if to prove the protesters’ point, federal agents have reacted with more abuses of power, using tear gas and pepper balls on peaceful demonstrators.","The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration has become a campaign of discrimination against Latinos. Federal agents are rounding up people with brown skin, catching both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants in their dragnet. Some Latinos are now afraid to speak Spanish or listen to Spanish music in public. Some are missing Mass and staying home on Sundays, or asking friends to pick up their children from school. American citizens are living in fear of a government that is sworn to protect their liberties and keep them safe.

They have reason to fear. In President Trump’s anti-immigration blitz, federal agents have repeatedly violated civil liberties and humiliated people. Masked officials have shattered car windows and pulled out drivers, leaving children sobbing in back seats. In the middle of the night in Chicago, agents with rifles swarmed an apartment building, broke down doors and dragged people from their homes in handcuffs. Dozens of those taken away were U.S. citizens. Nationwide, immigration officials have detained more than 170 American citizens, including 20 held for more than 24 hours without the ability to make a phone call, ProPublica reported.

These actions are undermining the public trust that is necessary for effective enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. The behavior of federal agents is provoking an angry backlash in many of the communities that Mr. Trump claims he is trying to help. If all of this is supposed to convey a sense of renewed law and order, it is not working.

As is typical for Mr. Trump, he has identified a real problem — illegal immigration — but responded with a destructive solution. For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos. The Biden administration’s porous policies worsened the situation, making possible the largest immigration surge in American history, with most of the arrivals lacking legal permission to enter the country. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to reverse those policies, and he has an electoral mandate to do so. At the border, he has succeeded at reducing illegal entries to the lowest levels in decades.

Yet he does not have a mandate to treat people cruelly or to break the law himself. Polls show that most Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue. The country does not need to choose between the chaos of the Biden approach and the chaos of the Trump approach. The best solution remains a comprehensive law that secures the border, deters future illegal entries, expands legal immigration and provides a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized migrants who have made their lives in the United States and are otherwise law-abiding members of society. Short of that — and Congress shows no signs of passing such a law — Mr. Trump can address illegal immigration in ways that are both more humane and effective. This country needs to enforce its laws without terrorizing innocent Americans and abandoning its values.

Of the many problems with Trump immigration policies, two themes stand out: the brutality toward immigrants who are here illegally and the unfairness toward citizens and legal immigrants.

People who entered this country illegally often did so at great risk to themselves, seeking a better life in the United States. They violated the law, yes, but the response should be proportional to their crimes. It should be both firm and humane. Instead, the Trump administration has reveled in harshness. Masked, plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have tackled and body slammed people on the streets. Officials have launched raids into homes, destroying people’s property.

In one video, a federal agent said to a group of Latinos, including a U.S. citizen: “You got no rights here. You’re an amigo, brother.” After that encounter, one agent told another, referring to the immigrants, “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” In another video, an agent yelled “adios” to the concerned wife of a detained migrant before he shoved her into a wall and she collapsed. Other disturbing videos have filled social media.

The tactics violate both the law and human decency. On the legal side, recent court decisions have emphasized that people accused of being here without permission have a constitutional right to some due process. That right is to all of our benefit: If the federal government could simply say that someone is in the country illegally without having to prove the claim, it could deport anyone with impunity. On the human side, a vast majority of these migrants have done nothing worse than come to the country illegally, in search of a better life. Federal agents should respond appropriately, not with the expectation that violence is necessary.

The second problem with the Trump approach is that its breadth inevitably sweeps up U.S. citizens and other legal residents. Federal officials are relying on racial profiling in a country where 20 percent of the population is Latino, most of whom are legal residents or citizens. The administration is able to do so because of Congress’s acquiescence on the topic and a wrongheaded ruling that the Supreme Court issued last month, upholding the use of racial profiling in the raids.

The use of racial discrimination in law enforcement should be an affront to all Americans. Videos show that many federal agents believe that the burden of proof is on Latinos to show they are here legally, not on the government officials who are accusing them of a crime. During a raid in California, officials yanked George Retes, a U.S. citizen who served in Iraq, from his car and held him for three days. Mr. Retes said he had a government ID in his vehicle, but officials did not let him show it to them. Similar treatment befell Javier Ramirez in California, Julio Noriega in Illinois and an unnamed military veteran in New Jersey, among others.

Americans have responded to these problems with protests. As if to prove the protesters’ point, federal agents have reacted with more abuses of power, using tear gas and pepper balls on peaceful demonstrators. Even after a federal judge demanded an end to these practices, they have continued.

Federal agents’ masks exacerbate the problems. Agents with masks know they are more likely to get away with violence and abuses of power because they are anonymous. To the community, masks signal that the government cares more about protecting its agents’ identities than democratic accountability. They create a sense that the government is sending faceless storm troopers to terrorize families.

Despite its aggressiveness, the crackdown has not even been effective at dealing with the millions of people who are in this country without legal permission. The administration is missing its own deportation benchmarks. It is on pace to deport fewer people than the Obama administration did in some years. The Obama administration’s approach made sense. It focused on people who arrived recently and on those who had committed crimes since arriving in this country — and it typically respected people’s rights to due process. It did not resort to masked agents and violent raids.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/opinion/27immigration-editorial-image/27immigration-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:03:59.534559

The administration’s latest move has been revising the naturalization test, making it harder, and perhaps impossible, for the most perceptive immigrants to become citizens.

In the past, aspiring citizens had to answer at least six of 10 questions correctly, in an oral examination drawn from a pool of 100. As of last week, however, new applicants will be given 20 questions, from a pool of 128, with a passing score of 12.

According to the director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the old test was “just too easy.” As explained by a spokesperson, the new test, in conjunction with “neighborhood investigations,” will weed out those who are not “fully assimilated” and cannot “contribute to America’s greatness.”

If the test accomplishes anything, it likely will subtly favor Trump-friendly immigrants, and disfavor MAGA skeptics.

In theory, tougher new questions have replaced softballs about geography or holidays, which had short, obvious answers. Thus, two questions about the oceans bordering the U.S. have been removed, superseded by supposedly more demanding ones.

That claim is belied by the recommended answers in the new USCIS study guide, which provides equally short, easily memorized answers to seemingly complex questions.

Question 111 asks “Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?” The sole approved answer is, “To stop the spread of communism.”

Anyone who attempted to provide a nuanced or historically comprehensive answer — say, about geopolitical rivalry or control of resources — would risk being marked wrong, and perhaps branded an unassimilated threat to American greatness.

In an oral examination with open-ended questions, the only smart approach is to stick to the answer in the study guide. It isn’t any harder to remember “stop communism” than it is to memorize “Atlantic Ocean.”

Memorization aside, the test presents a profound problem for applicants who have been paying attention to the news. The approved answers plainly contradict the conduct of the Trump administration. For many of the civics questions, honest answers would likely be unacceptable, while the approved answers clash with Trumpian reality.

Question 6, for example, asks “What does the Bill of Rights protect?” The answer, which would have been accurate before Jan. 20, is “The basic rights of people living in the United States,” with no mention of citizenship or immigration status.

The Trump administration, however, has seized people “living in the United States” without warrants, and shipped them to a notorious prison in El Salvador without any semblance of due process required by the Fifth Amendment.

Citizens and non-citizens alike, including children, have found themselves detained, roughed up and zip-tied in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on arbitrary search and seizure. Nor has the First Amendment protected international students whose visas have been revoked because they disagree with U.S. foreign policy.

Question 15 asks why there are “three branches of government.” The given answer is “So one part does not become too powerful.”

Trump, of course, has asserted virtually unlimited power under the “unitary executive” theory, including an assertedly unreviewable power to order armed troops into U.S. cities, over the objections of state governors, under the pretext of “insurrection” or “rebellion.”

He also ordered the demolition of the East Wing of the White House without first consulting the National Capital Planning Commission. The list goes on.

Likewise, Question 18 asks “What part of the federal government writes laws?” The answer is “Congress.” And Question 20 asks to “Name one power of the U.S. Congress?” “Making the federal budget” is an approved answer.”

Trump has set about governing by executive order, including the unilateral imposition of tariffs, which is a power specifically given to Congress under Article I of the Constitution. He has often ignored congressional budget legislation, repeatedly disregarding the Impoundment Control Act by freezing or withholding previously authorized appropriations, grants and even disaster relief funds.

Perhaps the new test is intended as a teaching vehicle by including the ostensible reasons for the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars — communism, communism, and freeing Kuwait. There is no question about the Iraq War, perhaps because an answer about false intelligence reports wouldn’t “contribute to America’s greatness.”

In any case, the test has a decidedly right-wing tilt, with four questions or answers about the Federalist Papers, and two suggesting Trump’s preferred version of birthright citizenship.

Most Asian immigrants were ineligible for naturalization until 1952, under racist insistence that they could not be assimilated into American society. Over 70 years later, USCIS has revived the same rationale for denying naturalizations.

Question 124 asks for the meaning of the national motto “E Pluribus Unum.” The answer, “out of many, one,” is accurate for the time being. Under Trump, it may soon be changed to, “out of many, only the right ones.”

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East.
According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.
Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.
Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.","British commentator Sami Hamdi was detained on Sunday by federal immigration officers during a speaking tour in the United States, in what a Muslim advocacy group said was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

The Trump administration said its decision to detain Hamdi and revoke his visa underscores that the US has no obligation to host foreigners “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has called Hamdi’s treatment a “blatant affront to free speech” and called for his release.

Here’s what we know.

Who is Hamdi?

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East. Recently, he has spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and international plans for the post-war governance of the enclave.

Based in London, Hamdi also writes about UK foreign policy and domestic politics. According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.

He is also editor-in-chief of International Interest, a political risk consultancy in London.

When was he detained?

Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.

On Saturday, Hamdi had spoken at CAIR’s annual gala in Sacramento, California, and had been due to speak at the gala of CAIR Florida the next day.

CAIR said its lawyers were “working to address this injustice.” and called on ICE to release him.

“Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,” CAIR said.

Israel’s war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 68,000 people and reduced much of the enclave to rubble. Israel says its offensive has targeted Hamas and that it takes measures to avoid killing civilians, but a United Nations inquiry last month concluded for the first time that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.

Why now?

Laura Loomer, a conservative activist with a direct line to Trump, said Hamdi’s arrest came after her “relentless pressure” on the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a series of posts on X, she claimed Hamdi was “an individual with Islamic terror ties” and a supporter of Hamas.

The State Department confirmed it had arrested Hamdi, saying the US will continue to revoke the visas of foreigners who “support terrorism” and make Americans unsafe. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the approach showed common sense.

Loomer called on the Trump administration to take further action against CAIR by revoking its 501(c)(3) status, which makes the nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxes.

CAIR said Loomer, who has taken credit for a slew of high-profile firings in the Trump administration, was an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Loomer has previously described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said Muslims should not be allowed to seek political office in the US.

What are the legal issues?

Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.

In October, Mario Guevara – a Salvadoran journalist who documented immigration raids – was deported to El Salvador after spending months in federal custody. He was arrested in June while covering an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest against what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.

Legal experts and judges have voiced concern over the legal basis for such detentions. In September, William Young – a federal judge appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan – issued an extraordinary 161-page rebuke of the Trump administration, saying its efforts to deport non-citizen activists represented a “full-throated assault on the First Amendment.”

Young’s ruling is expected to be appealed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2187203810.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-27 13:03:05.531001

The salient points include the provisions that any H-1B petitions that are approved for an extension of stay, amendment or change of status – including change of employer petitions -will not be subject to the Presidential Proclamation or the associated $100,000.00 filing fee.

Additional Key Provisions:

USCIS also indicated that foreign nationals located within the United States with approved H1B petitions will not be subject to the proclamation or associated $100,000 fee if they depart the United States. A departure from the USA by a foreign national while an H-1B petition is pending will trigger the H-1B visa fee.

H-1B petitions filed with consular notifications after the effective date of September 21st, 2025, will be subject to the $100,000 fee regardless of whether the foreign national was in the United States at the time of the H-1B filing, apart from certain foreign nationals who hold current H-1B status.

Filing for Exceptions:

To qualify for a national interest exception, USCIS regulations mandate a high level and threshold mandating that the U.S. employer is unable to locate a qualified U.S. worker available for the role and contrary to the Proclamation itself, USCIS does not permit exceptions on a company-wide or industry-wide basis.

Eligibility for national interest exceptions would be granted only in ‘exceptionally rare’ circumstances where the following criteria may be met:

The foreign national’s presence in the United States is in the interest of the national interest of the United States;

No American worker is available to assume the position offered;

The foreign national does not pose a security threat to the United States;

Payment of the $100,000 fee by a U.S. employer would significantly undermine the national interest of the United States.

Considerations:

Travel Outside the United States after petition approval –If a foreign national employee departs the United States after the petition is approved, they will not become subject to the $100,000.00 fee because of their departure.

Denied H-1B petitions – The online form created to facilitate payment of the $100,000 fee indicates that if the H-1B petition is denied, the fee will be refunded.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said.
Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.
“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said.
Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.","An executive order signed by President Donald Trump last month has left business immigration attorneys scrambling to understand its potential fallout and impact on their clients.

On Sept. 19, Trump signed the “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” proclamation, mandating a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions filed beginning on Sept. 21.

The H-1B visas allow employers to hire foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require four-year college degrees, such as technology, engineering and medicine, on a temporary basis.

Charlottesville attorney Jennifer Minear, director of McCandlish Holton’s immigration practice group, said her inbox “exploded with inquiries about the proclamation” in the days following the announcement.

“To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement,” Minear said.

Henrico attorney Dustin Dyer, whose firm solely focuses on immigration law, said the proclamation could have impacts beyond the ultimate goal of the order.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said. “While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.”

Ultimately, attorneys in the business immigration space have cautioned that advice to clients remains subject to change as the situation develops, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services providing updates as recently as Oct. 20 on the proclamation, clarifying who is subject to the fee and exemptions.

“Because clients simply do not know whether this fee will apply, and because they know they can’t pay the fee if it does apply, I am already seeing multiple clients question whether they should proceed with job offers to those seeking H-1B status,” Minear said.

Proclamation

Per the executive order, the $100,000 fee for new H-1B applicants went into effect on Sept. 21 and would remain effective for one year, with the goal to target alleged “abuse” of the visa system by some employers.

The order cites statistics showing a growing percentage of foreign workforce share in areas such as computers and math, which the White House claimed “has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers.”

To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement.

— Jennifer Minear, Charlottesville

Left unanswered in the proclamation was who would be on the hook for the $100,000 fee and which specific applicants are exempt from the fee.

“The proclamation was, to put it generously, poorly drafted and missing a lot of important information necessary to understand its scope and meaning,” Minear said.

On Oct. 20, USCIS issued guidance related to the $100,000 proclamation, clarifying that the fee does not apply to “an alien inside the United States” requesting an amendment, change or status or extension of stay, and that current H-1B visa holders are not prevented from traveling in and out of the country.

USCIS further stated that the secretary of Homeland Security can grant exemption to the $100,000 payment “in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest” and that no American worker can fill that role.

Notably, the updated guidance includes the terms “extraordinarily rare” and “high threshold,” terms absent from the initial executive order.

Minear said that the “national interest” exemption “is narrowed considerably” by the USCIS language.

“I am extremely skeptical that anyone will be approved for an exemption based on the process and criteria described,” Minear said.

USCIS also provided a pay.gov link through which “petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment” and clarified that petitioners must make payment prior to filing with USCIS.

Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.

While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.

— Dustin Dyer, Henrico

Minear said her clients, many of whom are in the health care or education industries, are seeking guidance on next steps regarding the fee.

“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said. “My clients sure can’t.”

The updated guidance by USCIS comes as two federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the executive order.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Oct. 16, arguing that Congress has the authority over H-1B visas and that the $100,000 fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses.

Some two weeks earlier, a diverse group of plaintiffs representing multiple industries filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, providing similar arguments and claiming harms to health care and education employers.

Due to the pending federal suits, Minear cautioned that it is “exceedingly difficult to advise clients in this environment.”

Looking ahead

Dyer anticipated potential economic impacts should the executive order survive scrutiny by the federal courts.

“H-1B professional workers, particularly those in fields like technology, health care and research, play a critical role in driving innovation and filling labor gaps that U.S. workers cannot always address,” Dyer said. “Limiting their entry by imposing an outrageous fee to utilize the H-1B program not only threatens America’s global competitiveness but also undermines businesses and industries that rely on specialized skills.”

Minear said her office receives so many inquiries on the H-1B visa issue that she has created templated email responses to the inquiries.

“There are, of course, no clients who can afford to pay a $100,000 additional fee to use the H-1B program, so if the fee is allowed to stand, it will effectively gut the H-1B visa program,” Minear said.

Dyer noted a possible alternative for long-term success that he theorized would benefit all stakeholders.

“The long-term economic costs far outweigh any perceived short-term benefits, and the U.S. should instead focus on policies that support both domestic workers and the talent we attract from around the world,” Dyer said.

Ultimately, Minear said the situation remains fluid while practitioners await more definitive guidance from the federal government and the resolution of the federal lawsuits.

“Hopefully, we will soon have an injunction from a federal District Court or, at minimum, further guidance from the administration that blunts the catastrophic impact of this proclamation on sectors of the economy that rely heavily on H-1B workers,” she said.

Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.

“The impact on Virginia’s education and health care system is certain to be profoundly negative if the proclamation remains in effect,” she said.",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/Depositphotos_335369082_XL.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:02:10.780367

With this rulemaking, DHS proposes to amend its regulations governing the process by which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) selects H-1B cap-subject petitions (or H-1B petitions for any year in which the registration requirement is suspended). The agency proposed to move away from a purely random lottery selection process to a weighted process to favor the selection of higher-skilled and higher-paid workers.

While CIS believes the DHS proposal will improve the status quo, CIS proposed additional reforms to ensure that the H-1B program fulfills its statutory purpose: to allow U.S. employers to temporarily hire truly high-skilled workers when qualified U.S. workers are unavailable — without displacing or undercutting American labor.

Replacing the purely random selection process with one that prioritizes higher wages and higher skill levels will help restore the program’s original intent, discourage abuse, and protect both U.S. and foreign workers from unfair labor practices. In tandem, CIS requested that DHS amend its regulations to only provide cap exemption eligibility for workers who are directly employed by a qualifying employer, reinstate USCIS’s itinerary requirement, repeal USCIS’s deference policy, tighten the “specialty occupation” definition, and work with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to raise wage rates to close known loopholes and enhance oversight.

Taken together, these changes would make the H-1B program more transparent, merit-based, and consistent with the letter and spirit of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that a volunteer in her office spent the last several months creating AGUAS-NM.com in response to widespread—but hard-to-verify—reports of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting people across the state.

“Our community is held to the rule of law, so why shouldn’t law enforcement…be documented in hopes that they will follow the law as well?” she told Source on Thursday in a phone interview. “It was born of frustration and hope that when we shine a little bit of light that hopefully transparency wins.”

The website greets visitors with a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of individual arrest reports, and it warns that the website should not be used to interfere with law enforcement operations, which Anaya also stressed in the interview.

Users can anonymously submit photos, videos or summaries of potential ICE arrests to the website, which will then appear on the map as “unverified” until representatives of community groups visit the site in person and talk to witnesses, Anaya said.

Adding a layer of verification should help instill trust in the website while also aiming to stop the spread of misinformation, she said.

“Often people will think that a private security guard is ICE when really they may not be,” she said. “And I think that’s why we’re focusing so heavily on making sure that we have validated and unvalidated check marks.”

Spokespersons for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, two immigrant advocacy organizations, declined to comment Friday on the new website.

Data about how many ICE arrests have occurred in New Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push is hard to come by, though national data suggests arrests are increasing. The number of people ICE has detained in the state’s three detention centers has steadily increased, as well.

“When it comes to other areas of the state, clearly, that’ll work a little bit differently,” she said. “But for us, it’s more about transparency.

I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he told Guardian Australia through his lawyer.
Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation.
Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade.
Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.","Adnan* says he had never heard of Nauru when Australian Border Force officers showed up at his door in the middle of the night to inform him Nauru had granted him a 30-year visa.

Initially believing Nauru was part of Australia, Adnan felt a brief sense of relief before he realised he was being sent back to a place he had become uncomfortably familiar with – immigration detention.

“I thought there had been a mistake. I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he told Guardian Australia through his lawyer.

“I have been in detention since, trying to figure out how all of this happened to me, and why I have been selected for this punishment.”

The man, whose real name Guardian Australia is not using to reduce the risk of reprisal, is one of more than 350 people within the so-called NZYQ cohort, which the federal government has promised to deport to the tiny Pacific island in a $2.5bn deal.

In 2023, the high court ruled the government’s policy of indefinitely locking up non-citizens who cannot be deported to another country was unconstitutional. The judgment paved the way for the group’s release.

It’s a cohort consisting of many different stories. Some – including Adnan – have had their visas cancelled on character grounds after being convicted of crimes and sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. Others have been refused a visa but cannot be deported because they are refugees or stateless.

A number of people within the group have since been subject to strict monitoring conditions, including ankle monitors, as part of tough restrictions to ensure community safety.

A deal struck with Nauru in February means authorities can apply for long-term visas on behalf of people within the NZYQ cohort without their knowledge. Once Nauru grants the visa, Australian authorities can re-detain the visa holder in an immigration detention centre until they are sent to the island.

The government swiftly passed laws in September stripping non-citizens on removal pathways of natural justice – a legal principle affording everyone access to a fair hearing and to a decision without bias.

The changes aim to speed up deportations by removing the cohort’s right to taking further legal challenges that might delay their deportation.

In recent months, authorities have been conducting night-time and dawn raids on those within the cohort who have been granted a 30-year visa for Nauru – an island home to just 12,000 people and with limited physical and mental health services.

Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation. Many more are believed to have been re-detained but with the government refusing to release any details, human rights groups are left to investigate who is suddenly missing from the community.

Adnan says it feels as if he is “living in a nightmare”.

Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade. Adnan could not leave the country or bring his family to Australia prior to his conviction because he had been placed on temporary protection visas.

Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.

“These days are like living in a nightmare. I made mistakes since I came to Australia – I have been punished for those mistakes. I have tried everything to put my life back on track. I am not a young man – I cannot keep rebuilding my life. I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment,” he says.

The deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, Jana Favero, says Australia’s treatment of noncitizens with criminal convictions is divisive and unfair.

“If two people commit the same crime, but only one faces exile to a remote island penal colony after they’ve done their time, that’s not justice – it’s divisive and sends a message to people without citizenship that they will never be equal,” she says.

Details about the criminal histories of the people within the NZYQ cohort are scant but the home affairs department in March said 13 had been convicted for murder or attempted murder.

About 95 have had a criminal history of sex-based offending and 133 have been previously convicted of assault, violent offending, kidnapping or armed robbery. At least nine have been found guilty of low-level crimes or have no criminal history. All were detained after serving their sentences.

Favero says border force’s unannounced night-time visits to people mirrored controversial intimidation tactics by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“What we’ve seen with ICE in the US is now becoming reality here – and families will be torn apart, with devastating, lifelong consequences,” she says.

“This kind of alarming behaviour by border force officials is copying the worst of tactics from Trump and ICE, turning up unannounced and intimidating people, and in some cases detaining them, simply because of where they were born.”

The Human Rights Law Centre’s legal director, Sanmati Verma, told Guardian Australia the government is ignoring the “brutal reality” of its actions.

“Under the cover of secrecy, the Australian government is pulling people out of the community, locking them in detention, and smuggling them out of the country,” she says.

“No matter where we are from, or what visa we hold, there is a common dignity that binds our communities together. We should not accept our government inflicting lifelong punishment on migrants and refugees, simply because of their visa status.”

A home affairs department spokesperson says it does not comment on operational matters but is “committed to maintaining a migration system that is robust, effective and in the national interest”.

“A memorandum of understanding between Australia and the Republic of Nauru signed on 29 August 2025 enables Australia to effect the removal of individuals who have no legal right to remain in Australia and cannot be returned to a country of which they hold citizenship,” the spokesperson says.

Travis County v. ICE Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.
Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.","ICE agents are seizing more people from jails in the Austin area, county officials tell The Texas Newsroom, sometimes visiting the facilities multiple times per day as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide.

“For inmates in our care and custody, they usually wait 24 hours or less because we get pickups from [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] almost every day,” Kristen Dark, Public Information Officer of the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview this month.

She added: “Sometimes they do pick up from us twice a day.”

Aggressive immigration sweeps and arrests have become a hallmark of Trump-era immigration policy. Cities in blue states like California and Illinois have seen the most public crackdowns, including the deployment of federal troops. But, in Texas, where local leaders are compelled to hand people arrested on other charges over ICE directly from county jails, many immigration arrests remain hidden from public view.

The Texas Newsroom filed records requests and spoke to immigrants’ advocates and law enforcement officials to get a clearer picture of how immigration enforcement has changed here under Donald Trump’s second term.

The findings reveal that a growing number of people in Travis County find themselves facing deportation after sometimes routine run-ins with the police.

The jump in the number of people in the county jail identified for ICE arrest coincides with similar increases in other Texas counties, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.

Dark says the local increase can largely be attributed to a growing jail population. Others point to Trump administration policies that have swept a growing number of people into ICE custody and deportation proceedings.

Some local law enforcement officials, like Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, worry the current administration’s aggressive policies could further interfere with their efforts to build healthier connections with immigrant communities. Hernandez is one of several law enforcement officials in Texas who have been reluctant to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Despite these concerns, even more people will likely face deportation after entering the jail system under a new state law taking effect next year.

“Hernandez always says, we want people to run to us, not away from us,” Dark said. “If someone is a victim of crime, we don't want them to be afraid to talk to us. We want to hear from them.”

The state’s top Republican politicians, like Gov. Greg Abbott, have voiced strong support for policies that compel local officials to enforce federal immigration rules.

""Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, Press Secretary for Abbott wrote in response to a request for comment. “Governor Abbott fully supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to deport those who intentionally broke our laws and entered our country illegally.""

Civil rights advocates point out that ICE is, increasingly, detaining people who are in the county legally or are pursuing a path to legal residency.

ICE detainers go up

In Texas, jails will hold someone for an additional 48 hours if a background check reveals the person may be in the country without legal status. This “immigration hold,” which is also called an “ICE detainer,” gives federal agents more time to take them into custody.

People can be arrested and sent to county lockup for reasons as innocuous as driving without a license to far more serious allegations like assault. Until final conviction, they are presumed innocent.

Immigration attorney Iris Albizu believes part of the increase in immigration arrests from county jail is because ICE is detaining more people who are in the process of applying for legal residency.

“What is shocking is that people that are already in the system, people that already have a protected status [...] those people are being detained,” Albizu said.

In response to an open records request, the Travis County Sheriff's office provided The Texas Newsroom with snapshots of the number of people in county jails on the first day of each month for the past several years.

Six out of the nine months this year showed higher numbers of people with ICE detainers as compared to this same period last year. It was the highest in May, when 343 people in Travis County jails were flagged for pickup by ICE. That month, people with ICE detainers accounted for nearly 15% of the local jail population.

But monthly point-in-time numbers only tell part of the story, as some people may be moved from the jail and then to ICE detention before they are counted, and others may stay in jail for months appearing in multiple counts.

Analysts said a better metric is to measure the growth in ICE detainers issued to people booked into jail.

ICE data compiled by the Deportation Data Project, a project run by UCLA and UC Berkeley, shows the number of detainers issued to people booked into local jails was 40% higher in the first six months of this year than during that same period last year.

“It's clear that the Trump administration's priorities around increasing immigration enforcement and mass deportation — they are doing that in Travis County,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, a researcher who studies the use of county jails in immigration enforcement at the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates against mass incarceration.

This uptick cannot be fully explained by an increase in the local jail population. While overcrowding has been an issue in Travis County jails, the rise in detainers issues appears to have outpaced jail population growth.

“Texas has one of the highest rates of ICE arrests, and that's really being driven by the arrests that are happening in the local jails,” Kang-Brown added.

The Texas Newsroom has asked for more detailed data on ICE detainers to provide a fuller picture of local enforcement patterns.

Travis County v. ICE

Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.

Hernandez unsuccessfully fought a 2017 law that mandated that counties hold all inmates flagged with ICE detainers for pickup. Since then, she has complied with the mandate.

But, unlike some other counties, Travis has not partnered with federal or state agencies to enforce immigration policy beyond the detainer system. This affects communication between the agencies, which is already limited.

Dark said neither ICE nor the Texas Department of Public Safety have notified the Travis County Sheriff’s ahead of time when they conduct immigration sweeps or raids.

ICE did not reply to an emailed list of questions from The Texas Newsroom.

But under a new state law passed this year, coordination between ICE and local sheriff’s departments will expand despite this reticence.

The new law, which will go into full effect by the end of next year, will require departments to choose from three different options for how to form deeper partnerships with federal immigration agents.

One will allow counties to create their own immigration task forces, empowered to check people's citizenship status while out on patrol. Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.

""We're looking at all of the models very, very carefully. And we'll be considering the cost and the impact of each before we make our decision,"" said Dark.

No matter what model counties chose, immigrants advocates say the law is sure to increase the already growing number of people who find themselves facing deportation after being detained by local authorities for unrelated reasons.

“That person may be innocent of whatever they’re charged with,” said immigration attorney Iris Albizu, “But, because now they’re caught by immigration, they’re trapped.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0238af0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F80%2F3b374b864fb490236bebd123f39f%2Ftravis-county-correctional-complex-50839314891-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:16:55.094459

Mr. Hamdi is the managing director of the International Interest, an organization that “advises on geopolitical environments and risks across the globe,” according to its website. He has appeared as a commentator on the British television news channel Sky News and other outlets.

He had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. He attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at a gala in Florida on Sunday night.

Mr. Hamdi was detained at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, according to CAIR, which called for his release. Mr. Hamdi is based in London, according to his LinkedIn account.

CAIR said in a statement that Mr. Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his speaking tour. It called the action “a blatant affront to free speech.”

CAIR has long been controversial in Washington, presenting itself as a champion of civil rights for Muslims in an era of Islamophobia yet regularly pilloried by many, especially on the political right, as an apologist for extremism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” Ms. McLaughlin said in the social media post on Sunday.

Earlier this fall, judges rebuked Secretary of State Marco Rubio for taking similar actions against other pro-Palestinian activists. A judge in Massachusetts last month ruled that the Trump administration had used the threat of deportation to systematically silence noncitizens in academia who protested in support of Palestinians. He said the government had violated the First Amendment as part of a broader strategy to stamp out campus activism.

On its X account, the State Department reposted Ms. McLaughlin’s announcement about Mr. Hamdi and added: “We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity.”

In August, the Trump administration said it had paused approvals of visitor visas for people from Gaza, including young children who arrived with serious medical conditions. That move came after an intense lobbying campaign by the right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who called the incoming flights a “national security threat.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/world/27xp-hamdi-1bv/27xp-hamdi-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:16:59.345966

President

Arab American Institute

A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again. Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”

Major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — maintain terms of service prohibiting content from designated terrorist organizations.
International Coordination and Enforcement These domestic effects would be amplified by international coordination that extends the reach of American FTO authorities globally.","Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designations are one of the most powerful legal instruments in America’s counterterrorism arsenal. Originally conceived to combat international terrorist networks like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS), these designations trigger sweeping financial sanctions, severe criminal penalties, and extensive surveillance authorities. President Donald Trump’s comments at a White House roundtable on “Antifa” earlier this month make it likely that his administration will designate this decentralized anti-fascist movement as an FTO — a move that would create an unprecedented expansion of counterterrorism authorities into the domestic political space.

During the roundtable, Trump was asked directly whether he would designate Antifa as an FTO. The president’s response was unambiguous: “I think it’s the kind of thing I’d like to do. If you agree, I agree. Let’s get it done.” This was not casual political rhetoric. It was a directive from the Commander-in-Chief to his national security apparatus, witnessed by millions of Americans. It is also something the first Trump administration took steps toward enacting near the end of the president’s first term in office. (For example, see section 2 of the Executive Order issued on Jan. 5, 2021.) The implications could extend far beyond anti-fascist activists to the entire architecture of American civil society and constitutional governance.

The FTO Framework: Powerful by Design

To understand why an Antifa FTO designation would be so consequential, one must first grasp the extraordinary scope of authorities that such designations unleash. The FTO system was deliberately constructed to maximize governmental power against international terrorist threats. Created by the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the framework provides the executive branch with extraordinary authorities that are designed to dismantle terrorist networks quickly and comprehensively.

Once an organization is designated as an FTO, providing “material support” to it becomes a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, or life if the support results in death. The statutory definition of “material support” is intentionally expansive and includes providing: “currency or monetary instruments, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, personnel, and transportation.” Only medicine and religious materials are explicitly exempted.

The breadth of this definition reflects Congress’s determination to eliminate all forms of assistance to designated organizations. The statute applies to U.S. persons regardless of where the prohibited conduct occurs, creating global reach for American terrorism prosecutions. The Supreme Court’s decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project clarified that even speech intended to promote peaceful conflict resolution may constitute material support if provided to a designated organization.

Financial consequences activate automatically upon designation. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requires all U.S. financial institutions to freeze assets within ten business days and report the frozen funds to the government. This financial disruption is designed to immediately sever designated organizations from the global financial system, preventing them from accessing resources needed for operations.

The Holy Land Foundation case demonstrates the scope of these authorities when applied to charitable organizations. Five charity officials received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years for providing aid to Palestinian communities that prosecutors argued were under the influence of Hamas, a designated FTO. While the defendants maintained they were providing legitimate humanitarian assistance, the court found that the statutory framework criminalized their support regardless of the charitable intent.

Immigration Consequences and the Specter of Denaturalization

Beyond criminal prosecution and financial sanctions, FTO designation triggers severe immigration consequences that could create an underclass of vulnerable individuals subject to expulsion. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, any non-citizen who is a member or representative of a designated FTO is automatically inadmissible to the United States and subject to removal proceedings. The State Department may immediately revoke visas of any foreign nationals deemed to be members, representatives, or supporters of the designated organization. This authority extends to individuals who have “endorsed or espoused terrorist activity” or provided any form of material support, creating an exceptionally broad basis for visa revocation and deportation. (That said, similar provisions for removal of foreign nationals lawfully in the United States are currently being challenged in court on First Amendment grounds.)

The consequences reach even further for naturalized American citizens. Federal law permits denaturalization of individuals who were members of or affiliated with a “terrorist organization” within five years immediately following naturalization. Once Antifa receives FTO designation, any naturalized citizen who attended a counter-protest, donated to a legal defense fund, or expressed support for anti-fascist principles during their first five years as a citizen could face citizenship revocation proceedings.

The recent expansion of denaturalization enforcement, with the Department of Justice announcing in June 2025 that denaturalization cases would become one of its top five enforcement priorities, creates a particularly acute vulnerability for many of the estimated 25 million naturalized Americans. Consider a German immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2023 and maintained connections with anti-fascist groups in her home country, or a French national who was naturalized in 2024 after years of participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right movements in Europe. Both could face potential citizenship revocation and deportation based on activities that were entirely legal when undertaken.

The denaturalization standard requires only “clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence” in civil proceedings — a lower threshold than criminal conviction — and carries no statute of limitations. This creates a permanent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over millions of naturalized Americans whose past political associations could be reinterpreted as terrorism support under an expansive FTO designation.​

Civil Liability Under the Anti-Terrorism Act

The designation of Antifa as an FTO could also potentially expose individuals and organizations to devastating civil liability under the Anti-Terrorism Act (18 U.S.C. § 2333). The ATA authorizes any U.S. national injured “by reason of an act of international terrorism” committed by a designated FTO to sue for treble damages, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), enacted in 2016, expanded this authority to include aiding-and-abetting liability against “any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with” those who commit acts of international terrorism. This creates possible exposure not just for alleged Antifa subjects themselves, but for anyone deemed to have provided material support — including nonprofits, donors, and service providers.

Unlike criminal cases requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, ATA civil cases proceed under the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard, making them easier to win. Even frivolous ATA lawsuits could impose crippling litigation costs — defense firms specializing in terrorism cases charge hundreds of dollars per hour, and cases routinely take years to resolve. The threat of ATA liability could force organizations to obtain expensive specialized insurance (if available at all), conduct exhaustive vetting of all partners and donors, and potentially abandon any activities that could be remotely connected to anti-fascist activism. This civil liability mechanism could thus accomplish through private litigation what criminal prosecution alone might not achieve: the significant curtailment of civil society organizations engaged in political opposition to “anti-fascism,” not through direct government action but through the specter of catastrophic financial liability.

The FISA Surveillance Integration

An FTO designation would also seamlessly integrate Antifa into America’s most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government may conduct electronic surveillance of “agents of foreign powers,” including “groups engaged in international terrorism.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, anyone deemed an “agent” of this “foreign power” becomes eligible for FISA surveillance — including American citizens (though with some stricter standards).

This surveillance integration represents a qualitative escalation beyond traditional criminal investigation. FISA surveillance operates under different standards than domestic criminal investigations. Federal agents need only demonstrate probable cause that “the target of the surveillance is a foreign power or [an] agent of a foreign power” and that “a significant purpose” is obtaining “foreign intelligence information.” The standard does not require demonstration that criminal activity is planned or imminent.

The National Security Agency’s (NSA) authorities under FISA are extensive and largely classified, but publicly available documentation confirms the agency “relies on Title I of FISA to conduct electronic surveillance of foreign powers or their agents, to include members of international terrorist organizations.” These capabilities extend beyond simple wiretapping to include comprehensive electronic monitoring, physical searches, and business records collection.

For American citizens associated with anti-fascist activities, FISA designation could mean potential subjection to the full spectrum of intelligence community surveillance capabilities, all conducted in secret with limited judicial oversight. Unlike criminal investigations, FISA surveillance does not require notification of targets, potentially allowing years of monitoring without the subject’s knowledge.

Social Media Transformation: From Resistance to Compliance

The surveillance implications extend beyond government agencies to encompass the private sector platforms where much contemporary political organization occurs. The impact on digital platforms would be immediate and comprehensive. Major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — maintain terms of service prohibiting content from designated terrorist organizations. Currently, these platforms often resist government information requests about political activists based on First Amendment principles. An FTO designation could eliminate the legal foundation for such resistance.

Facebook’s Community Standards explicitly state that “organizations that are engaged in terrorist activity are not allowed on the platform.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, any content expressing support for anti-fascist principles, sharing protest logistics, or providing resources for activists could become prohibited terrorist content subject to immediate removal. Users posting such content could also face permanent account suspension.

The technological infrastructure already exists for comprehensive content monitoring. Social media companies have developed sophisticated algorithmic systems to identify terrorist content, with Twitter reporting suspension of over 1.5 million accounts for terrorism-related violations between 2015 and 2020, 90 percent identified through automated systems rather than user reports.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) – comprised of YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and Microsoft, and other platforms – maintains shared databases of “digital fingerprints” from known terrorist content. Anti-fascist organizing materials, protest footage, and political commentary could be added to these databases, creating automated, cross-platform content removal and user identification systems.

These changes could extend beyond direct content removal to comprehensive user profiling. The same machine learning systems currently used for content recommendation could begin identifying users based on engagement with anti-fascist content, creating detailed profiles for potential government intelligence gathering. This transformation would convert social media platforms from potential sources of opposition to government overreach into comprehensive surveillance and enforcement networks.

Organizational Vulnerabilities: A Hypothetical Case Study

The abstract legal framework above becomes more concrete when applied to real-world organizational structures. Consider how an FTO designation could impact the “Alliance for Democratic Resistance” (ADR), a fictional but realistic progressive non-governmental organization (NGO), as well as other civil society organizations. ADR operates from a headquarters in Washington, D.C., with regional offices in Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, and Austin. The organization maintains partnerships with civil rights groups in Germany, the U.K., and France, and receives grants from European foundations supporting anti-fascist education programs.

ADR’s activities include organizing counter-protests against white supremacist demonstrations, providing know-your-rights training for protesters, maintaining a legal defense fund for arrested activists, publishing research on far-right movements, and hosting international conferences on combating extremism. These activities, while entirely legal under current law, could become potentially criminal once Antifa is designated as an FTO.

The organization’s international partnerships could be recharacterized as coordination with foreign terrorist entities. Its legal defense fund might constitute material support for domestic terrorists. Research publications could be classified as terrorist propaganda. Training programs might be deemed terrorist instruction.

Within ten business days of designation, OFAC would require ADR’s banks to freeze all accounts and report holdings to the Treasury Department. Staff members would face FBI investigation for potential material support violations. Donors — from major foundations to individual contributors — could become targets for financial crimes prosecution. International partners would be barred from entering the United States.

Beyond criminal charges and asset freezes, ADR could conceivably face civil suits from anyone injured during a protest or counterdemonstration where Antifa was present. A business owner whose property was damaged, a counter-protester who was injured, or even a police officer hurt during a demonstration could sue ADR for treble damages under the ATA, arguing the organization aided and abetted Antifa’s activities by providing meeting space, legal support, or protest coordination. The treble damages provision means a $100,000 injury claim could result in a $300,000 judgment, plus potentially millions in legal fees.

The organization would face immediate operational collapse regardless of whether criminal charges are ultimately filed. Legal defense costs alone could reach millions of dollars. Donors would flee to avoid association with designated “terrorists.” Foundation grants would be suspended pending investigation. Staff would resign to protect themselves from legal jeopardy. Office leases would be terminated, insurance policies cancelled, and nonprofit tax status revoked.

This scenario reflects how FTO designations can destroy organizations through the process itself, independent of successful criminal prosecutions. The mere initiation of terrorism-related investigations creates financial and reputational damage from which most organizations cannot recover.

Cascading Effects Across Civil Society

The destruction of directly targeted organizations represents only the beginning of a possible broader social transformation. The impact could cascade far beyond directly targeted entities, creating a comprehensive chilling effect across the entire progressive political ecosystem. Every progressive nonprofit, civil rights group, and political organization would face immediate compliance assessments. Legal counsel would advise clients to avoid any activities potentially construed as supporting anti-fascist principles. Foundation boards could vote to suspend grants to organizations with possible connections to counter-protest activities.

Academic institutions would face particularly complex challenges. Universities might cancel conferences on combating fascism, restrict faculty research on anti-fascist movements, and suspend student organizations engaged in counter-protest activities. The chilling effect on academic freedom would be profound, as scholars avoid research topics that might create legal jeopardy.

Media organizations may similarly self-censor. Publishers might refuse books on anti-fascist history or strategy. Journalists could avoid reporting on anti-fascist activities to prevent potential material support liability. Documentary filmmakers might cancel projects examining anti-fascist movements.

Religious and community organizations engaged in social justice work would face difficult choices about continuing programs that could be interpreted as supporting a designated terrorist organization’s ideology. Labor unions might prohibit solidarity activities with anti-fascist activists. Nonprofit legal organizations could suspend representation of activists facing charges.

This phenomenon, known to scholars as “anticipatory conformity,” demonstrates how the mere existence of broad criminal penalties can achieve censorship objectives without formal enforcement. Organizations and individuals modify behavior to avoid potential prosecution, effectively accomplishing the government’s regulatory goals through self-censorship. The cumulative effect would be the systematic elimination of civil society infrastructure supporting resistance to far-right political movements.

International Coordination and Enforcement

These domestic effects would be amplified by international coordination that extends the reach of American FTO authorities globally. The European response to Trump’s domestic Antifa designation in September reveals the international dimension of this campaign. Far-right parties across Europe have demanded similar designations in their own countries. The Dutch parliament passed a resolution calling for a terrorist designation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced parallel measures. A draft resolution reportedly backed by 79 Members of the European Parliament from 20 countries calls for EU-wide designation.

This international far-right strategic coordination – simultaneously targeting “Antifa,” an amorphous movement with no clear organizational hierarchy, across multiple democracies – serves a common purpose: eliminating organized resistance to far-right governance by recharacterizing political opposition as terrorism.

An American FTO designation could provide legal foundation for far-right European prosecutions of American activists traveling abroad. Under existing mutual legal assistance treaties, European authorities could request extradition of Americans for “terrorism-related” activities that constitute protected political speech in the United States. International asset freezing orders could create global enforcement networks targeting democratic opposition.

The Hungarian approach illustrates these possibilities. The government of Viktor Orbán has used its Antifa classification to pursue terrorism charges against Italian MEP Ilaria Salis for allegedly participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right groups. This demonstrates how terrorist designations can transform routine political disagreement into criminal conspiracy, creating a template that could be applied to American activists abroad.

The integration of domestic and international enforcement could create a comprehensive global system for monitoring and prosecuting political opposition, transcending national boundaries and constitutional protections that have traditionally limited government surveillance authority.

The Self-Defeating Logic of Counterterrorism Overreach

The profound irony of designating Antifa as an FTO is that weaponizing counterterrorism authorities against domestic political movements will inevitably undermine those very tools when deployed against genuine international terrorist threats. The FTO framework and material support statutes have proven remarkably effective in disrupting al-Qaeda and ISIS networks precisely because courts have afforded them substantial deference based on their narrow application to FTOs that pose legitimate national security threats.

Once these authorities are stretched to encompass domestic political opposition — applied to Americans engaged in constitutionally protected speech and association — that judicial deference should evaporate. Federal courts confronting cases where naturalized citizens face denaturalization for attending protests, or where nonprofits are prosecuted for providing legal defense funds, will likely be compelled to impose constitutional limitations that have been unnecessary when the targets were genuinely foreign terrorist networks. The inevitable wave of successful constitutional challenges will probably force courts to narrow material support definitions, impose heightened intent requirements, and establish First Amendment protections, as well as other safeguards, that will then apply equally to prosecutions of actual terrorism support.

Congressional appetite for FISA reauthorization — already strained by documented FBI abuses in querying Section 702 data on protesters, political donors, and even members of Congress — will surely further erode when those authorities are systematically deployed against political opposition rather than foreign intelligence targets. The House Judiciary Committee has already advanced legislation to substantially curtail FISA authorities in response to civil liberties concerns, and adding domestic political targeting to this record could make reauthorization politically untenable.

The result of pursuing the chimera of “Antifa terrorism” could lead to the systematic dismantling of the legal infrastructure that has successfully prevented another September 11th-scale attack, opening genuine vulnerabilities to al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other international terrorist organizations that pose real threats to American security. By misappropriating tools designed to protect Americans from foreign terrorism to instead target Americans for their political beliefs, the administration risks achieving the ultimate counterterrorism failure: strengthening the nation’s real enemies while weakening the legal framework designed to combat them.

Strategic Response Options for Civil Society

Despite these formidable challenges, civil society organizations and democratic institutions retain several avenues for strategically responding. Understanding these options becomes crucial as the threat of FTO expansion moves from theoretical to imminent. Congressional oversight represents a potential avenue for institutional resistance, though one unlikely to bear immediate fruit given current political alignments. While the House and Senate Judiciary Committees technically possess authority over terrorism designations and could demand detailed justifications for applying FTO frameworks to domestic political movements, prominent members of Congress have become some of the loudest advocates for FTO designation.

Congressional appropriators theoretically could restrict funding for enforcement activities targeting constitutionally protected political speech, but such efforts would face steep political headwinds. The more realistic congressional strategy focuses on building a factual record through minority oversight efforts — hearings, letters, and reports documenting constitutional concerns — that could support future legal challenges and lay the groundwork for legislative reform should political conditions change after subsequent election cycles. In the immediate term, however, civil society must look beyond Congress to other institutional mechanisms for resistance.

State and local governments also retain significant authority to resist federal overreach. State attorneys general possess independent prosecutorial discretion and could refuse cooperation with federal investigations targeting protected political activity. Several states are considering legislation limiting cooperation with federal political surveillance operations, similar to existing immigration sanctuary policies.

Legal challenges could focus on multiple constitutional vulnerabilities. First Amendment protections for political association create barriers to criminalizing ideological movements. Due Process violations in the secretive designation process could provide grounds for challenge. Equal Protection concerns about selective targeting of left-wing movements while ignoring comparable right-wing threats might support discrimination claims or claims of arbitrary and capricious government conduct.

Out of an abundance of caution at least, organizations should establish robust compliance monitoring and due diligence frameworks to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. This includes implementing comprehensive legal review processes for activities, partnerships, and funding sources that could face heightened scrutiny under expanded terrorism authorities. Legal counsel should regularly assess organizational exposure under material support statutes and maintain current knowledge of designation criteria and enforcement trends. Organizations should establish systematic tracking of relevant legislative and regulatory developments, including congressional hearings, agency guidance, and judicial decisions that could affect operational parameters. Financial compliance protocols should include enhanced due diligence on funding sources, grant recipients, and international partnerships to ensure alignment with applicable sanctions regulations. Regular legal audits of programs, communications, and institutional relationships can help identify potential vulnerabilities before they become predicates or excuses for enforcement issues. Organizations should also establish clear documentation protocols for activities, decision-making processes, and compliance efforts to demonstrate good faith efforts to operate within legal boundaries.

Professional associations — bar organizations, academic societies, and press freedom groups — must take public stands against FTO expansion into the domestic political space. The American Bar Association, representing over 400,000 lawyers, could provide crucial legitimacy to constitutional and other legal challenges while offering resources for targeted individuals and organizations.

Strategic communications efforts must educate the public about the implications of applying foreign terrorism authorities to domestic political movements, though public opinion on constitutional rights presents a complicated picture. Recent polling shows 53 percent of Americans believe the First Amendment “goes too far in the rights it guarantees,” while 47 percent support “a strong leader that breaks the rules.” These attitudes create favorable conditions for executive overreach, making strategic communications critical to connect abstract FTO designation to concrete consequences such as: targeting nonprofit donors, criminalizing protest participation, censoring social media, and enabling deportation of naturalized citizens for political activities. These tangible consequences may resonate more powerfully than appeals to constitutional principles, particularly when framed around personal vulnerabilities that terrorism authorities would create for millions of Americans across the political spectrum.

Constitutional Crisis and Democratic Resilience

These response strategies operate within a broader context of a constitutional crisis that transcends any single policy or legal framework. The potential designation of Antifa as an FTO represents a fundamental test of American constitutional democracy’s resilience. To be clear: The U.S. government already has the legal tools necessary to investigate domestic criminal activity by Antifa adherents. The FTO framework was designed to combat genuine foreign terrorist threats to American security. Applying these powerful authorities to domestic political movements would represent an unprecedented expansion that threatens core constitutional principles.

The implications extend well beyond anti-fascist activists to any domestic political movement maintaining international connections. Environmental groups coordinating with European counterparts, labor unions participating in international solidarity campaigns, and human rights organizations working with foreign partners could all theoretically face similar targeting under expanded FTO authorities.

As White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has articulated, the administration views opposition to its policies through a conspiratorial lens. He has characterized the Democratic Party as “a domestic extremist organization” and claimed the existence of “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country.” This stated worldview creates conditions where routine political opposition could be reframed as terrorism worthy of the full spectrum of counterterrorism responses.

The systematic weakening of oversight mechanisms — from inspector general dismissals to civil rights office closures — has created ideal conditions for expanding terrorism authorities into the domestic political space. Without effective institutional constraints, the powerful authorities designed to combat foreign terrorism could be redirected against American citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activity.

The designation would mark a dark turn in American democratic development. Once the precedent is established that domestic political movements can be criminalized through foreign terrorism designations, constraining these authorities becomes exponentially more difficult. The secrecy surrounding counterterrorism operations, the broad scope of material support statutes, and the deference courts typically show to national security claims create conditions where such authorities tend to expand rather than contract.

The current moment requires extraordinary vigilance from American civil society. The FTO system represents one of the most powerful tools in the federal government’s legal arsenal, deliberately designed to dismantle targeted organizations quickly and comprehensively. While these authorities have served important national security purposes when applied to genuine foreign terrorist threats, their application to domestic political movements would fundamentally alter the balance between security and liberty that defines American constitutional democracy.

The only reliable safeguard against such expansion is sustained lawful opposition from informed citizens, civil society organizations, and constitutional institutions committed to preserving the framework that makes democratic opposition possible. The stakes have never been higher, and the time for preventive action is rapidly diminishing.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239999886.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:40.250713

The ECHR forms part of UK law but is interpreted by a European court

Unlike other human rights treaties, the ECHR has a court to rule on whether governments are compliant. The UK agreed to let people take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in the 1960s.

In addition, the Human Rights Act 1998 made the ECHR part of UK domestic law. People can appeal against government immigration decisions, such as a family visa refusal or deportation for criminal offending, before an immigration judge in the UK if there is a human rights angle.

The 1998 act also requires the UK courts to “take into account” the case law of the European Court. As a result, the precedents set by the court in Strasbourg affect UK immigration law even if the UK is not involved in the case.

Article 3 and Article 8 of the ECHR can be used to contest immigration decisions

Under the European Court’s “living instrument” doctrine, its interpretation of ECHR rights can change over time. In the 1980s, the court began to rule that migrants could invoke Article 8 and Article 3 of the ECHR.

Article 8 protects the right to family and private life. Article 8 does not give families a right to choose their country of residence, but it may require someone to be granted residence rights depending on the individual circumstances. These circumstances, such as the strength of the family’s ties in the country of residence and the obstacles to living together abroad, have to be balanced against the state’s interest in immigration enforcement to see whether removal is proportionate.

Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. If someone would experience treatment reaching this threshold, as interpreted by the court, they cannot be removed under any circumstances.

Article 8 cases involve balancing the public interest with individual circumstances

ECHR rights are reflected in the UK’s immigration rules and appeals system. This means that people can be granted residence rights based on ECHR considerations where they would not otherwise qualify (for example, if they had been living here without authorisation).

The immigration rules on Article 8 family life include allowing people to stay if there would be insurmountable obstacles to a couple living together outside the UK or if there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences for the family. Separate rules on Article 8 private life cover scenarios where people have been living in the UK without authorisation as children or for many years.

People whose Article 8 claim is denied by the Home Office can appeal to the immigration tribunal in the UK. The judge will weigh up the public interest in immigration control against the person’s family or private life, taking a wide range of factors into account, to decide whether removal is proportionate. This is known as the “balancing exercise” or “balance sheet” approach.

In cases where the person has committed a criminal offence, legislation passed in 2014 has raised the bar for an appeal to succeed, although British judges still retain some discretion to block deportation in compelling cases.

From 2015 to 2024, around 61,000 ECHR appeals were successful in the first-tier immigration tribunal. Recent media coverage has highlighted appeals by criminals specifically, although successful challenges based solely on the ECHR represent around 3% of completed deportations for criminal offending.

The Labour government wants to reinforce previous attempts to limit ECHR rights

Under Theresa May, the Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016, the government changed the immigration rules and passed primary legislation aiming at limiting discretion in Article 8 cases. The courts have sought to demonstrate respect for this aim while upholding their role in adjudicating on what constitutes a breach of ECHR rights in individual cases.

Since taking office, the Prime Minister and several Cabinet ministers have said that they believe too many ECHR cases are successful despite not being truly exceptional. An internal government review is underway and an immigration white paper has promised legislation on Article 8.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Egypt sent a team of experts to Gaza this weekend to help locate the bodies of deceased Israeli hostages, according to a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The spokesperson added that Netanyahu had approved a purely “technical team” and that its members were not connected to the Egyptian army. Egyptian state media reported that logistical support and earth-moving equipment had been sent to Gaza. Senior Hamas Official Khalil al-Hayya said on Sunday that Hamas has started searching in new areas of Gaza for the remaining 13 hostages. Isabel Kershner reports for the New York Times; Samy Magdy and Melanie Lidman report for AP News.

The U.S. military is operating surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip to ensure that both Israel and Hamas adhere to the ceasefire agreement, Israeli and American officials said on Friday. The sources added that the surveillance missions are operating to support the new Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel. Natan Odenheimer and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

“We have […] made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are acceptable to us,” Netanyahu said yesterday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the international force would be made up of “countries that Israel’s comfortable with.” Steven Scheer reports for Reuters.

Israel’s military said on Saturday that Israeli forces carried out a “targeted strike” on a member of Islamic Jihad in central Gaza, who was allegedly planning an attack on Israeli troops. Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the Israeli military’s claim of a planned attack was a “mere fallacious allegation.” Local medics said that four people were wounded in a drone strike, but there were no immediate reports of deaths. Witnesses separately reported that Israeli tanks had shelled eastern areas of Gaza City. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters reports.

An Israeli drone attack today has killed at least one person in Abasan al-Kabira, near Khan Younis in Gaza, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Al Jazeera reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

UNRWA said yesterday that Israel continues to block its international staff and humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Around 12,000 of its local staff are pushing ahead with providing “health-care, psychosocial support, and education to the people,” UNRWA added in a post on social media. Tim Hume and Stephen Quillen report for Al Jazeera.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drones killed three people and injured 31 others, including six children, in an air attack on Kyiv on Saturday night. A separate drone attack on Friday night killed two people and injured 13 others, also in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Moscow had used nearly 1,200 attack drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs, and over 50 missiles against Ukraine in the last seven days. Lidia Kelly and Pavel Polityuk report for Reuters; Anastasiia Malenko reports for Reuters.

Russia successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, a weapon that Moscow says is capable of piercing any defence shield, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday. Russia’s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov, told Putin that the missile travelled 14,000 km and was in the air for around 15 hours. Guy Faulconbridge and Lidia Kelly report for Reuters

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Argentinian President Javier Milei’s Freedom Advances party secured nearly 41% of the national vote in Argentina’s legislative elections yesterday, nearly doubling its representation in Congress. Trump congratulated Milei on his “landslide victory” on social media, later adding “BIG WIN […] for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate!” Ali Walker reports for POLITICO.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas announced yesterday that Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh would temporarily assume the leadership of the Palestinian Authority if Abbas were to step down or die. Sheikh would hold those powers for 90 days before elections would take place to pick a new leader. Aaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon report for the New York Times.

Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced yesterday that it is withdrawing its fighters from Turkey to northern Iraq “to avoid clashes or provocations.” The PKK had announced earlier this year that it would disband and renounce armed conflict in Turkey, ending four decades of fighting. Stella Martany and Cinar Kiper AP News.

The Pakistani military said yesterday that 5 Pakistani soldiers and 25 fighters from Afghanistan died in clashes near the border. Officials from both countries arrived in Istanbul on Saturday for talks aimed at preventing a full-scale conflict. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja said that failure to reach an agreement in Istanbul would mean “open war.” Ariba Shahid reports for Reuters.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary yesterday claimed that it had captured the Sudanese army’s headquarters in El-Fasher. Two videos shared by the RSF show its soldiers cheering outside the army base; Reuters was not able to verify the date of this video. The army has yet to give a statement on its current position. Khalid Abdelaziz and Nafisa Eltahir report.

Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon yesterday killed three people, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah members, adding that it had killed Ali Hussein al-Mousawi, who “played a significant role in the re-establishment and strengthening of Hezbollah.” Hezbollah has not confirmed any information about the deaths. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said that an Israeli drone had dropped a grenade close to one of its patrols on Sunday afternoon. Al Jazeera reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Sixty-five nations this weekend signed the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi. The treaty establishes the first universal framework for investigating and prosecuting offences committed online and facilitates the sharing of electronic evidence across borders. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “It is a vow that no country, no matter their level of deployment, will be left defenceless against cybercrime.” Vibhu Mishra reports for UN News.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration is planning to reorganize ICE by replacing several senior leaders in field offices across the country, according to sources. The sources said that the proposals stem from frustration in the Homeland Security Department and the White House that Trump’s goal of deporting over 1 million people in his first year in office is not being met. Hamed Aleaziz and Tyler Pager report for the New York Times.

The Department for Homeland Security said on Friday that it plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Gracia to the “thriving democracy” of Liberia within a week, according to a court filing. The Justice Department has previously attempted to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, but none of these countries agreed to take him. Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

Immigration authorities yesterday detained British commentator Sami Hamdi and revoked his visa, a Homeland Security Department official said. Hamdi spoke at a gala for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) in California on Saturday and was due to speak in Florida on Sunday but he was detained at San Francisco International Airport. Conservative activist Laura Loomer took credit for Hamdi’s arrest on social media. Stephen Coates reports for Reuters.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

A U.S. military strike against an alleged drug vessel on Friday killed six people in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media. Hegseth said it was the first strike carried out at night and claimed that the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Hegseth has ordered the deployment of the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, along with its accompanying warships and attack planes, to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, the Pentagon said on Friday. The enhanced U.S. military presence “will bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” a Pentagon spokesperson said. It is unclear when Ford will be moving to the region or where exactly it will be positioned. Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

USS Graveley, a U.S. guided missile destroyer, yesterday docked in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago’s capital. U.S. officials and officials from Trinidad and Tobago said the warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so that both countries can carry out training exercises. Venezuela said the “dangerous conduct of military exercises” in the waters of a neighboring country constitutes a “serious threat” to the Caribbean region, according to a statement from the Venezuelan foreign ministry.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump cosigned a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia yesterday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. The first phase of the agreement involves Thailand’s release of 18 Cambodian soldiers and the removal of heavy weapons and landmines from the border region. Malaysian troops are being deployed to ensure the fighting does not restart. Erin Hale and Tim Hume report for Al Jazeera.

A Navy helicopter and a fighter jet based on the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier yesterday crashed into the South China Sea within 30 minutes of each other, the U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement. The causes of the two crashes are under investigation. Trump said today that the incidents could have been caused by “bad fuel,” ruling out foul play. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

U.S. intelligence, obtained in 2022, shows that the United Arab Emirates gave technology to China to upgrade its long-range missiles fired from fighter jets, according to six sources. Two sources said that the technology was passed to Huawei by G42, the UAE’s AI group. G42 disputed the U.S. intelligence, saying it categorically rejected the “false and defamatory allegations.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports for the Financial Times.

Chinese and U.S. negotiators said yesterday that they had agreed to a framework deal on tariffs and other issues ahead of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting this week. The issues discussed include bilateral trade, export controls, reciprocal tariff extensions, fentanyl-related tariffs, and cooperation on combating fentanyl trafficking, according to the Chinese negotiators. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. representative, said, “We talked about extending the truce, we talked about rare earths, of course, we talked about all kinds of topics.” Keith Bradsher and Zunaira Saieed report for the New York Times.

Trump announced on Saturday that he would increase tariffs on Canadian goods by 10% following the Canadian television ad that used clips from an address by Ronald Reagan. Matina Stevis Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning Colombian President Gustavo Petro because he provided “benefits” to “narco-terrorist organizations” since taking office in 2022. The department has also sanctioned Petro’s wife, his son, and Colombia’s interior minister. Julie Turkewitz reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A Pentagon spokesperson said on Friday that the Defense Department had accepted an anonymous gift of $130 million from a wealthy donor to pay military salaries during the government shutdown. Two sources named Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump, as the anonymous donor. Mellon has not confirmed this. White House officials said that covering the cost of military pay for the first half of October totalled about $6.5 billion. Leo Shane III, Paul McLeary, and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO; Tyler Page reports for the New York Times.

The Justice Department said on Friday that it will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the November 4 election “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” Shawn Hubler and Laurel Rosenhall report for the New York Times.

The Trump administration will not use emergency funds to cover the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program during the government shutdown, according to a memo obtained by POLITICO. SNAP is set to run out of federal funds at the end of the month, which would leave around 42 million people without the necessary food benefits from November. Administration officials believe that Democratic governors and anti-hunger groups will sue the administration for not tapping into the contingency fund for SNAP, two sources said. Grace Yarrow and Meredith Lee Hill report.

Trump last week nominated Hegseth’s senior military aide Lt. Gen. Chrisopher LaNeve to replace Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Mingus. The Senate still needs to approve LaNeve. Hegseth did not announce LaNeve’s nomination, nor did Mingus announce his departure, even though he is less than halfway through a four-year role. “Hegseth wants [LaNeve] in,” a defense official said. “Who he replaces doesn’t matter.” Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.
“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream.
The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela.
They’re going to be – like – dead.” Paul has had military-related disagreements with Trump before his Sunday interview on Fox.","The Trump administration’s military airstrikes against boats off Venezuela’s coast that the White House claims were being used for drug trafficking are “extrajudicial killings”, said Rand Paul, the president’s fellow Republican and US senator from Kentucky.

Paul’s strong comments on the topic came on Sunday during an interview on Republican-friendly Fox News, three days after Donald Trump publicly claimed he “can’t imagine” federal lawmakers would have “any problem” with the strikes when asked about seeking congressional approval for them.

US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

Speaking with Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream, Paul asserted that Congress has “gotten no information” on the campaign of strikes from Trump’s administration – despite the president claiming the White House would be open to briefing the federal lawmakers about the offensive.

“No one said their name, no one said what evidence, no one said whether they’re armed, and we’ve had no evidence presented,” Paul said of the targeted boats or those on board. He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.

“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream. “So it’s wrong.”

Paul’s comments separate him from other Republican members of Congress who have spoken in favor of the Trump administration’s offensive near Venezuela, including US House representative Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, as reported by the US news website Semafor.

The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela. But the measure failed to win a majority in the Senate.

Trump on Friday told the media that his administration would be willing to brief lawmakers on the strikes but simply saw no reason to seek congressional authorization for them.

“I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump said. “We’re going to kill them. They’re going to be – like – dead.”

Josué Castro Rivera was on his way to his gardening job Thursday when ICE officers pulled over his vehicle and tried to detain him and three other passengers, according to his brother, Henry Castro.

Castro Rivera bolted on foot from the scene and attempted to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk — where a 2002 Ford pickup fatally struck him, according to state and federal authorities.

He was pronounced dead on the scene around 11 a.m., according to the Virginia State Police.

“He had a very good heart,” his devastated brother said Sunday.

Castro Rivera had been living in the US for four years and was sending money back to Honduras for his family, Henry said.

ICE officers had been carrying out a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation, and that the passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle hit him, the DHS said.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” his heartbroken brother said.

Castro Rivera’s family plans to raise money to send his body back to Honduras for a funeral, blasting his death as an “injustice.”

The DHS said the garden-worker’s death was “a direct result of every politician, activist, and reporter who continues to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths during immigration operations have triggered outrage and calls for additional investigations.

Last month in a Chicago suburb, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop.

The DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “nothing major.”

In July, a farmworker died after falling from a 30-foot-high roof during a chaotic immigration raid at a southern California marijuana farm.

In August, a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Immigration detention is supposed to be administrative, not punitive.","TORONTO, Oct. 27, 2025 /CNW/ - In a major procedural victory, the Ontario Court of Appeal has unanimously upheld the certification of a national human rights class action challenging Canada's practice of placing immigration detainees in provincial jails.

The matter is directed to proceed to trial as a Class Action.

In Richard v. Canada (Attorney General), more than 8,300 non-citizens detained in provincial and territorial prisons between 2016 and 2024 will pursue claims that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) violated their Charter rights and acted with systemic negligence. These immigration detainees were held in 87 provincial jails under agreements between CBSA and provincial governments. Many were asylum seekers or permanent residents.

The class members were detained in jails for purely administrative reasons. None of the members of the certified class were detained for criminal charges.

All provinces have now ended their immigration detention agreements and arrangements with the CBSA.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that claims alleging systemic negligence and breaches of sections 7, 9, 12 and 15 of the Charter should proceed to trial. These claims concern fundamental rights concerning liberty, arbitrary detention, cruel treatment, and discrimination. The Courts have ruled that those claims raise common legal and factual issues for the class which are deserving of adjudication at trial.

Human-Rights Criticism

The Canadian Red Cross, the UN Human Rights Committee, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International have all criticized Canada for detaining non-citizens in jails alongside convicted offenders, subjecting them to strip searches, lockdowns, segregation, and restricted access to counsel and family.

Their findings describe these practices as inconsistent with international standards, which require immigration detention to be non-punitive, humane, and a measure of last resort.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests.
He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.” At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement.
On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief.
Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.","Three states—California, Oregon, and Illinois—are currently suing the Trump administration over its National Guard deployments in separate lawsuits with mixed results. Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a major setback to California Governor Gavin Newsom by allowing Trump to continue to deploy the National Guard units while litigation continues.

There are significant legal questions at stake in these cases, namely when and how the president can deploy the National Guard on American soil, and what courts, states, and Congress can and have done to constrain him. In another sense, what’s really at the core of these cases is whether judges can see what’s happening right in front of them.

Newsom v. Trump is extraordinarily tangled at the moment because separate portions of the case are being considered simultaneously in different federal courts. Last week’s ruling by the Ninth Circuit dealt with the lower court’s decision to issue a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration over the summer. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on that initial TRO and the court decisions that followed it.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests. Those raids drew large numbers of protesters. In response, Trump federalized the California National Guard and ordered it to protect federal immigration agents as they carried out their raids and arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration to challenge the National Guard’s federalization and deployment.

In the lawsuit, Newsom argued that the deployment was unlawful, unconstitutional, and procedurally invalid. Judge Charles Breyer, who happens to be the younger brother of retired Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled in the governor’s favor and granted a temporary restraining order. His ruling was blunt about what had happened.

“At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the president followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions,” Breyer wrote. “He did not. His actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.”

At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement. The administration has pointed to language from a provision in federal law known as Section 12406, which comes from the Militia Act of 1903. On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief. The law in question, however, allows the president to “call [National Guard units] into federal service” under three circumstances.

One of those circumstances is if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation.” While the Trump administration has claimed that the “invasion” language in other laws and constitutional provisions can be triggered by the presence of undocumented immigrants, they did not rely on that argument here. Instead they pointed to the other two circumstances: if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of [the federal government],” or if the president is “unable with the regular forces to execute [federal law].”

The administration argued that the latter two conditions were met in Los Angeles (and in the other two cities, for that matter) because protesters were obstructing federal efforts to carry out mass deportations. Before that point, however, it also argued that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over Trump’s actions, citing the 1827 case Martin v. Mott.

Martin involved President James Madison’s use of the New York militia during the War of 1812. Jacob Mott, a member of the militia, refused to comply and was court-martialed after the war ended. This was not uncommon as many Federalists in New England opposed the war. In a subsequent lawsuit, Mott claimed that his court-martial was invalid because he had not disobeyed lawful orders, effectively rejecting Madison’s authority to call up and direct the militia during the war.

The Supreme Court disagreed and ruled that Madison’s actions were lawful. Justice Joseph Story wrote in broad strokes. He concluded that Congress had lawfully delegated the discretion about activating the militia to the president, and that his decision as to whether or not an emergency existed to justify it was “conclusive upon all other persons.” Story gave broad latitude to the president in these circumstances. “Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts,” he wrote.

That sounds, at least on its face, like a pretty strong precedent for the administration to cite. Breyer was unconvinced. He noted that the court’s deference stemmed at least in part from its historic pattern of deferral to the president in matters of war and national security. The War of 1812 obviously counted as such; law-enforcement raids in Los Angeles plainly do not. In addition, Breyer noted, the Supreme Court had not embraced such a deferential approach to presidential decision-making in general in the two hundred years of rulings that followed Martin.

“Between the unique concerns raised by federal military intrusion into civilian affairs and the fact that federal officials are not uniquely positioned to ascertain what is happening on the ground (as compared to, say, state and local officials), the Court is not convinced that the judiciary cannot question presidential assertions about domestic activities leading to military action,” Breyer concluded.

The three-judge Ninth Circuit panel, which consisted of two Trump appointees and a Biden appointee, took a much different approach. It viewed the Martin ruling as broadly applicable to the present day. The panel noted that “some of the Martin Court’s reasoning addressed factual circumstances of that case that are not present here, particularly the Court’s consideration of the nature of a foreign invasion and concerns about militiamen disobeying orders.” Nonetheless, it concluded that “we must give a great level of deference to the President’s determination that a predicate condition exists” because of the ruling.

California asked the Ninth Circuit to review the panel’s decision in an en banc hearing, meaning that the entire appellate court would review it. (Since the Ninth Circuit is so large, it only uses a subset of eleven judges for en banc hearings.) The court declined to do so, keeping the lower court’s restraining order on ice for now. That drew a strenuous dissent from Judge Marsha Berzon and some of her colleagues, who castigated the panel’s decision.

Among Berzon’s critiques was the panel’s approach to Martin. “Martin cannot, and does not, change the meaning of a statute not in effect when Martin was decided and whose predecessor, the Militia Act of 1795, was distinct from and not considered in Martin,” she explained. “Read carefully, in fact, Martin did not address at all courts’ authority to review the President’s exercise of his delegated power to call forth the militia.” (Emphasis hers.) Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.

This is a fraught exercise, to say the least, because Trump’s own arguments for the deployments often appear to be either exaggerated or even false. The president’s choice of targets also appears to hinge less on whether there is an actual emergency and more on whether he likes the city and its residents. Los Angeles and Chicago are disfavored and suffered accordingly; San Francisco, on the other hand, escaped Trump’s targeting for now because Silicon Valley billionaires called him this week and asked him not to intervene.

The panel found that events on the ground met that threshold. “There is evidence that the day before, protesters threw objects at ICE vehicles trying to complete a law enforcement operation, ‘pinned down’ several FPS officers defending federal property by throwing ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects,’ and used ‘large rolling commercial dumpsters as a battering ram” in an attempt to breach the parking garage of a federal building,’” it noted when summarizing the evidence presented to it.

Breyer drew different conclusions. “While [federal officials] have pointed to several instances of violence, they have not identified a violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole,” he wrote. “The definition of rebellion is unmet.” The judge pointed out that while some protesters threw bottles and rocks, they were not carrying firearms and did not follow some central or organized authority that sought to overthrow the civil power.

The episodes of violence also occurred during otherwise peaceful protests. “Courts have repeatedly reaffirmed that peaceful protest does not lose its protection merely because some isolated individuals act violently outside the protections of the First Amendment,” Breyer observed. He rejected the notion that the collective totality of protests became a “rebellion” on such broad grounds.

On the other Section 12406 condition, that the president is “unable to execute the laws,” Breyer also found insufficient support for that reason. The Trump administration claimed it could have apprehended more people but for the protests. That was not enough, the judge concluded. “Nor does the statute allow for the federalizing of the National Guard when the president faces some risk in executing the laws, though of course federal employees should never have to fear danger when performing their jobs,” Breyer wrote. “The statute requires that the president be ‘unable’ to execute the laws of the United States. That did not happen here.”

The panel took a far more deferential view of the matter, however, and blocked Breyer’s temporary restraining order solely on the third condition—the “unable to execute the laws” one—by concluding that one was sufficient. That decision drew more criticism from Barzon when the Ninth Circuit denied en banc review. She noted that the third condition had only been invoked once before in its century-long existence under far more urgent circumstances.

“Although Section 12406(3) has been in existence for over 100 years, the only other time it has been invoked was when President Nixon federalized the National Guard to sort and deliver mail following a strike by over a quarter of all national postal workers, an event that “threatened to bring the nation to a standstill,” she noted. In an era before emails and the internet, this would have been devastating for the national economy—and crippling for the federal government’s basic operations.

Berzon was careful to note that while historical practice was not the actual boundary of the Section 12406 power, it could be highly indicative of its scope. “The 1970 invocation confirms that the text means precisely what it says: for the President to call forth the National Guard, he must actually and significantly lack the capacity to carry out certain laws through ordinary means,” she explained.

What truly separated the opinions of Breyer and Berzon from the panel’s opinion was not just different standards of review or jurisdictional questions, but a deeper sense of this country’s history and principles. These cases are not merely about whether the president happened to comply with a few pre-conditions in a particular federal law; they are about bedrock principles in the Anglo-American legal tradition.

“The rejection of military involvement in civil law enforcement except upon the most exigent circumstances traces to the events immediately preceding the American Revolution,” she wrote. “At that time, the British government used troops to enforce laws that American colonists widely considered oppressive and so inspired deep and enduring antagonism towards military involvement in domestic law enforcement.” These events led the Framers to put strict limits on when and how the military could be used on American soil for domestic purposes.

Newsom v. Trump is unlikely to be the vehicle by which these disputes reach the Supreme Court. That fate will likely fall to the Illinois litigation since the federal district-court judge and the Seventh Circuit all sided with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, which simplified matters. But the different approaches between the various judges in the California case are likely to be more illustrative of how the Supreme Court handles the matter. At its core, this is a case about determining whether the president is acting in good faith when wielding immense power. The justices’ track record on that front is not reassuring.",https://images.newrepublic.com/dc6712d7d281750de6b36cf1888296f657684e42.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-10-27 06:57:25.414425

But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace.
Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings.
As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017.
Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves.","The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Canal Street was not a pretty sight.

If President Trump wants to ensure Zohran Mamdani’s election so he can “take over” the city, as he’s warned, he couldn’t come up with a spectacle more certain to drive liberal New Yorkers into Mamdani’s camp than a squad of masked ICE agents, accompanied by an armored vehicle, descending on unlicensed street vendors in broad daylight to bust a whopping dozen or so for peddling counterfeit goods.

But unlike agitators who screamed “Fascist!” at the agents, our emotions should be nuanced. With City Hall unable or unwilling to protect legitimate Canal Street businesses and the public from the scourge of unlicensed sidewalk merchants, somebody had to do the job or at least begin to — even if the optics were terrible and the results minuscule.

I celebrate and honor the Big Apple’s diversity and singularly colorful street life. But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace. The cheap wooden animals, “I ❤️ New York” caps and bogus Gucci and Cartier products — and the guys who sell them — have Canal in a stranglehold. The abandonment to sidewalk anarchy stalled a nascent revival that was on the point of making the run-down boulevard worthy of its potentially iconic crosstown location.

Imagine how much worse it would be if misdemeanor-friendly Mamdani gave the hustlers even more free rein than they already enjoy!

Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings. One owner told me in 2017, “Canal is in significant flux.” But that was before “bail reform,” “Raise the Age” and legions of leftist judges and elected officials made prosecution of most crimes short of murder ineffectual.

As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017. Reason No. 1: The lawless sidewalk scene scared off potential retail tenants needed to anchor new buildings.

“I buy and sell and lease on Canal, so you can’t use my name. It was already the worst and noisiest traffic bottleneck in Manhattan. But the vendors are the worst deal-breakers,” one real-estate executive told me after the ICE raid. “I don’t like the way ICE did it, I’m the farthest thing from a Trumper, but somebody had to get a handle on this thing.”

The day after the raid, with the hustlers (at least for now) chased out, I was able to truly see — and appreciate — the street for the first time I could remember. Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves. Recent incremental changes made it a somewhat softer and gentler outskirt. The familiar engines of urban regeneration — lower rents than in neighboring districts, easy transit accessibility and enough surviving old-school grit to qualify as “edgy” — drew small boutiques, art galleries and even a hotel or two.

The blocks along the Holland Tunnel approach now have enough interesting shops and galleries to seem cutting-edge, the way Alphabet City did before gentrification. A stroller west of Canal’s bustling Chinatown portion will find the “largest Banksy museum in the world,” a former bank turned into a haunted house, Nordic Knots handmade rugs, the members-only “Social Wellness Club” and a Brooklyn Circus menswear shop. They uneasily share the sidewalks with mysterious shopping arcades and retailers of hardware, lighting fixtures, plastics and a thriving foam-rubber shop with a “Now hiring” sign.

But as the funky brick-and-mortar improved inch by inch, the unchecked proliferation of menacing vendors made much of the street a creepshow, especially at night.

Hustlers so dominate Broadway and Canal’s south corner that my wife and I, having alighted from the subway, took a cab to a restaurant just three blocks away to avoid a gauntlet of aggressive, marijuana-puffing vendors backed by a soundtrack of boom-box rap music. The scene wasn’t merely ugly — it was scary.

It’s not only my impression. NY1 reported last month that 800 local business owners signed a petition demanding more NYPD enforcement on and around Canal Street, citing open drug dealing, unreported muggings and robberies and sidewalk defecation. The NYPD responded that it’s conducting “targeted operations” to stem the sleaze, but before ICE stormed in, there was little if any visible improvement.

Of course, shoddy goods fill sidewalks all over Midtown. Hustlers even took over the Brooklyn Bridge’s narrow pedestrian walkways until a New York Post exposé shamed Mayor Adams’ team into getting rid of them (although they’ve begun crawling back).",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-j9xi1ipkb-1761500729558.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761486389&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 07:16:47.242582

This past summer, Hamdi took a speaking tour in South Africa, where he spoke with The Voice of the Cape, the country's first Muslim radio station.","The largest Muslim civil rights organization in the United States is calling for the release of British journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained by immigration officials at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday while on a US speaking tour.

""Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government's genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,"" said the Washington, DC-based Council on American-Islamic Relations in a statement. Hamdi was in California to speak at CAIR's annual gala on Saturday. On Sunday, he was heading to Florida to speak at another of the group's events.

US Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed on social media Sunday that ""thanks to the work of"" DHS chief Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ""and the men and women of law enforcement,"" Hamdi's visa was revoked and he is in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody pending removal.

Under President Donald Trump, McLaughlin said, ""those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country. It's common sense.""

""We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

McLaughlin also linked to a social media post from Amy ""Mek"" Mekelburg, the founder and editor-in-chief of Rise Align Ignite Reclaim (RAIR), which CAIR identifies as ""a hate organization and website that regularly publishes anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim conspiracy theories."" Both Mekelburg and far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer publicly celebrated ICE's detention of Hamdi.

Meanwhile, CAIR said that ""our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice. We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

""Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel First bigots,"" the group added. ""This is an Israel First policy, not an America First policy, and it must end.""

Throughout Trump's second term, his administration has provided the Israeli government with diplomatic and weapons support—like his Democratic predecessor—while targeting foreign scholars critical of Israel's genocide in the Gaza Strip for deportation. The administration has also engaged in a broader crackdown on dissent.

Blasting Hamdi's detention and potential deportation, Yasir Qadhi, a Pakistani American Muslim scholar and dean of the Islamic Seminary of America in Texas, said on social media Sunday: ""Our government is doing this on behalf of and as Israel's proxy, because he is a vocal critic of that genocidal regime. Our country is heading towards a fascist dictatorship in which any speech that goes against the official narrative is going to be criminalized.""

""This is happening within the context of the most hate-filled, blatant, anti-Muslim bigotry we've seen in our lifetimes,"" he continued, pointing to the New York City mayoral race. ""Disagree with Sami's message all you want, but do so with facts and evidence, not by banning and deporting. Unless they come back to their senses, these same people who are being whipped up into such hysteria will happily and willingly become the very embodiments of evil that they claim to fight, and that inhumane evil will be directed against multiple minorities, not just Muslims.""

Hamdi is ""the managing director of the International Interest, a global risk and intelligence company,"" according to his LinkedIn profile. He advises governments on the geopolitical dynamics of Europe and the Middle East and North Africa region, and ""has significant expertise in advising companies on commercial issues related to volatile political environments.""

Hamdi has bachelor's and master's degrees from the prestigious SOAS University of London, and has provided commentary on Al Jazeera, BBC, TRT World, and other outlets. In response to Hamdi's detention, Drop Site News shared his recent interview on Sky News about the ceasefire in Gaza after two years of US-backed Israel's genocidal assault.

This past summer, Hamdi took a speaking tour in South Africa, where he spoke with The Voice of the Cape, the country's first Muslim radio station. In an interview, he credited his father, Mohamed Hechmi Hamdi, for his political awareness.

""My father was very active in politics; he was the head of the student movement in Tunisia, head of the Islamist Tunisian Student Movement, sentenced at 20 years of age, imprisoned at 19, imprisoned at 20, had to flee Tunisia, went to Algeria and then Sudan, and then ended up in London,"" Hamdi explained. ""He then became a prominent voice in trying to push back against dictatorial regimes in Tunisia, and I grew up under that sort of umbrella, even if it was not something I wanted to embrace, as I wanted to be a footballer.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61932282&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C10%2C0%2C10,N,,2025-10-27 08:56:50.142729

Why it matters: Fear in one of the country's poorest regions shows how the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is shaking a vulnerable labor force, mostly undocumented, overwhelming churches and food banks.

The raids in the region are also partly forcing the Trump administration to warn Americans of a looming food crisis brought on by its own crackdown on undocumented farmworkers.

Zoom in: Axios recently interviewed more than a dozen farmworkers, volunteers, advocates and religious leaders in the Coachella Valley, who said the panic is pushing families to the brink of starvation and mental health breakdowns.

They said some families with undocumented members are being reduced to one breadwinner (or none) as farmworkers opt not to work out of anxiety that a raid could nab them away.

They said families are keeping U.S.-born children home from school, often over images they've seen on social media from other cities of immigration agents arresting parents in cars while picking up students.

They said three-bedroom trailers have become homes to three families, sometimes accommodating as many as 15 people per dwelling, as people try to combine resources for survival.

What they're saying: ""People are scared to even come out of the house. They just sit inside, getting depressed,"" farmworker organizer Rosalba De La Cruz told Axios in Spanish.

""I've never seen it like this,"" Imelda Barragan, a farmworker, said in Spanish. She's seen periodic raids in the area over the decades.

Reyes Lopez, a lead community organizer with the Inland Congregations United for Change, said the cruelty of the raids puzzles people, especially since workers are needed in this area, which can get to 115 degrees.

The other side: ""Under Secretary (Kristi) Noem, our brave law enforcement officers are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin tells Axios.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training. There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells Axios.

Zoom out: The Coachella Valley, a desert area in Southern California that's a 2 1/2 hours drive east of Los Angeles, is a popular tourist destination with towns like Palm Springs and events like the Coachella music festival.

It also supports year-round farming because of its warm, sunny climate and access to irrigation fed by the Colorado River.

It employs tens of thousands of farmworkers, generating billions of dollars annually.

The region produces crops during the winter months when other areas can't, helping stabilize the national food supply.

The valley is one of the country's leading producers of winter vegetables and fruits, particularly dates, leafy greens, bell peppers, table grapes and citrus fruits.

Between the lines: Religious and multifaith groups like PICO California and Catholic archdioceses are stepping in to help farmworkers.

Axios witnessed volunteers and fellow farmworkers with permanent residency status organize a food bank at Mission San Juan Diego in Mecca, Calif. Dozens of cars of needy farmworkers lined up for three days' worth of donated food.

Meanwhile, some struggling families are taking in U.S.-born children of parents recently deported.

Over 65% of people in the Eastern Coachella Valley live in poverty, according to the Coachella Valley Rescue Mission.

The bottom line: Rev. Rocendo Herrera of Our Lady of Guadalupe Sanctuary in Mecca tells Axios that since the raids, every week the Catholic church gets around 4,000 people for services.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1492180/story_image/AP469146883244.jpg?1761341268,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:52.749402

“Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” the Council on American-Islamic Relations civil rights group wrote on X.

Hamdi had spoken at a gala for the group on Saturday in California and was heading to Florida for another event prior to his arrest.

“I demanded that federal authorities inside the Trump administration treat Hamdi as the major National security threat that he is and I reported Sami Hamdi to federal immigration authorities over his documented support for Islamic terrorism,” she wrote on X.

Hamdi, who founded the outlet The International Interest and appears as a commentator on various mainstream news networks, has been a vocal critic of the Israeli war effort in Gaza, joining the scores of international observers who have deemed it a genocide.

He also celebrated the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel as an important moment in the cause for Palestinian self-determination, and wrote in May post on X he stood against “racism, Islamophobia, anti-semitism, genocide, and war crimes.”

Boston University News Service

President Trump announced a proclamation to revise the H-1B non-immigrant visa program on Sept. 19, 2025, stating that it has been widely “abused” by employers. The H-1B visa program was initially established by the Immigration Act of 1990, signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush.

Under the original act, immigrant categories were divided into three groups: family-based immigrants, employment-based immigrants, and diversity immigrants. This structure allowed people to immigrate to the U.S. (S.358 — 101st Congress).

Employment-based immigrants, listed under Title 1: Immigrants, Subtitle B: Preference System, Part 2: Employment-Based Immigrants, are primarily skilled workers with “extraordinary ability” in research or academic roles and are limited to a maximum stay of six years. The H-1B Specialty Occupations visa serves as a step toward obtaining an Employment-Based green card or offers a faster pathway for individuals to enter the U.S.

Since 1990, amendments have been made, including the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA), which temporarily increased the number of visas issued annually, and the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act of 2000, which extended the visa cap again.

Recent changes to the H-1B visa program, including a new payment requirement, could lead to a decline in research activity and a reduction in healthcare providers and access to medical treatment. According to a 2024 report by the American Medical Association, the U.S. already faces a significant physician shortage, leaving millions without proper healthcare access.

Immigration attorney Giselle M. Rodriguez said many people are already on high alert about these changes and are preparing backup options.

“While the full implementation of the new rules is still pending, we’ve already seen a shift in behavior from both employers and foreign nationals,” said Attorney Rodriguez. “There’s increased caution, especially among companies that rely heavily on H-1B talent. Some are delaying sponsorship decisions until there’s more clarity on costs and eligibility. There is really a sense of urgency and uncertainty. Many are actively exploring backup options or alternative visa categories.”

In President Trump’s new revision of the H-1B policy, all individuals petitioning for a non-immigrant visa program will be required to pay or be endorsed with a payment of $100,000 for entry into the United States. This proclamation came into effect on Sept. 21, 2025, and will remain in effect for 12 months after this date.

Attorney Rodriguez warns that the H-1B policy has broader implications for healthcare and the overall economy of the United States.

“The proposed changes could impact how U.S. employers approach hiring international talent,” said Attorney Rodriguez. “There’s a large pool of highly qualified people from around the world, especially in areas like engineering, healthcare, finance, and research, who contribute meaningfully to the U.S. workforce. In the long run, employers may need to be more selective and intentional about who they sponsor, which could limit opportunities for some while opening doors for others.”

Boston University is one of the few universities that welcomes a diverse group of international students from around the world. According to the U.S. News & World Report, 21% of Boston University’s student body are international students.

For any future Boston University international graduates or any other international individuals, Attorney Rodriguez advises planning and taking advantage of programs and organizations that will allow individuals to stay in the U.S.

“Be proactive and strategic. Start planning as early as possible, ideally before graduation. Take full advantage of programs like OPT [Optional Practice Training] and STEM OPT extensions, and consider employment with cap-exempt institutions such as universities or research organizations,” said Attorney Rodirguez. “It’s also important to build a strong resume in your field and target employers with a history of successful H-1B sponsorship. There are resources you could find online to help with this. Keeping open communication with your school’s international office and consulting with an immigration attorney can also help keep you updated with all these changes.”

Since the revision, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified on its website that this change will only affect new applicants after the Sept. 21, 2025, proclamation. Looking forward, we may expect to see significant pushback against the Trump administration and this immigration policy.",,N,,2025-10-26 19:56:54.227600

As SFist reported earlier this week, Trump deployed federal agents to the Bay Area earlier this week before suddenly calling them off Wednesday evening, first in San Francisco and then Oakland.

Prior to Saturday’s incident, about 50 agents were spotted in San Jose on September 10 when at least one person was arrested, per NBC Bay Area. Additionally, at least 13 immigrants were taken into custody in San Francisco on August 28, with seven detained outside an apartment complex near 10th and Harrison streets, according to Milli Atkinson, director of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative, per NBC Bay Area.

Advocates recommend the public report ICE sightings immediately to the Rapid Response Hotline. Stay up to date on nearby ICE sightings and arrests with the ICE Activity Tracker, and the Immigration Defense Project has a wealth of resources and information on knowing your rights and how to deal with ICE.

The press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote of Hamdi in a social media post: “This individual’s visa was revoked, and he is in ICE custody pending removal”.
In 2018, she infamously chained herself to Twitter’s headquarters in New York City in protest of her account being banned.

Hamdi is the latest of numerous immigrants who have been arrested and deported by ICE over pro-Palestinian views.","British journalist Sami Hamdi was reportedly detained on Sunday morning by federal immigration authorities at San Francisco international airport, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) says that action is apparent retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US.

A statement from Cair said it was “a blatant affront to free speech” to detain Hamdi for criticizing Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza while he engaged on a speaking tour in the US. A Trump administration official added in a separate statement that Hamdi is facing deportation.

“Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice,” Cair’s statement said. The statement also called on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “to immediately account for and release Mr Hamdi”, saying his only “‘crime’ is criticizing a foreign government” that Cair accused of having “committed genocide”.

The press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote of Hamdi in a social media post: “This individual’s visa was revoked, and he is in ICE custody pending removal”.

McLaughlin’s post also said: “Those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”

During his tour, Hamdi spoke on Saturday at the annual gala for Cair’s chapter in Sacramento. He was expected to speak on Sunday at the gala for the Florida chapter of Cair.

McLaughlin’s post about Hamdi’s detention was shared by Trump administration ally Laura Loomer, who took credit for his being taken into custody.

Loomer, who has called herself a “white advocate” and a “proud Islamophobe”, has often peddled conspiracy theories such as endorsing claims that the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 were an “inside job”.

In 2018, she infamously chained herself to Twitter’s headquarters in New York City in protest of her account being banned. Billionaire businessman Elon Musk reinstated her account after he bought the social media platform in 2022.

“As a direct result of … my relentless pressure on the [state department] and Department of Homeland Security, US officials have now moved to take action against Hamdi’s visa status, and his continued presence in this country,” Loomer posted on social media.

Hamdi is the latest of numerous immigrants who have been arrested and deported by ICE over pro-Palestinian views. Earlier in October, journalist Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador after having been detailed while live streaming the massive, anti-Trump No Kings protest in June.

On 30 September, a federal judge appointed during Ronald Reagan’s presidency ruled the administration’s policy to detain and deport foreign scholars over pro-Palestinian views violates the US constitution and was designed to “intentionally” chill free speech rights.

The ruling is bound to be appealed, possibly all the way to the US supreme court, which is dominated by a conservative supermajority made possible by three Trump appointments. The state department, meanwhile, has said it will continue revoking visas under the policy.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d72d87d05aed116a4039a4bff37bee809846a37/667_532_3436_2748/master/3436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d1f9723d879aefc060f6aa3eb0d15af",N,,2025-10-26 18:17:31.804398

The driver, a native of India who obtained a commercial driver’s license from the state of California, was found to be driving under the influence of drugs, according to the state highway patrol.

“It is a terrible tragedy three innocent people lost their lives due to the reckless open border policies that allowed an illegal alien to be released into the U.S. and drive an 18-wheeler on America’s highways,” said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This accident follows a disturbing trend of illegal aliens driving 18-wheelers and semi-trucks on America’s roads.“

She continued, “Earlier this week, DHS highlighted another fatal accident in Indiana caused by an illegal alien driving a semi-truck. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is working day-in and day-out to make America’s roads safe again.“

U.S. Transportation Secretary Duffy stated, “This is exactly why [the U.S. Department of Transportation] has withheld $40 MILLION from California for failure to comply with our rules to protect drivers. We cannot allow our roads to be a dangerous place!“

The man was allowed into the U.S. in 2022 under President Biden’s “alternatives to detention“ program.

A British Muslim journalist and political commentator, Sami Hamdi, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, officials said.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the detention, calling it an “injustice.” “Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” CAIR said.
” Why was Hamdi detained?","British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi was detained by ICE at San Francisco International Airport after his visa was revoked. Officials stated those supporting terrorism and undermining national security are barred from the US. Hamdi, editor of The International Interest, was reportedly detained due to his criticism of the Israeli government.

A British Muslim journalist and political commentator, Sami Hamdi, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, officials said. His visa was revoked, and he remains in ICE custody, according to Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote on X. She also praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for Hamdi’s removal, calling it “It’s common sense.” Hamdi is a journalist and political commentator, serving as the Editor-in-Chief of The International Interest, a magazine that covers Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and UK politics. He has also contributed articles to Al Jazeera in 2022. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the detention, calling it an “injustice.” “Earlier this morning, ICE agents abducted British Muslim journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi at San Francisco Airport, apparently in response to his vocal criticism of the Israeli government during his ongoing speaking tour,” CAIR said. “We can confirm that Mr. Hamdi has not been deported and remains in custody. Our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice.” CAIR further condemned the arrest as an attack on free speech, according to Kron4 News. “Everyone should recognise that arresting a British citizen legally visiting the United States because he dared to criticise a foreign nation’s genocide is our government’s latest blatant affront to free speech,” the organisation said. “Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel-first bigots; this is an Israel-first policy, not an America-first policy, and it must end. ”

Why was Hamdi detained?

According to RAIR Foundation USA, Hamdi has repeatedly praised attacks carried out by Hamas, including the October 7, 2023 massacre in which over 1,200 civilians were killed. He described the hostage-taking and killings as “victorious” and “merciful,” and publicly glorified the operation, reposting videos of victims. DHS officials said that such actions qualify as espousing terrorist activity and demonstrated a clear alignment with a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. Beyond his public statements, Hamdi has participated in international training programs linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, a network identified by US authorities as cultivating operatives for political and ideological influence abroad. While in the United States, he reportedly instructed audiences to destabilise support for US allies, target officials, and weaponise elections. ICE cited these activities as evidence that Hamdi was using US soil to further extremist agendas, radicalise audiences, and operate as an embedded actor for a foreign network hostile to American interests.

It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.
These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.
Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.” And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities.
As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.

The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.

An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over eight billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”

The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the US Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.

But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.

Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.

Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.

Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”

And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.

Advocates told The Lever that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.

“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”

“Tactical Intelligence” to Israel and the Pentagon

Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.

But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the US Marines and the State Department.

Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.

The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual’s online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target’s Social Security number.

“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.

This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”

Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24115300/ice-phone.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 20:56:50.929906

A Honduran migrant died following an attack by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers as part of anti-immigration actions under President Donald Trump’s administration, bringing the total number of migrants killed in similar incidents to three.

According to The Guardian, 24-year-old José Castro Rivera, a Honduran migrant, died last Thursday after a car accident while fleeing an ICE raid.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provided details on the operation but withheld information regarding Castro Rivera’s death and the status of other detained migrants.

A DHS official claimed that an ICE officer attempted CPR on Castro Rivera, but he died at the scene.

The fatal incident occurred on the busy eastbound Interstate 264 near the Military Highway interchange in Norfolk, southeastern Virginia. The Virginia State Police stated they were not involved in the chase, and the deadly accident remains under investigation.

This is the third known deadly incident involving migrants attempting to escape armed, masked federal officers—part of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrants and the unprecedented nationwide expansion of ICE operations.

In August, 52-year-old Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Guatemala was killed on a highway after fleeing an ICE raid at a warehouse roughly 32 kilometers northeast of downtown Los Angeles, California. His death came just a month after another fatal ICE operation in Southern California.

In July, 56-year-old Jaime Alanis Garcia, a Mexican farmworker, fell nine meters from a greenhouse roof while fleeing federal agents in Ventura, California. Alanis Garcia, who had lived and worked in the U.S. for nearly 30 years to support his family in Mexico, suffered catastrophic injuries and was removed from life support after two days. This incident occurred during a raid in which over 300 people were arrested.

Trump and his anti-immigration advisors repeatedly claimed that the unprecedented resources and authority given to ICE were aimed at removing so-called “illegal criminals” from U.S. streets.

However, official data show that migrants with no criminal record now constitute the largest group in U.S. immigration detention. The number of individuals without criminal records arrested and detained by ICE under Trump has surpassed the number of those accused of crimes.

Police named Jose Castro-Rivera, 24, of Honduras, as the deceased individual.

Agents were conducting a vehicle stop as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation” when the man “resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Castro-Rivera was then hit by a pickup truck on Interstate 254 at the Military Highway Interchange in Norfolk, according to Virginia State Police, who were not involved in the chase but are investigating the death.

ICE officers attempted to give the 24-year-old CPR at the scene, though he succumbed to his injuries, DHS said.

“The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased,” according to the agency. “He then grieved and prayed with them.”

A similar death occurred in August, when Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez of Guatemala died after running onto a highway in Monrovia, California, during a chase involving immigration agents.

As part of the Trump administration’s deportation push, masked agents in unmarked cars have been surged to cities around the country and have often used aggressive, raid-style tactics against crowds in public places like Home Depot parking lots. Last month, more than two-thirds of those in ICE detention had no prior criminal conviction.

In September, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner sued federal immigration officials, alleging masked officers shoved him to the ground, dogpiled on top of him, and held him without charges or medical attention for 12 hours during a raid on his business.

Earlier this month, a federal judge in Illinois temporarily barred agents from using rubber bullets, tear gas, and chemical munitions on protesters and journalists, following a lawsuit from press associations and faith leaders accusing Donald Trump’s administration of “a pattern of extreme brutality.”

At least 20 people have died in immigration detention this year, the deadliest in decades.

CHICAGO – More than 200 people participated in the 2025 Illinois Together Against Hate: Human Rights in Action Conference on Oct. 21 in Champaign, Illinois. The Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR), the Illinois Commission on Discrimination and Hate Crimes (CDHC), and the City of Champaign’s Equity & Engagement Department collaborated efforts to amplify conversations and strengthen partnerships to combat hate.

The event served as a powerful, in-person gathering for community members, civil rights advocates, and human rights professionals to share actionable tools, innovative strategies, and impactful connections that drive lasting change.

The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a leading scholar and author on extremism and radicalization, and founder of the Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University.

Attendees participated in sessions and workshops covering topics ranging from understanding discrimination protections in Illinois to emerging, evidence-based strategies for preventing hate and extremism.

Acts of hate are defined as those that target people based on their actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, citizenship, immigration status, or national origin. Hate incidents are categorized into hate crimes, bias-motivated civil rights violations, and hateful, but legal expressions.

Officials urgently call on all residents to report acts of hate through the Help Stop Hate initiative—a safe, confidential service that provides support and resources. Almost one year since the program’s launch in October 2024, it serves as a vital lifeline for survivors, offering immediate relief through anonymous reporting, trauma-informed care, and connections to services—such as legal aid—to fill gaps where traditional systems fall short.

“The spread of hate and human rights violations is inextricably bound to the erosion of our democracy,” said IDHR Director Jim Bennett. “We are seeing acts of hatred and violence compound. By convening these important conversations, we are taking practical steps to make all Illinoisans safer. We will lead by example, showing America and the world that there is another way forward—one that honors our shared humanity and rejects the politics of fear and division.”

“At a time when presidential rhetoric emboldens extremists and targets vulnerable communities, we are encouraging Illinoisans to take action by reporting all acts of hate,” said CDHC Executive Director Elana Kahn, “This conference represents a critical step forward in amplifying conversations and partnerships. By working together, residents alongside local and state leaders can move the needle on hate and take practical steps to protect our democracy.”

Help Stop Hate is a statewide priority that supports targeted individuals while informing new policies for confronting hate. However, underreported acts of hate limit the ability to prevent and respond to hate effectively. Progress hinges on support from every Illinoisan.

“Illinois is at the forefront of state efforts to counter and prevent hate and the violence that comes from it,” said Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idress. “This event comes at exactly the right time and gives me hope that the urgency and commitment Illinois brings to this issue will shine a light for the rest of the country.”

Help Stop Hate allows Illinoisans to report acts of hate safely and anonymously, with no affiliation to law enforcement or immigration authorities. Personal information will only be shared with law enforcement if legally required and will never be shared with immigration agencies.

Illinoisans can report online to Help Stop Hate anytime in seven languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Mandarin, Tagalog, Arabic or Hindi. The phone line is open between noon and 9 p.m. CT, Monday to Friday, to English and Spanish speakers. Additional translation services are arranged as needed.

Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called “Freaky Friday,” offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans — many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It’s a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I’m more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it’s easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I’m not happy with my country.

“It’s like they’re not compromising. They’re not coming to a happy medium. They’re just combative. And that’s all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an “extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for stanching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him — or other lawyers — to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system’s gotten a lot faster. When it’s come to helping people, the system’s gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.

Yolanda wants to see Fullerton support immigration and believes it is essential for the city to do so.
The newly established Fullerton Community Foundation aims to do good work and could be a great avenue for this support.","During the City Council meeting, Deputy City Manager Daisy Perez presented on the recent federal immigration enforcement actions impacting residents in Fullerton. Council Member Zahra, supported by Mayor Pro Tem Charles, requested the addition of an agenda item to explore ways the city could assist individuals affected by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. The council was also interested in reviewing actions taken by other jurisdictions, specifically Costa Mesa, to identify potential strategies applicable to Fullerton.

The meeting focused on evaluating how the city could support residents impacted by recent ICE activities and assessing the approaches taken by other cities. The presentation highlighted existing policies, regional contexts, and various options available for the City Council’s consideration.

Fullerton complies with the California Values Act, Senate Bill 54, which restricts local law enforcement’s involvement in federal immigration enforcement. The Fullerton Police Department does not engage in civil immigration enforcement and adheres to policies in accordance with state law. Additionally, the City offers public resources through its website, including Immigration Enforcement and Immigration Information pages, along with a Police Department resource page. These resources feature bilingual materials that connect residents with legal and community service providers.

In response to recent immigration enforcement activities in Southern California, various jurisdictions have been reviewing their policies to find ways to support residents while complying with state and federal laws. Common strategies among those cities included public education, community partnerships, and coordination with nonprofit organizations that provide legal and humanitarian assistance.

The City Council, during its meeting, voted 4-0-1 (with Dunlap absent) to direct staff to prepare and submit an amicus brief in coordination with other local jurisdictions regarding the case of Perdomo, et al. v. Noem, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. This case challenged the legality of “roving patrols” by federal immigration enforcement agencies, claiming that such practices could lead to detentions without reasonable suspicion. The City intended to participate in the amicus brief to support constitutional due process and fair enforcement practices consistent with established law.

On August 29, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a temporary restraining order, allowing the federal government to resume immigration enforcement operations at public locations such as bus stops, car washes, and home improvement stores while litigation continued.

Regionally, cities have focused on several key actions:

Public education and outreach,

Partnerships with nonprofits and legal aid organizations,

Funding programs for humanitarian or legal support, and

Policy resolutions reaffirming local values and compliance with state law.

Based on these regional examples, Fullerton considered several options for moving forward. One option was to continue existing outreach and education efforts through the City’s website and the Police Department. Another option involved partnering with nonprofits or legal aid organizations to provide localized support. Furthermore, the City could explore developing funding or policy initiatives based on successful models from neighboring jurisdictions.

City staff sought direction from the council on whether to maintain current practices or pursue new initiatives. Should the city council choose to continue with informational outreach, minimal costs could be absorbed within existing departmental budgets. However, any new programs, such as legal aid partnerships or additional funding assistance, could require the use of city discretionary funds, including local discretionary or general funds. This might involve reallocating funds from the general fund contingency or special event accounts, a step taken by other cities in similar situations. It is important to note that federal and other restricted funds, such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME funds, cannot be utilized for these purposes.

At the public comments for this item 30 people spoke in favor of helping immigrant families who have endured trauma from the ICE raides. One person spoke against helping the immigrant community. And there was one AI phone call that was also against helping.

After the city council members deliberated, the item passed with a vote of 3 to 2 (Jung and Dunlap voted NO). This item will be discussed at a future city council meeting.

Public Comments

Patty Tudor: I’m a planning commissioner, but I am speaking as a resident today. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about the people affected by the recent actions taken by ICE. I want to help those who are struggling and provide mutual aid in any way I can. However, I have found it challenging to connect with a group that can guide me on the right support to offer. I imagine many of you in this room share that same difficulty.

I believe it would be beneficial for Fullerton to take the lead on organizing efforts like this, as it would make it easier for all of us to provide assistance to the residents in our city who need help. Therefore, I urge you to create a space for those of us who want to help so that we can effectively support our community. Thank you.

Laura Cook: I want to speak from the heart about my experience living in Fullerton. You will likely hear many stories about the trauma caused by ICE raids, and I’ve shared my thoughts on that in a previous meeting as well. However, my experience in Fullerton has been that it’s a town filled with neighbors who care for one another.

During the formula shortage in the pandemic, complete strangers from my Buy Nothing group were texting each other to help find formula for babies and dropping it off on porches. This summer, when the ICE raids created a similar atmosphere of fear and uncertainty for many families, people came together to support one another. Neighbors, friends, and even strangers bought groceries and delivered them to those in need, and they dropped off toys for kids who were stuck at home and bored during the summer.

My experience in Fullerton is that it’s fundamentally a community of neighbors who believe in helping each other. On a personal note, my brother served in the military for 13 years and died in a war zone. As a Gold Star sibling, I know that the America he fought for is one where we help our neighbors and offer asylum to those in need. I believe he would echo these sentiments tonight, and I know that many people in Fullerton would agree.

We want to take care of our neighbors, and it’s important to do that. Financially, I believe we can make strong moral and ethical choices with our budget. If you sat down with most Fullerton residents, I am confident they would say that helping each other is the right thing to do.

Malika Contado: I have lived in Fullerton for 35 years since immigrating with my family to the United States from the Philippines when I was three years old. I am here today because I love Fullerton and am proud to call it my home. However, for many of our immigrant neighbors, including myself, home may not feel safe or secure. Immigrants make up almost 30% of our city’s population—28.7% to be precise. I’m rounding that up to illustrate my point.

This evening, I am asking you to commit to building a Fullerton where everyone belongs. I appreciate the presentation given today and believe we can do more to ensure that immigrants feel safe, supported, and empowered to thrive in the community they already love.

Across Orange County, our neighbors are demonstrating what is possible. For instance, Santa Ana funds universal immigration legal defense so that no resident faces deportation alone. Anaheim has created “Welcoming Anaheim,” joining a national network that measures inclusion and allocates real funds to address immigrant needs. We should follow their lead. Costa Mesa has publicly confirmed that its police do not participate in immigration enforcement, which helps build trust between residents and officers. These are not partisan gestures; they are practical strategies for community safety that strengthen our neighborhoods and families.

My nieces are here; they are second-generation Pacific Drive Dolphins. I want them to feel safe and to experience childhood without fear of what might happen around their school. Fullerton can take similar steps by launching a “Belonging First Fullerton” initiative. As a resident, I can dream alongside you.

We could create a small immigrant legal defense fund, possibly sourced from the $6.3 million discretionary fund in our general budget. This fund could be modeled after Santa Ana’s established microgrants—around $200,000—to help families stay housed during immigration crises, thus lessening the trauma these events cause.

I also propose adopting a welcoming resolution affirming that everyone, regardless of origin or immigration status, should feel welcome in our city and that they belong here. When people feel safe in their neighborhoods, when they feel safe calling 911, sending their kids to school, or opening businesses, our entire city benefits.

Belonging is not just a feeling; it’s a practice that we can build together. I will hold our council members accountable to this vision.

Vanessa Estrella: I am a proud trustee for the Fullerton School District, a mother, a small business owner, and a resident of District 5 in Fullerton. In my role, I see how family well-being and student success are intertwined. When a parent faces detention, deportation, or eviction, that pain doesn’t stay at home; it follows children into the classroom.

Just this past August, a Fullerton family with three young children—two of whom attend our local schools—found themselves at risk of deportation after escaping violence in their home country. They are currently here under asylum, yet their future remains uncertain. Local partners have stepped up to raise legal funds and provide temporary housing to keep the family safe and together.

These stories make it clear that good intentions and volunteer efforts aren’t enough; families need structural support. That’s why I am here, asking this council to set aside funding to support immigrant families through legal aid, family assistance, and fair housing protections. Other cities, such as Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already shown what is possible here in Fullerton. We can do the same by directing resources to trusted community partners who already serve our families.

If the city isn’t ready to build new programs from scratch, it can strengthen existing ones by funding local organizations that are already doing this important work, like Amino Immigration Services, which provides legal defense, deportation support, and family assistance. These institutions exist here in Fullerton, and they deserve our investment.

According to Data USA, nearly 30% of Fullerton residents were born outside of the United States, and almost half of our students come from immigrant households. Immigrant families power our schools, our businesses, and our community life, and their economic contributions are undeniable. The California Immigrant Data Portal reports that immigrant households across California contribute over $51 billion in state and local taxes, $81 billion in federal taxes, and hold more than $354 billion in spending power.

When we invest in the safety and stability of immigrant families, we invest in Fullerton’s economy and in our city’s future. So tonight, I urge you to take compassionate and practical action to ensure that every family, regardless of status, feels safe in our community. A strong city, like a strong school district, is built on belonging, and belonging means knowing your community is there for you.

Jennifer Garcia: I am a resident and pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton. I wanted to bring to your attention that either last weekend or this weekend would typically be the time for Saint Mary’s Carnival and Festival, which has been held at Ambridge Park every year for as long as I can remember. However, this year, they decided not to hold the event due to concerns from many of their neighbors about attending.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a cherished gift to our community being lost because of fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival to protect their most vulnerable community members—those living in heightened fear. This situation underscores the severity of the current crisis.

I serve on our county’s Continuum of Care board, and something interesting happened about a month ago. City managers from the North Service Planning Area (NOCSPA), which includes the 11 cities in North Orange County, attended our Continuum of Care board meeting to request funding. I found myself at the opposite end of the diocese, reviewing their funding requests.

Jason Phillips: I’m a resident and a pastor at Sojourners Church in Fullerton. I wanted to bring to your attention that either last weekend or this weekend would typically be the time for Saint Mary’s Carnival and Festival, which has been held every year for as long as I can remember at Ambridge Park. However, this year, they decided not to hold the event. This decision was made because many of their neighbors were afraid to attend.

It’s disheartening to see something that has been a gift to our entire community being lost due to fear. They made this difficult decision to forgo the festival for the sake of their most vulnerable community members—those living with the greatest fear. This situation emphasizes how deep the current crisis is.

Darlene Ruiz: I am an eighth grader at Ladera Vista Junior High School of the Arts. Immigration services have devastated many Hispanic families by causing fear, family separation, and barriers to jobs, housing, and healthcare. Children often experience trauma when their parents are detained, and many avoid seeking help due to their legal status.

Fortunately, there are many resources available, such as Races United, We Dream, Catholic Charities, and the National Immigration Law Center. In the Pledge of Allegiance, it says “justice for all,” but where is the justice in this country?

What has helped my family and me the most is solidarity. Solidarity has significantly impacted our community since 2012. We appreciate all the staff members who have been and continue to be a part of this effort. They have not only offered help but have also changed many lives.

So, we come here to ask for your support in creating an immigration aid fund.

Stacey: I also attend Ladera Vista Junior High School. The involvement of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has profoundly affected my family and me, shaping our lives with fear, uncertainty, and disruption. The constant threat of deportation has led to ongoing psychological trauma for us. This situation has limited our ability to fully participate in opportunities at work, school, and within our community.

These pressures have created financial and social instability, undermining our sense of security and belonging on a personal level. The emotional toll has been immeasurable, as the fear of family separation weighs heavily on our daily lives.

From a broader perspective, our experience reflects the systemic impact of immigration enforcement policies that disproportionately burden families. These policies leave lasting consequences on mental health, economic stability, and overall well-being.

Therefore, we ask for your assistance in creating an immigration aid fund here in the city of Fullerton.

Julia Aviles: I’ve lived in Fullerton since I was about four years old, and I’m now 17 and a senior at Fullerton Union High School. Although I haven’t been directly affected, the situation impacts my elders and my community, including my family. I can’t help but feel empathy for them as I watch them live in a constant state of paranoia and suffer financially.

Southern California has a significant immigrant population, which plays a crucial role in economic activity. Immigrant-run businesses create a home-like environment and foster a sense of security. Without these businesses, there are neither consumers nor producers, which disrupts the community. With many of these businesses closing down and ICE enforcement being an ongoing threat, many immigrants are forced to either stay home or risk deportation if they venture out.

I had to stay indoors for a couple of months without the ability to work and earn money, while some of my family members had to sell personal belongings to get by. I know they endured great hardship during this difficult time, both emotionally and financially.

Additionally, most of my family members are immigrants, and I can see how uncomfortable they feel going out, even to places like the corner store. This issue affects me personally as I witness their struggles and anxiety. It would mean a lot to me and my loved ones if you could support the creation of immigration aid funds.

Julia Crosby: I am a freshman at Fullerton Union High School, raised in Fullerton my whole life. My family, like many others, suffers from the impact of ICE enforcement in our community. Events are being canceled, and the fear of ICE is making it hard for people to enjoy time outdoors with their families.

For instance, my grandma can only go outside at night because she feels unsafe during the day. She no longer shops in person and must order everything online, which limits her freedom and joy.

We urge the mayor and the council to support initiatives that help immigrant families feel safe and included in our community. Fullerton is our home, and everyone deserves to live without fear. To thrive, we must ensure that our community is safe and welcoming for all.

Alejandro Delgado: I was born in Pomona but moved to Fullerton, where I have lived my whole life. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. Right now, in Fullerton and across Orange County, many families are living in fear. Parents worry that a normal day could end in separation, and kids go to school wondering if their family will still be together when they get home. This fear spreads, affecting our schools, neighborhoods, and the trust that keeps our community strong.

For many of us, home means more than just a place to live; it means safety, dignity, and stability. However, for too many families here, that sense of home feels uncertain. Other cities in Orange County have already taken action. In Santa Ana, a program called Frontera, which means “Hope without Borders,” offers legal defense and direct help for families. Costa Mesa set up a $200,000 legal aid fund to help families stay in their homes, and Anaheim added $250,000 to its immigrant aid fund to assist families with rent and utilities when a loved one is detained. These cities are demonstrating what compassion looks like in action, reminding us that when we invest in people, we build strong communities.

Fullerton has the chance to do the same. Instead of viewing our city’s budget as limited, we can see it as a tool for abundance—a way to express what we value most. Our budget is more than just numbers; it’s a reflection of our priorities. Let’s choose to invest in safety, stability, and dignity for every family. Let’s choose hope over fear and abundance over scarcity. Let’s work to make Fullerton a city where every person truly feels at home. As someone who will be voting in the next election, I hope you will make the right decision for our community.

Kate: I work for Solidity NPO, a nonprofit organization that offers an after-school program. I also serve as the Youth Director at One Life City Church. Recently, we heard from some of the teams that participate in our program. It’s important to note that these young people represent the next voters, contributors, leaders, and activists in our city. They are actively contributing, advocating, and sharing their voices as they live, work, and play in our communities. We urge you to listen to their voices and the voices of others present today, particularly in support of the creation of the Immigration Aid Fund.

In recent months, our community has faced trauma as we witnessed our loved ones living in fear, being homebound, and targeted by those in charge who are supposed to serve the public good. Many of us have sought ways to help and have turned to one another for support through organizations and grassroots relationships that embody belonging, safety, and love.

Today, we believe that you, as the City of Fullerton and as the City Council, have an invaluable role in making our city safe, stable, and accountable to the residents who live here—just as we are accountable to you.

In recent conversations with the youth about what has happened in the past months, I’ve heard stories of heartbreak and limited ways of living. People who came here seeking better lives have faced violent incidents. One student shared that their friend’s church was raided by ICE, and their grandmother was taken. They expressed, “I liked that grandma too.” Another student mentioned that their family used to go out more, taking their kids places like the beach during the summer. However, due to these raids, they have had to remain indoors.

In a world filled with distrust and targeting, we must consider, what are we teaching our kids? Fullerton has an opportunity to address these gaps and show support in tangible ways. Hardworking families have found themselves unemployed and lacking resources, often leaving their young adults or teens to bear responsibilities that they should never have had to shoulder. This is the reality we are facing.

We ask that Fullerton follows the example set by Costa Mesa, Santa Ana, and other cities that have taken action. We strongly urge the council to establish a legal aid fund—a direct aid fund—to support our immigrant brothers, sisters, and neighbors, and to help make Fullerton feel like home.

Bianca: I live in District 3 of Fullerton, and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton as well as a volunteer with the Orange County Rapid Response Network. I am the child of two Asian immigrants. When my parents came to this country, all they wanted was a home, and they found one here in Orange County. A home is a place of belonging—it’s where you rest, where you have the support of loved ones around you. My parents found that home.

However, today, many others are losing theirs. Families are being torn apart, and children are being separated from their parents. When ICE detains a person, they are not just taking someone away; they are disrupting a home and tearing apart the fabric of a family.

I witnessed an incident that illustrates this reality. I saw ICE officers pull their vans into a lot in front of a building. One officer turned to their partner and asked, “Do you think we have enough booster seats?” Just then, a mother came out of the building, holding two young children in her arms, both of whom couldn’t have been older than two. They entered the van in silence, and the officers drove away. This is the harsh reality of what ICE does.

Home is not just a physical structure; it is made up of people and love. Fullerton can be a home, but the individuals who contribute to that sense of community are being ripped away, pushed into a system that has never cared for them.

Council members, you have the power to make a difference. We urge you to support organizations that are doing vital work and need funding. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already established legal aid funds, providing over $200,000 to support their residents. We can do the same.

In addition, families left behind when a breadwinner is taken by ICE need support. Losing a primary income can leave a family in financial distress. Establishing a direct aid fund could mean the difference between a child having dinner the night their parent is taken and going without. We ask you to consider creating this fund.

Brandy Morales: I’m a lead organizer with the Orange County Congregations Community Organization, also known as OCCCO. We focus on developing grassroots leaders to create systemic change, aiming to build communities where everyone can live with dignity and thrive. More importantly, I am a single Latina mother and a lifelong resident of Fullerton, currently in District 4. Fullerton has always been my home because of the diverse immigrant community in which I grew up.

I’m here today to ask that you allocate funding to support immigrant families who have been impacted by the recent ICE raids that occurred a few months ago. During one of the healing circles we held here in Fullerton, a young girl approached me after a session and asked, “What if one of my parents, or both, get detained? What happens then?” Her question broke my heart and made me realize how unprepared we are as a community.

Our community needs more than just lawsuits or statements of support; they need security, stability, and, most importantly, a sense of unconditional belonging. At that moment, all I could do was hand her a few phone numbers, but I wondered if that was enough. I didn’t think so.

I began to ask myself: What if I were detained? Or if one of my loved ones were detained? Could I afford it? Who would take care of my children? I reflected on this because ICE is targeting anyone who fits their stereotype of what an immigrant looks like, and my loved ones and I fit that description.

Imagine if I could tell that young girl, “Our city sees you. Our city has a plan.” Imagine if she knew that Fullerton was investing in families like ours. Our city budget is a moral document; it should reflect our values and support the people who make this city strong and diverse.

So today, I am asking you to invest in our immigrant community and allocate funds for families impacted by ICE enforcement. Thank you, and I pray that you choose to acknowledge the pain and fear that has affected our immigrant communities.

Kathy Plate: I’m a homeowner in Fullerton, and my wife and I are raising two kids who are attending Rolling Hills and the Fullerton School District. I want to emphasize that our community is only whole when everyone feels welcome, safe, and that they belong, especially at the beginning of the school year.

While many families were preparing for back-to-school season, I became aware that some families in our city were unable to drop their kids off at school due to fear of detention. I know our school district is doing everything it can to serve our students and families, but there are larger issues that our schools alone can’t address. I believe it’s time for this council to step up and do more.

The impact we’ve seen from fears of separation, the effects on employment, and the stories shared tonight are significant—much more than what one part of our community can handle. I hope we can partner with the nonprofits here tonight to come up with solutions. As a parent, I strive to ensure our home is a sanctuary and a place of trust and safety—not just for my kids, but also for their friends, our neighbors, and the larger community.

One way we do this is by teaching our kids to make good choices. They’re still learning, as am I, that it’s important to share—whether it’s toys or snacks—and to invite others to play and not exclude anyone. We remind them of their school motto to be kind, safe, and responsible beyond our home.

Fullerton is our larger home, and everyone in our city deserves to feel like they belong and that they are cared for with dignity and safety. No one should feel that they need to stay confined to their house. The city budget should reflect these values.

Our neighboring cities in Orange County, such as Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Costa Mesa, have already stepped up, and I urge the council to do the same. I propose that we establish a legal aid fund so that every resident has access to due process and legal representation. We should also create a direct aid fund for families who may be struggling with rent, food, and essential needs, as well as protect tenants from unjust evictions.

Home should be a place of belonging for all of our immigrant neighbors. I hope the council can make wise choices, be kind, safe, and responsible, and recognize the importance of funding initiatives that ensure our city is a place where everyone can thrive.

Elliot Chung: I serve as one of the pastors at One Life City Church, and I am proud to be a resident of District 5. As a pastor, husband, and father, I speak on behalf of my congregation and my family to emphasize that Filipinos are part of a community where everyone belongs. When one of us is in fear or in need, the whole community feels it.

We are here out of compassion—as citizens, friends, and neighbors of this beautiful city. We have witnessed the impact that ICE raids have had on our immigrant neighbors: families who are part of our schools, our churches, our small businesses, and our friendships. In my Korean culture, there is a term that embodies this kind of love and kinship, which holds a community together. It’s called “jeom” (점) I have reflected on this word recently, as it signifies the deep connection among people—love expressed through presence, shared meals, and simply being there for one another.

This is a love that doesn’t require words to be genuine. I also see “jeom” (점) in my Christian faith when I hear Jesus say, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” This kind of love is not merely sentimental; it is practical. It nourishes, shelters, and protects. It reminds us that every person, including you, me, and every immigrant family in this city, is made in the image of God. Just as Esau recognized Jacob in their reconciled relationship, we need to see each other, for in seeing one another, we see the face of God.

Many cities have already addressed this current brokenness by allocating funds in their budgets. They have responded with love and compassion. Even my small church has managed to set aside funds to assist our neighbors in Maple and Richmond. By God’s grace, we have been able to support 17 families, distributing over $9,000. I mention this not to boast, but to demonstrate that while our little fund is a start, it is just a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.

Though we may have limited resources, including a building that has cockroaches and no grass, we chose to create a mutual aid fund because the times demand it. I believe Fullerton can do the same. Therefore, I urge this council to establish some form of legal aid fund, a direct assistance fund, or a rental registry to protect our neighbors, congregants, friends, and family.

Fullerton is our home, and it is where love and “jeom” (점) can be made visible. It is where we can truly embody what it means to love our neighbor as ourselves. I encourage you to lead with that kind of care and love, building a city where no one has to live in fear.

Debbie Langenbacher: Deborah Longenbach: Before I begin, I want to congratulate all the young people who have had the courage to come forward and share their stories. It takes a lot of bravery, and although you may not see it, the smiles on their faces and the pride they feel when they return to their seats is truly heartwarming. Thank you all for that.

My name is Deborah Longenbach, and I have been a resident of Fullerton for 25 years. I am also a member of the Unitarian Universalist congregation, and I am here to represent my fellow congregants. We, Unitarian Universalists, adhere to a set of principles that include the inherent worth and dignity of every person, justice, equity, and compassion in human relations. We are committed to building a diverse and multicultural beloved community that actively addresses issues such as racism and oppression, both within ourselves and within our institutions.

We are currently living in a time when racism and oppression are rampant in our city. ICE raids in Fullerton have primarily impacted the Latino community, leaving families fearful of leaving their homes in case they encounter ICE agents. Children are afraid to attend school, worried that their parents may not be there when they return home. None of us desire this situation—nobody in this room wants it.

Fullerton is our home, and we must work as a city to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone, to the extent that we can. Our small congregation is doing what we can, but we are few in number. We urge the city of Fullerton to take action and do its part.

Recently, Costa Mesa, a city with a smaller population than Fullerton, established a legal aid fund of $200,000 to assist immigrant families in their community. As you may have heard, Anaheim and Santa Ana have similar initiatives. These actions reflect a commitment to justice, equity, and compassion in those communities while addressing concerns related to racism and oppression.

How can Fullerton do the same? How can we ensure that Fullerton truly becomes a home for marginalized communities? How can we set an example for other communities in Orange County as a city that supports all its residents—everyone who calls Fullerton home?

Vixon in Spanish: Buenas noches, miembros del Consejo. Esta noche les hablaré en español porque es crucial dirigirnos a nuestras familias y residentes inmigrantes, especialmente a aquellos que hablan español y se han visto afectados por las redadas de ICE.

Hablar en su idioma es una muestra de respeto y garantiza que nuestras voces se escuchen con claridad y propósito. Me llamo Vixen y estoy aquí como orgullosa miembro de la comunidad de Fullerton, apoyando a las familias afectadas por las redadas de ICE. Me acompaña mi colega, Steven Acevedo, quien también hablará sobre la realidad de nuestra situación.

El 3 de octubre, Steven fue atropellado dos veces por un vehículo de inmigración. En lugar de investigar este uso de la fuerza y proteger los derechos de un miembro de la comunidad, la policía de Anaheim optó por ignorar la situación. En lugar de defender a nuestros residentes, optaron por proteger a una agencia federal con un largo historial de causar daños a las comunidades inmigrantes. Este no es un incidente aislado; forma parte de un patrón preocupante. Nuestra comunidad ha sido vigilada, discriminada y perjudicada no solo por ICE, sino también por la complicidad y el silencio de los sistemas locales que deberían protegernos.

Quiero dejar claro que todos los residentes de nuestra comunidad tienen el derecho legal de observar y registrar las acciones de ICE para garantizar nuestra seguridad y rendición de cuentas durante estas redadas. Este tipo de observación debe ser pacífica y está protegida por la ley.

Les instamos a tomar dos medidas importantes. En primer lugar, solicitamos que el Departamento de Policía de Fullerton aclare clara y públicamente su protocolo con respecto a ICE y cómo se relaciona con el derecho de los residentes a observar y registrar legalmente las acciones. En segundo lugar, solicitamos al Ayuntamiento que cree y apruebe un fondo para apoyar a las familias afectadas por redadas y deportaciones. Cuando se lleva a uno de los padres sin previo aviso, toda la familia, incluidos los niños y los ancianos, sufre.

Por último, quiero recordarles a los miembros del consejo que tienen el poder de actuar en este asunto. Por favor, decidan ayudar a nuestros residentes y proteger a nuestras familias. Gracias.

Vixon in English: Good evening, Council members. I will be speaking in Spanish tonight because it is crucial to address our immigrant families and residents—especially those who speak Spanish and have been affected by ICE raids.

Speaking in your language is a sign of respect, and it ensures that our voices are heard with clarity and purpose. My name is Vixen, and I am here as a proud member of the Fullerton community, standing in support of families impacted by the ICE raids. I am joined by my colleague, Steven Acevedo, who will also speak about the truth of our situation.

On October 3, Steven was struck twice by an immigration enforcement vehicle. Instead of investigating this use of force and protecting the rights of a community member, the Anaheim police chose to look the other way. Rather than defending our residents, they opted to protect a federal agency with a long history of causing harm to immigrant communities. This is not an isolated incident; it is part of a troubling pattern. Our community has been surveilled, profiled, and harmed not only by ICE but also by the complicity and silence of local systems that should be protecting us.

I want to make it clear that every resident in our community has the legal right to observe and record ICE actions to ensure our safety and accountability during these raids. This kind of observation should be peaceful and is protected by law.

We urge you to take two important actions. Firstly, we request that the Fullerton Police Department clearly and publicly clarify its protocol regarding ICE and how it relates to residents’ rights to observe and record actions legally. Secondly, we ask the City Council to create and approve a fund to support families impacted by raids and deportations. When one parent is taken away without prior notice, the entire family—including children and elders—suffers.

Lastly, I want to remind our council members that you have the power to act on this issue. Please choose to help our residents and protect our families. Thank you.

Bethany Anderson: I want to share something important that I personally witnessed. Just two weeks ago, I overheard a conversation between ICE officers in the office, where one officer asked another, “What’s up, killer? You out there disappearing people for us?” This exchange clearly highlights the troubling atmosphere surrounding immigration enforcement.

My name is Bethany Anderson, and I am the Executive Director of Solidarity and Communal Immigration Services, a nonprofit organization that has been serving the Fullerton community for over 20 years. As an expert and practitioner of immigration law, I can tell you that what we are witnessing in our community and across the country reflects the worst aspects of humanity. We see businesses under siege, and innocent individuals tackled to the ground based on their skin color and the language they speak. This includes U.S. citizens, as I personally observed during a raid at a car wash in Anaheim just last Thursday.

Furthermore, our legal immigration system is being dismantled, leading to a growing number of undocumented immigrants daily. This crisis affects many hardworking individuals in our city who are striving to obtain legal status. The vast majority have no criminal records and live in mixed-status families, including immediate family members who are U.S. citizens. We are officially in a crisis situation.

As someone who runs an immigration legal service organization, one of the few dedicated to helping the Fullerton community, I can assure you that the need for financial support for our residents is overwhelming. This support is essential for accessing legal services, covering rent, and providing direct aid. Just yesterday, I spoke with a local woman whose husband was kidnapped off the street last Thursday. As a result, she is now worried about how she will pay rent this month. Her husband has lived here for over 20 years, has no criminal record, and is the father of three U.S. citizen children. She is concerned about how she will feed her children and continue to support her child with special needs.

As a community, we are doing everything we can. We have raised funds for rent and groceries for our neighbors, accompanied individuals to court and check-ins, and provided emotional support for one another. However, our efforts alone are not enough. We need a larger, collective initiative to make a meaningful impact.

As I mentioned earlier, we are witnessing the worst of humanity right now, but this also presents an opportunity for us to show the best of humanity. I invite each of you to join us in our collective effort to care for our city, our home, and our community in a significant way. By creating this fund, as I said during my last visit, we are at a crucial point in our legacy as individuals and as a city. Let us come together and be on the right side of history. Thank you.

Danny: I am part of the OCR network, and we help monitor ICE operations legally, as my partner has mentioned before. I have been at Fullerton College for about four years, pursuing different degrees. I’m here because our community is only whole when every neighbor belongs, especially those who are most targeted and vulnerable. No one should ever have to fear going to school, grocery shopping, or simply walking outside. People are being taken off the streets without any judicial or deportation orders. This affects every family, not just undocumented immigrants. The separations caused by these actions, along with their ripple effects on housing, schools, and the community, should be thoroughly studied.

I want to emphasize that home means more than just shelter; it represents safety, dignity, and stability. Other cities, like Santa Ana, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, have already taken action. Santa Ana has the Help Without Borders program, which provides both legal defense and direct family assistance. Costa Mesa has established a $200,000 legal aid fund and is exploring a rental registry to keep families housed, which I encourage our council to consider. Anaheim recently added $250,000 to its Immigrant Aid Fund to help families pay rent and utilities when their loved ones are detained.

I urge the council to establish legal aid funds for all residents to ensure they have access to due process and legal representation. We need to create a direct aid fund to support families left behind with rent, food, and essential needs. Additionally, exploring a rental registry could help keep tenants stable and prevent unjust evictions.

Earlier, we recited the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes an amendment stating that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by a grand jury. No one should be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themselves, nor should they be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. I want to emphasize the phrase “no person,” as it does not specify “citizen.”

Our budget should not be immoral and should not be merely sentimental; it must be strategic. It should prevent harm, support families, and build trust between residents and their government. We are human beings, and every individual deserves a place of belonging. Home is where we feel safe, where we flourish, and where we practice mutual care. Belonging means more than just accommodation. It consists of cherishing and valuing the contributions that every individual, family, and community brings to our city as a whole.

Steven Acevedo: Imagine being struck by a vehicle not once, but twice, by a federal agent, and having your cries for justice ignored by those sworn to protect you. This is not just an isolated incident; it is a glaring example of the systemic failures that continue to put our community at risk. I stand before you not only as someone who has been wronged, but also as a voice for all of us who have been failed by the very institutions meant to protect us. I am here to advocate for accountability, transparency, and justice.

My name is Steven Acevedo, and I was struck by a federal agent twice. On October 3rd, 2025, an ICE agent hit me with their vehicle. I never expected this to happen to me. I never imagined that someone in a position of authority would use their vehicle as a weapon. But that is exactly what transpired. And what did the police do? They turned a blind eye; they chose to protect the federal agent instead of seeking justice for me, the victim, a community member and an American citizen.

Instead of upholding the law and ensuring accountability, the police disregarded the very principles they are supposed to serve. The police should be here to protect citizens, to serve and defend us. Instead, they sided with ICE — an agency known for instilling fear and division rather than fostering safety and community trust. ICE agents are not here to protect our communities; they are here to terrorize. They enforce policies that not only instill fear but also tear families apart and create anxiety in our neighborhoods.

This is not the kind of protection we need in our city. What we need is accountability and transparency. The actions of the police and federal agents cannot go unchecked. We cannot permit a system in which the abuse of power is ignored, where the rights of American citizens are trampled, and where there is no accountability for actions that harm us all. It is up to us to demand better — to demand a police department that truly serves the community and a system in which federal agents are held accountable for their actions.

We will not stand idly by while our rights are ignored and violated, and while our safety is jeopardized. We must hold our leaders accountable, advocate for transparency, and ensure that justice is served. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can ensure that those who are meant to protect us are held to the highest standards of accountability. This is our city, and we will stand for justice. Thank you.

Todd Harrison is speaking on behalf of his wife, Yolanda Harrison, who is suffering from laryngitis. She expressed her frustration by writing, “Laryngitis sucks.” Yolanda has been typing tirelessly for the last hour to share her thoughts.

As an immigrant, she wanted to attend the No Kings event, but chose to stay home because she has lost her voice. Her husband is concerned about her safety due to the potential implications for her immigration process. Yolanda expressed pride in everyone who stood up for the No Kings initiative, even though she understands the risks her words might pose.

She reflected on her grandfathers, who both lived through difficult times in 1949. They did not endure their suffering so that future generations would face similar challenges. Yolanda wants to see Fullerton support immigration and believes it is essential for the city to do so.

She would like to see a hard copy of all organizations that can assist immigrants, especially for those updating their status safely and in compliance with regulations. There have been incidents of immigrants being detained during their hearings, which terrifies her. Having printed resources is crucial because they can be distributed like the red cards given out during the first No Kings event. Relying solely on online information is inadequate when there is no Internet access.

Yolanda is not only fearful for her own safety, but also for her husband’s and anyone else who is an immigrant or appears to be one. She worries about what may happen once immigrants are no longer targeted—will they go after other marginalized groups next, like those identified by pink triangles or yellow stars?

She emphasizes the importance of remembering that today’s immigrants could be tomorrow’s voters. There is much more she wants to say.

Todd Harrison: Yes, I’m an American citizen. I was born in a hospital in Manhattan. Doctor Charles and I share something important: we each have two Jewish grandmothers. I had a wonderful mother, and before she passed away, she was a strong influence in my life. Additionally, I share something else with at least three-fifths of the City Council: either I, my parents, or my grandparents were immigrants at some point in our history. We can trace our roots back to various groups, whether it’s the Chinese immigrants who built the railroads through the Rockies or Ahmad and his relatives from Syria, and Doctor Charles with her long line of ancestors.

When I was 11 years old, after returning to New York from living in Europe, I was introduced to an elderly uncle of mine who had numbers tattooed on his forearm. Now, we see that Nazis are resurfacing, trying to divide our country by race and beliefs, and tearing our communities apart. I believe all residents and officials of Fullerton owe it to our shared heritage—not just for those around us today, but for our ancestors—to fight against this division. We must support each other in every possible way because it truly does not matter what makes someone stand out; anyone could become a target next.

Current events have shown us that there is no limit to the atrocities that prejudice can inflict. I even wrote to my wife so she could respond while we were sitting here together. I hate to say this, but I am concerned about your visibility in a public forum with your green card up for review. This is how they win—by silencing us.

I won’t go into the entire history, but we all know the saying: they came for others, and I did not speak up. Anyone who has been to school is probably familiar with that, and it remains true today. Therefore, regardless of the risks, we must all speak up and act in support of one another. Thank you.

Diane Kurtzman: I am a lifelong resident of North Orange County, having grown up over the hill in La Habra and spent the last 21 years in Fullerton. For the past 15 years, I’ve lived in our vibrant downtown, and I love the joyful noise that comes with it, as many of us do. A significant part of my appreciation for this lively public square stems from my German Jewish grandparents, who hid their identities in the United States for fear of being targeted, as their family members had been in Germany. My great-grandmother used to call me “Anka,” the same nickname as Anne Frank.

I was raised to be quiet, to know how to hide, and to be hyper-vigilant. Now, as a parent of a beautiful, fierce preteen son and twin daughters, I find myself not only worried about how to protect my children from the violent, indiscriminate kidnappings being carried out by secret police, which leave them weeping and terrified, but also actively engaging in community support. I take groceries to the families of my children’s classmates who can’t leave their homes, and I walk children to school because their parents can’t get them there safely.

As grassroots organizers and first responders, we cannot do this alone. We need your assistance to access funds that we would like to use to support our neighbors—your constituents. I urge you to allocate at least $200,000, like Costa Mesa did, to established organizations such as Camino and Gription Services to assist with legal aid and create a direct aid fund. We are all contributing our money to help, and we would appreciate having some of our tax dollars returned to support these efforts.

As others have mentioned, there are many places where this funding can be sourced. Additionally, as a side note, anyone who speaks a language other than English knows that Google Translate on the website is not a sufficient option; we can and should do better. Please do not be the ones who look the other way when the Gestapo came for their neighbors.

Next speaker. Good evening. All people in our Fullerton community are beloved and include our neighbors, families, friends, co-workers, colleagues, employers, and employees. The important word here is “all,” which encompasses everyone, including immigrants. Communities should help and take care of everyone, which is why I urge the council to approve measures that the City of Fullerton can take to support those impacted by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities.

People are afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or participate in daily life. Children are scared to go to school, fearing that their parents will disappear. I recently attended an important forum sponsored by Mayor Pro Tem Charles—thank you for that—focused on the mental health impacts of ICE activities in our community. The trauma is ongoing and relentless, and it is extremely damaging.

I ask that you establish a fund in the budget to assist these affected individuals, providing support for food, rental assistance, and legal aid. Partner with nonprofits to help in as many ways as possible, and include in our legislative platform support for state legislation that forbids many of the currently used illegal tactics. Other cities and counties are implementing these measures. Fullerton can demonstrate that we care for and support everyone; everyone belongs with us and to each other. We are all striving for the same things for ourselves and our families.

The trauma being inflicted is severe, and we can help alleviate some of the tragic effects through our actions. We have the power to make a difference in the kind of community we foster, and I urge you to take action tonight. Please help.

That’s my prepared statement. Now, I’d like to add some personal thoughts. Listening to everyone tonight, this whole immigrant raid situation has broken my heart more than anything else happening in our country. It pains me to see these beautiful people, speaking their lovely languages and wearing their traditional costumes, made to feel like they have to hide. This is incredibly upsetting and detracts from our entire community. Anyone who has witnessed these raids knows they are wrong—absolutely wrong and ugly. There seems to be no clear path forward; the rules are changing all the time. I know of a family affected by these circumstances.

Harry Longenbach: I have lived in Fullerton for over 25 years and have worked with people across the city on various issues facing our community. I believe that the issue we are discussing now is the greatest moral crisis our city has faced during my time here. I hope you will address it and do everything you can to confront it.

I would also like to take a moment to thank the city manager’s department and the staff who prepared the report on this issue. I believe they went above and beyond the call of duty in their work. They were tasked with looking at what a few other cities have done, and they produced a comprehensive 99-page report of resolutions and examples from various cities, including Goleta. I think they are very capable staff members who have acted with compassion. If you give them direction to work on specific solutions for us, I believe they will bring you something valuable. Thank you.

Next Speaker: I can’t really add to anything that’s already been said. The perspectives that were shared today were heartbreaking and incredible. All that I ask is please protect our community.

Jodi Aegis Vallejo: I live in Fullerton, specifically District 2, and I am a professor at USC, specializing in immigration policy and immigrant integration. I’d like to share some recent statistics released by the USC Equity Research Institute regarding Orange County. This data highlights how deeply immigrant communities are integrated into the fabric of our area, as you heard from the young people who spoke tonight. Our immigrant community in Orange County, especially in Fullerton, is essential to our social and economic structure.

In Orange County, there are over 210,000 undocumented residents, which constitutes one-fifth of all immigrants living here. As noted, a significant majority of these undocumented individuals have been here for a long time—more than a decade—raising families, paying taxes, and building homes. Their roots are our roots.

Think about how connected you might be to immigrants—whether through family, coworkers, students, members of the police force, or city management. Every one of us is touched by this issue. Currently, 216,000 people in Orange County live with undocumented family members. Among our youngest children, research indicates that 16% have at least one undocumented parent. These are our students, our coworkers, and our future leaders—people growing up in fear.

When ICE conducts raids in our neighborhoods and workplaces, it harms not just immigrants but also undermines public safety. The situation is likely to worsen. It is our responsibility at the local level to take proactive measures. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has received $170 million to become a militarized police force. Their budget surpasses that of any other country’s military, except for the United States and China, and is larger than that of any branch of the U.S. military.

So, we must ask: to what end? It is crucial for us to act local. I do not want my tax dollars funding ICE; I would prefer them to be invested in initiatives that make our city a home. Therefore, I urge you to set aside funds for a legal defense fund. We have people in this city actively supporting our community, often without public recognition. This work is happening right under our noses, and they need our support.

These stories are ongoing, and they will not stop. It is up to us to take action.

Z: I truly believe in the importance of consistency, and I want to clarify that I’m not here to ask for anything from you. Just as I wouldn’t seek your help if I were involved in a bicycle accident, I’m here to make an offer. I work as an educational psychologist and am trained as a high school counselor. If Bethany Anderson is still present, I believe she is the executive director of something important.

I would like to offer my services as a volunteer to this community, and I hope more professionals will step forward to provide support for our neighbors, friends, and loved ones. So, that’s my offer. My name is Z, and if you would like my phone number, I’m seated in the back row. I’m happy to volunteer and contribute to protecting our citizens. Thank you for your time, City Council.

Kurt Johnston: I would like to draw attention to ICE on a national level. We all know that ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but I believe it’s important to look at its impact across the country. I was watching a case on a program called Court TV about a man named Abera, who came over the border from Venezuela with three other people. Thanks to government assistance, he received a free flight to New York and a paid hotel stay. Unfortunately, he ended up killing a nursing student named Lakin.

As I explored other cases on Court TV, I discovered numerous instances where people have been killed due to immigration violations on a national scale. For me, it’s crucial to see the broader picture. I’m not entirely sure what ICE represents at the local level, but when I think about its national implications, I appreciate the acronym: National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (NICE). It signifies a commitment to keeping our country safe.

Curtis Gamble: I am an activist for homeless veterans, Cal State Fullerton students, OCTA bus drivers, seniors, and low-income communities. I want to express how challenging this situation is. I served my country as a veteran in the United States Navy and have traveled around the world twice, visiting many different countries.

While in those countries, I was always welcomed, and I made a promise to myself that if anyone ever came to America, they would be welcomed here as well. We Americans pride ourselves on our ability to travel anywhere we please, but if we don’t take care of those at home, we risk being treated the way we are treating others when we are abroad. That thought is frightening to me.

Many of us sailors formed bonds and got married during our four-year terms, which means that many people we speak about are like family to us. It pains me to see anyone treated as if they are unwelcome. This is part of the reason I served my country—to make everyone feel welcome, just as we were welcomed in other nations.

Over the past eight years, we have opened 14 to 15 emergency shelters. I believe that immigrants should be able to use these shelters as needed. After all, they are emergency shelters, and there should not be restrictions on what qualifies as an emergency.

Immigrants should have access to a CTA bus to reach one of these shelters if they feel unsafe. These shelters typically have security personnel, usually around six to eight security guards, to ensure safety, along with the support of others present.

We should utilize our resources wisely, and I recommend that we make these shelters available to anyone in need according to our municipal codes. Thank you very much.

Zoom Callers

Jose Trinidad Castaneda Casa Sanchez Mejia Nava Luhan Flores III: I will be brief and to the point. After researching possible policy opportunities to address the immigration challenges posed by ICE and the federal administration in 2023, and collaborating with the architects of these policies at the Legal Aid Defense Fund, I strongly advocated for my then-city water park to allocate a portion of its planned reserve funds to establish a new legal defense fund. Unfortunately, when I sought support from my colleagues, Council Member Conor Trout vehemently declined to back this initiative during the Biden administration, despite the favorable circumstances at that time.

Now, you have an opportunity here in Fullerton to turn this proposal into reality. It is essential to have some form of economic stabilization fund for our community because undocumented immigrants are part of our families, neighborhoods, and the larger community. They are employees, business owners, and integral to the fabric of our local economy.

Our economy is under threat, and it is being destabilized by a federal government that exhibits cruelty, particularly towards Latinos and immigrants in general. Many people in our community are affected by this, and if we do not act now, we will all face further economic destabilization.

I urge you to appropriate those planned reserve funds—which would not have been designated for other programs, projects, or departments—into a newly created legal aid defense fund. This action will distinguish you from my former colleagues in Buena Park, who failed to take action before the situation worsened. We are now in challenging times, and we must utilize reserve funds that are meant to support us during difficult periods.

This is not an exaggeration; it is a matter of literal survival for many in our community here in Fullerton. Establishing this fund is the most fiscally responsible decision we can make. Thank you.

Kayla: I admit that I haven’t read the entirety of the policy, but as someone who did review a lot of the policy for Santa Ana and looked into Costa Mesa’s as well, I am very pleased to see that Fullerton is trying to adopt similar measures. I’m particularly interested in the utility aspect—specifically, whether the city would need to cover those costs, or if they could simply forgive or suspend payments temporarily, since the city collects a lot of these bills, such as water.

I understand that city funds could definitely be used for essential needs like rent, food, especially now that some of these payments are being suspended, as well as for electricity and internet access. I just wanted to highlight that point and express my full support for the initiative being brought forward. I echo many of the comments that others have made so far regarding this issue.

Additionally, I think we should explore doing more, such as considering the creation of a Sanctuary Advisory Board where we consult with lawyers and nonprofits to discuss measures to protect our communities beyond this fund. I know that we passed a law at the state level regarding ICE agents, and I believe we can build on that.

Artificial Intelligence call was allowed to speak at City Council

The editor of the Fullerton Observer loudly objected from the audience to the AI bot being allowed to continue its rhetoric.

Mayor Fred Jung asked, “Mr. City Attorney, do we have this council any legal right to stop an AI voice? And somebody who publishes an local newspaper should realize and understand that.”

City Attorney Dick Jones responded, “As far as the speaker goes, we can’t verify whether it’s an AI voice or not. In the event the law does provide for remote speakers to come on and speak during the three minute comments.”

Council Comments

Council Member Dr. Ahmad Zahra:

I want to start by sharing something personal. I am an immigrant; I came here in my 20s, and I vividly remember the events of 9/11. For the younger generation, it may now be a historical event, but I lived through it as a young immigrant with just a green card. I remember the fear that our Muslim community experienced, but I also recall how our community came together during that difficult time—Jewish, Christian, Sikh, and others united to support one another.

Today, we are facing similar challenges and fears. I believe we should come together as a community, not judging each other’s backgrounds or status, but as neighbors and taxpayers who contribute to this country. Many of us have families that include American citizens and immigrants. I know from the community members who have spoken that everyone is affected; I am impacted, and my neighbors are impacted too. I proudly represent a district with many immigrants, and I know our mayor represents a similarly diverse community that includes first, second, and third-generation immigrants.

There are moral and practical reasons for our budget to reflect our values. When there is disruption in our community—whether from fear, economic instability, or other factors—we see it affect our businesses, our children’s education, and our local economy. We are losing out on revenue because individuals, who are also taxpayers—whether through property taxes or sales taxes—are unable to participate fully in the economy.

It is only logical that when there is a disruption in our community, we allocate funds to help those in need. From a practical standpoint, I propose that we create a resolution to reaffirm our values and establish a fund for both legal defense and humanitarian assistance, including rent support. We can model this after other cities by creating a flexible fund that collaborates with local nonprofits to assess needs and determine how much money we can allocate toward it.

Additionally, I suggest we open this fund to community donations. For instance, we could add a line on water bills that allows residents to contribute to this fund, providing an additional source of support. We could also seek partnerships with companies, corporations, and foundations that might be willing to help fund these initiatives, ensuring that the burden does not fall entirely on the city budget.

To summarize, this is not only a values statement but also a practical proposal. I would like to make a motion to move forward with the creation of this fund so that our staff can bring these items to the council for approval.

Now, regarding the legal defense fund, do you have an allocated amount in mind? I believe it is crucial for staff to have a clear figure because these expenses can add up. I suggest we start with no less than $100,000 for legal defense, and for the assistance fund, we should also allocate no less than $100,000. In total, that would be $200,000.

Lastly, I would like us to get practical legal advice. Mr. City Attorney, can a public entity establish a fund for donations? I thought we needed to maintain a separation of church and state. Please investigate if we can identify a public purpose to justify this initiative. We need to ensure that we involve the appropriate parties in this effort. We’ve successfully opened a donation fund before, such as for the murals, which received significant community support.

Mayor Pro Tem Dr. Shana Charles:

I just seconded Zahra’s motion, so you know where I stand on this issue—I believe it is something worth examining. I want to clarify that what we are doing tonight is discussing possibilities for action at the next meeting. We are not voting on this tonight, but I do hope that it will ultimately pass, given what we have heard today.

I want to emphasize something that struck me during the public comments. As someone who teaches the Constitution, I truly appreciate the importance of constitutional amendments. Specifically, the First Ten Amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, are fundamental rights that the states insisted on when this country was founded. Among these is the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits illegal search and seizure by the government. It explicitly states that no person should be subjected to such actions.

There are other parts of the Constitution where citizenship is clearly mentioned, indicating that the Founding Fathers were mindful of this matter. In fact, the presidency is the only office that explicitly requires a person to be a natural-born citizen, while Congressional members can be naturalized citizens. This inclusivity extends to other levels of government as well.

I feel fortunate to sit here between two gentlemen who are immigrants to this country. I have immense respect for anyone who has the courage to pick up and start anew in a different land. Many people immigrate out of choice, but lately, it seems that choice is increasingly becoming a privilege.

Most recent immigrants are fleeing from difficult circumstances, places that lack the protections guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Their governments often persecute individuals without any recourse.

In supporting the amicus brief for Perdomo v. ICE, we are addressing the issue of due process violations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They often act without search warrants, disregarding the rights of all individuals, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens or undocumented. There have been over 50 reported cases in Fullerton alone, and this is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

The implications extend beyond those who are undocumented. I am very concerned about the lack of legal representation, which is essential for ensuring due process. It’s heartbreaking to think of children—some as young as three years old—being forced to appear in court alone, without a lawyer or adult to advocate for them. Such circumstances are unconscionable and should never happen to any resident.

I agree with the Founding Fathers: no person should be denied these protections. Everyone deserves due process, and providing legal assistance is a crucial part of that. I believe that the City of Fullerton can take action in this regard, and I hope our staff can devise a way to create a $100,000 legal defense fund.

Additionally, we need a basic needs fund, and I’ve heard from many community members who want to donate but don’t know how to contribute. This could serve as a fantastic opportunity for community collaboration. The newly established Fullerton Community Foundation aims to do good work and could be a great avenue for this support. I hope we can all come together to agree on these proposals.

Council Member Jamie Valencia:

“We are voting on the motion proposed by Council Member Zahra, which is not one of the current options.” She has asked the City Clerk to review the motion again.

City Clerk Lucinda Williams:

The motion is to return at the next meeting with a resolution outlining values for consideration. It also includes the establishment of two funds: one for legal assistance and another for basic needs, with each fund set at a minimum of $100,000. Additionally, the motion includes the acceptance of donations.

Valencia:

Is there a way to amend this? I would like to work with all the nonprofits in our community, as that was one of the options presented by staff.

Council Members Charles and Zahra:

They affirmed that work with all the nonprofits was part of the original motion.

Mayor Fred Jung:

Throughout my life, I’ve often been reminded that I am an immigrant, with people telling me even now to “go home.” I understand when desperate communities cry out for help—this is why the Council has decided to defend them from a legal standpoint. However, we are facing a $10 million paper deficit, which is not a practical reality. That is simply the truth. There’s nothing practical about it. I’ve spoken with many of you in private about this matter, and I understand your concerns. I hope you can understand mine as well.

Voting Results:

Council Member Dunlap: No

Council Member Valencia: Yes

Council Member Zahra: Aye

Mayor Pro Tem Charles: Aye

Mayor Jung: No

Abrego’s deportation dispute and Africa’s role

Abrego’s case became symbolic of the complexities surrounding Washington’s “third-country” deportation strategy, which seeks to resettle deported migrants in nations with no direct connection to their origin or criminal history.

Axios

The policy, critics argue, exposes deportees to human rights risks and undermines international asylum norms.

Liberia, in a statement through its Ministry of Information, said its decision to receive Abrego was made “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis” following a formal U.S. request as per Reuters.

ADVERTISEMENT

The government added that it would ensure the migrant is not transferred “to any country where he may face substantial risk of persecution, torture or other serious harm.”

Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily halted the deportation, pending a ruling on Abrego’s legal challenge for release from immigration detention. It remains unclear whether the new agreement will alter the court’s position.

Trump’s third-country deportation drive

The Trump administration has increasingly relied on bilateral arrangements with African and Central American nations to offload deportees when their home countries refuse reentry. However, several African governments including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Libya have previously resisted or outright rejected third-country deportation proposals, citing sovereignty concerns, security risks, and public opposition.

Analysts say the Liberia deal may signal Washington’s determination to continue pursuing its global deportation network, even amid diplomatic resistance.

“It reflects how far the U.S. is willing to go to sustain its hardline immigration agenda,” said a Washington-based policy expert familiar with African-U.S. migration issues.

But experts who spoke to the Guardian warn that he is doing so in a way that is almost certainly illegal and, if left unchecked, bodes ill for Congress’s constitutional authority to control government spending. Some fear it could set the stage for the president to unilaterally fund other contentious decisions in the future, such as the deployment of the military on US soil.

“I’m with the people who believe that there’s really no good legal justification for moving the money around in this way,” said Phil Wallach, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the separation of powers in the US government.

“There’s no congressional authorization for troop payment for this new fiscal year. So it’s going pretty far out on a legal limb, and just sort of daring anybody to do anything about it. Because, of course, substantially, nobody thinks it’s very bad to pay the troops.”

The federal government shut down at the start of October after Democrats and Republicans in Congress failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September. About 700,000 federal workers have been furloughed, while hundreds of thousands of others continue to report to work, but are not getting paychecks.

Troops were paid during previous government shutdowns because Congress had either approved defense department spending, or passed bills specifically to guarantee their salaries, said Bobby Kogan, a former White House office of management and budget official who is now with the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank.

Congress took neither of those actions this time, though lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to get legislation addressing federal workers’ pay through Congress, as recently as this week.

Last week, Trump acted unilaterally, repurposing a reported $8bn in defense department funds meant for research and development to pay the military in the middle of October. Kogan called the decision “super duper duper illegal” under federal law.

“If you try to spend money you have on the wrong purpose, you’re in trouble. And if you try to spend money into a purpose that you don’t have money for that purpose, then you’re in trouble as well,” he said.

On Thursday, Trump said an unnamed “friend” had contributed $130m to pay service members during the shutdown, later revealed by the New York Times to be reclusive billionaire and Trump supporter Timothy Mellon. Sean Parnell, the chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed acceptance of the funds “under its general gift acceptance authority. The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits.”

Christopher Mirasola, a law professor at the University of Houston, said that the civil servants who carried out Trump’s order to repurpose funds could theoretically be prosecuted for violating a law called the Antideficiency Act. But such prosecutions have never happened in the past, and he said in an interview he finds it difficult to believe Trump’s justice department, or even another president, would carry them out.

“I’m just not sure if a future administration would have the appetite to bring career government officials who at that point would have suffered years of abuse at the hands of the administration for complying with something even if they knew that it was illegal,” Mirasola said.

Trump foes who tried to sue over it – think Democratic lawmakers or civil society groups – may have trouble proving that they were harmed by paying the troops, a necessary component for bringing a case, Kogan said.

“You’re in tough places here to find standing under this supreme court, at least under the Trump administration,” he said.

The experts viewed Trump’s move to pay troops as his latest attempt to shift the power of the purse away from Congress and into the executive branch, but differed over how significant it was in the long term. Since taking office, he has used a variety of methods to halt government spending on areas his administration opposes, including a controversial pocket rescission of foreign aid funds.

“I think the crisis will start to feel more acute if we start seeing the president moving money around to do things that are very politically controversial,” said Wallach, noting that paying US armed forces is “something that basically everybody agrees on”.

The ball is now in the Republican-controlled Congress’s court to make clear that it is they who make the decisions about spending, Wallach said.

“I certainly don’t think among GOP appropriators, they’re like wanting to see the White House just take things over. I’m really quite certain that they’re distressed by this dynamic and want to get away from it as fast as they can,” he said.

Kogan warned that Trump was launching an offensive against Congress’s appropriations process, by which lawmakers, usually working in a bipartisan fashion, outline how much the government will spend, and on what.

“If the president can just completely ignore anything and everything, can spend money into existence, he can drain accounts and use them on whatever he wants, right?” Kogan said. “Like, what are we even doing there? That makes you an appropriations king.”

Such decisions may paradoxically make finding an agreement to reopen the government harder, by sapping the trust in Congress that any legislative deal Democrats sign on to will be honored by Trump.

“The whole point of the budget deal is to figure out how you’re going to allocate your limited resources. We are going to figure out what we want to prioritize in the government, and if the president has complete and unilateral authority to ignore every part of that deal, how can you ever do appropriations? How can you ever make a funding deal?” Kogan.

Mirasola connected the pay decision to Trump’s deployment of national guard troops into cities across the country, including Washington DC, Chicago and Portland. He views many of the federal laws that govern how the military may be used on US soil as outdated, and the main obstacle Trump faces is his ability to get Congress to pay for the soldiers.

“If my theory that appropriations are the most important limit on these domestic military deployments, if that’s true, then moves like this to edge Congress out of the appropriations process [are] really a strike at one of the most significant amendments on the president’s authority to use the military in the United States,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c884ab773bdc8f41040f7ff0a604bf2d6e95f4f3/250_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82cd07b6fd2514c641d7b3a9e8dddbf8",N,,2025-10-26 10:57:29.617247

Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.
We are absolutely unified on that.” The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia.
Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.
The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown.
“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.","Twenty-two days into the government shutdown, California Rep. Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.

Normally, one of his staff members would have led the tour. But the Capitol is closed to all tours during the shutdown, unless the elected member is present. So the schoolchildren from Lyman Gilmore Middle School ended up with Kiley, a Republican from Rocklin, as their personal tour guide.

“I would have visited with these kids anyway,” Kiley said in his office after the event. “But I actually got to go on the whole tour of the Capitol with them as well.”

Kiley’s impromptu tour is an example of how members of California’s congressional delegation are improvising their routines as the shutdown drags on and most of Washington remains at a standstill.

Some are in Washington in case negotiations resume, others are back at home in their districts meeting with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay, giving interviews or visiting community health centers that rely on tax credits central to the budget negotiations. One member attended the groundbreaking of a flood control project in their district. Others are traveling back and forth.

“I’ve had to fly back to Washington for caucus meetings, while the opposition, the Republicans, don’t even convene and meet,” Rep. Maxine Waters, a longtime Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview. “We will meet anytime, anyplace, anywhere, with [House Speaker Mike] Johnson, with the president, with the Senate, to do everything that we can to open up the government. We are absolutely unified on that.”

The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia. Food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could soon be delayed. And millions of Californians could see their healthcare premiums rise sharply if Affordable Care Act subsidies are allowed to expire.

For the California delegation, the fallout at home has become impossible to ignore. Yet the shutdown is in its fourth week with no end in sight.

In the House, Johnson has refused to call members back into session and prevented them from doing legislative work. Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.

“I have certainly emphasized the point that the House needs to be in session, and that canceling a month’s worth of session is not a good thing for the House or the country,” Kiley said, noting that he had privately met with Johnson.

Kiley, who represented parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe, is facing political uncertainty as California voters weigh whether to approve Proposition 50 on Nov. 4. The measure would redraw the state’s congressional districts to better favor Democrats, leaving Kiley at risk, even though the Republican says he believes he could still win if his right-leaning district is redrawn.

The Senate has been more active, holding a series of votes on the floor and congressional hearings with Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The chamber, however, has been unable to reach a deal to reopen the government. On Thursday, the 23rd day of the shutdown, the Senate failed to advance competing measures that would have paid federal employees who have been working without compensation.

The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats backed a bill that would have paid all federal workers and barred the Trump administration from laying off any more federal employees.

“California has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, and no federal worker or service member should miss their paychecks because Donald Trump and Republicans refused to come to the table to protect Americans’ health care,” Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.

Working conditions get harder

The strain on federal employees — including those who work for California’s 54 delegation members — are starting to become more apparent.

Dozens of them have been working full time without pay. Their jobs include answering phone calls and requests from constituents, setting the schedules for elected officials, writing policy memos and handling messaging for their offices.

At the end of October, House staffers — who are paid on a monthly basis — are expected to miss their first paycheck.

Some have been quietly told to consider borrowing money from the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, which is offering a “government shutdown relief loan program” that includes a no-interest loan of up to $5,000 to be repaid in full after 90 days.

The mundane has also been disrupted. Some of the cafeterias and coffee carts that are usually open to staffers are closed. The lines to enter office buildings are long because fewer entrances are open.

The hallways leading to the offices of California’s elected officials are quiet, except for the faint sound of occasional elevator dings. Many of their doors are adorned with signs that show who they blame for the government shutdown.

“Trump and Republicans shut down the government,” reads a sign posted on the door that leads into Rep. Norma Torres’ (D-Pomona) office. “Our office is OPEN — WORKING for the American people.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, posted a similar sign outside his office.

Rep. Vince Fong, a Republican who represents the Central Valley, has been traveling between Washington and his district. Two weeks into the shutdown, he met with veterans from the Central Valley Honor Flight and Kern County Honor Flight to make sure that their planned tour of the Capitol was not disrupted by the shutdown. Like Kiley’s tour with the schoolchildren, an elected member needed to be present for the tour to go on.

“His presence ensured the tour could continue as planned,” Fong’s office said.

During the tour, veterans were able to see Johnson as well, his office said.

Shutdown highlights deep divisions

California’s congressional delegation mirrors the broader stalemate in Washington, where entrenched positions have kept both parties at a negotiation impasse.

Democrats are steadfast in their position that they will not agree to a deal unless Republicans extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits expiring at the end of the year, while Republicans are accusing Democrats of failing to reopen the government for political gain.

Kiley is one of the few Republicans who has called on Johnson to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare. Kiley said he thinks there is a “a lot of room to negotiate” because there is concern on both sides of the aisle if the tax credits expire.

“If people see a massive increase in their premiums ... that’s not a good thing,” he said. “Especially in California, where the cost of living is already so high, and you’re suddenly having to pay a lot more for healthcare.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press event Wednesday with five other California Democrats talked about the need to fight for the healthcare credits.

Garcia, of Long Beach, said he recently visited a healthcare center in San Bernardino County that serves seniors with disabilities. He said the cuts would be “devastating” and would prompt the center to close.

“That’s why we are doing everything in our power to negotiate a deal that reopens the federal government and saves healthcare,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, many Democrats are digging their heels on the issue.

At an Oct. 3 event outside of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, for instance, Rep. Laura Friedman held a news conference with nurses and hospital staff and said she would not vote for a bill to reopen the government unless there is a deal on healthcare.

Last week, the Glendale Democrat said her position hasn’t changed.

“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/908468d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5703x2994+0+404/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F83%2F494200f74ea08a318ce235971ba3%2F1526823-na-congressman-kiley-6951.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:32.914472

Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.
Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.
Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina.
Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers.","When President Trump announced a $20 billion bailout for Argentina this month, Larry Ory, 86, a farmer in Earlham, Iowa, could hardly believe it, especially after boatloads of Argentine soybeans began shipping to China, a once-critical customer for Mr. Ory's family.

For Iowans, losing China’s soybean market in the president’s trade war was only one of many economic shocks that have hit the state since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. The cost of tractors and fertilizers have shot up with his tariffs. Labor has grown scarcer in agribusinesses. Major manufacturers have laid off workers. Even the ubiquitous wind turbines that provide income for some Iowa farmers are in the president’s sights.

“Right now, we’re fighting different economic wars all at once,” said Summer Ory, 37, the wife of Mr. Ory’s grandson, Dan. The couple works in the family’s farm business. “You can sustain it one at a time, but right now it’s death by a thousand paper cuts.”

Since siding with Barack Obama twice, Iowa has become a stronghold for Mr. Trump. Yet perhaps no state has struggled more with his economic policies. During the first quarter of 2025, Iowa’s gross domestic product dropped by 6.1 percent, more than any other state aside from neighboring Nebraska.

Manufacturing, which drives 17 percent of Iowa’s economic output, has been hit with higher production costs in part because of steep tariffs on inputs like aluminum and steel. Meatpacking plants, which help make Iowa the nation’s leading pork producer, rely heavily on foreign-born workers, hundreds of thousands of whom saw their legal status stripped away by the president. Mr. Trump’s war on renewable energy also threatens the wind industry that produces more than half of Iowa’s electricity.

Some of the state’s troubles, like bad weather, high interest rates, an aging and shrinking rural population, and global commodity prices, are beyond the president’s control. But new economic policies have magnified the state’s woes, according to economists, agricultural groups and some business leaders.

“This is as challenging as I’ve seen it,” Kirk Leeds, the chief executive of the Iowa Soybean Association, said. “We’ve got uncertainties beyond compare.”

Next year’s midterm elections could indicate how Iowans feel about those policies. At least two competitive House districts will be up for a vote. The state will also choose a replacement for its retiring governor, Kim Reynolds, and a retiring senator, Joni Ernst. All those posts are held by Republicans.

“People are hurting everywhere in Iowa, and they’re looking for something different,” said Josh Turek, a Democratic state house member running for Ms. Ernst’s seat.

Mr. Trump has argued the tariffs will help protect American jobs and rectify trade imbalances, while enforcing immigration laws will free up work for citizens.

“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, adding that the president was “capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.”

And many Iowans remain loyal. Doug Keller, 63, who farms about 15 miles southwest of Waterloo, said he was hopeful the president will reach a new trade deal with China that will benefit farmers in the long run. Matt Wyatt, 51, who also voted for Mr. Trump, agreed.

“Money is tighter than it should be,” said Mr. Wyatt, who works with Mr. Keller to grow corn and soybeans on close to 1,500 acres of land. “But we try to stay optimistic around here.”

For now, times are tough. Iowa is the country’s second-largest producer of both corn and soybeans. America exports as much as half its soybeans, and the vast majority of that had gone to China — $12.6 billion worth last year.

But this year, China stopped purchasing soybeans from the United States to retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. American producers have spent decades working with people in China on how to use soy in animal feed, part of an effort to build up that growing market. Mr. Leeds said he has traveled to the country 25 times and used dollars paid by Iowa farmers to foster strong bonds with Chinese importers.

“I’m not exactly sure how we repair some of these relationships,” Mr. Leeds said.

The president’s bailout of his ally, President Javier Milei of Argentina, has rankled many Iowans, since China moved immediately after it was announced to lock up Argentine soybean exports to fill the gap from Beijing’s boycott of American soy.

“Who are you subsidizing, our competitors or us?” Larry Ory asked.

Iowa’s large beef industry then recoiled after Mr. Trump suggested he would try to lower the cost of beef by importing more from Argentina. Bryan Whaley, the chief executive of the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association, said Mr. Trump’s comments roiled cattle markets, and a volatile market “provides less of an opportunity for our producers — cattlemen and women here in Iowa — to make decisions that are going to help keep them profitable and viable.”

The president said he will take some money raised by his tariffs and “give it to farmers” as a bailout, but that is not necessarily welcome news.

“We would much rather farm with no federal assistance whatsoever,” Mr. Wyatt said. “We want to be able to sell our products for a good value, and normally we can.”

John Gilbert, a farmer in Iowa Falls, said he expected the government payments to favor larger agribusinesses and to drive more consolidation in an industry that has been dominated by big corporations.

“The payments are skewed to the bigger guys,” said Mr. Gilbert, a Democrat whose family has about 800 acres of land for grains and livestock.

As he deals with those higher prices, Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer in rural Polk County, said he will continue to use his more than 25-year-old, worn combine. A machine with greater power and a more sophisticated GPS system would cost upward of $100,000 used and more than $250,000 new, he said.

Mr. Lehman wondered whether his 26-year-old son could realistically earn a living working full time on the family farm.

“Our farms, and lots of farms, are having to assess if there’s real opportunity for years down the road,” said Mr. Lehman, who serves as president of the Iowa Farmers Union.

The economic pain has spread beyond agriculture to truckers who transport seeds and grains, agronomists who help farmers innovate, and the Main Street restaurants where farmers eat and drink.

“Everywhere you turn, people are asking, ‘How are you going to make it?’” Ms. Ory said.

Dan Ory, 37, her husband, called it “just the perfect storm.”

John Deere, a leading manufacturing employer that makes agricultural equipment, has laid off hundreds of workers from its Iowa factories this year as sales decline and tariffs on steel and aluminum cost the company more than $300 million.

Employment in Iowa’s food manufacturing is down too. Peter Orazem, an economics professor at Iowa State University, linked that to layoffs of migrant workers. JBS Foods, a Brazilian meatpacker, laid off approximately 200 workers from Haiti, Cuba, El Salvador and Honduras at a plant in Ottumwa in June, said Paulina Ocegueda, vice president for the local chapter of LULAC, a Hispanic civil rights organization.

“It’s not costless to replace that number of workers,” Dr. Orazem said. He added that it was “difficult to find domestic workers who take these jobs.”

In Waterloo, some Haitian workers lost jobs at a Tyson pork processing plant, said Yves Fleurima, a community outreach coordinator for World Grace Project, which helps refugees and other new migrants in Waterloo find employment. Workers had received letters from the Department of Homeland Security telling them their legal immigration status would be terminated and they should leave the country, he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said humanitarian parole programs “undercut American workers” and allowed “poorly vetted” people into the country.

JBS employs more than 5,000 people at four production facilities in Iowa, according to Nikki Richardson, a spokeswoman for the company. Two more plants are under construction and expected to create close to 1,000 additional jobs in Iowa, she added.

“We are focused on hiring team members who are legally authorized to work in the United States and will continue to follow the guidance provided to us by the U.S. government,” she said in an email.

Tyson did not respond to requests for comment.

Iowa’s renewable energy sector is also facing uncertainty, driven by what appears to be the president’s personal animus toward wind power. The Trump administration and Congress have cut funding for major renewable projects, phased out renewable energy tax credits and issued new rules to make it harder for some projects to qualify for those credits.

The impacts might be modest in Iowa, according to Steve Guyer, a senior lawyer at Iowa Environmental Council, because the state has already heavily invested in wind energy. Still, he said the new rules must be navigated, while tariffs raise the cost of new turbines.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/25/arts/nat-iowa-stilo-cine-still/nat-iowa-stilo-cine-still-facebookJumbo.png,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:36.631730

“Upon entering U.S. custody, they (Ushakov and Skitsan) were separated without explanation,” said América Diversa.
“We firmly assert that such legislation flagrantly violates fundamental human rights standards and principles.
International human rights standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, emphasize that everyone has the right to self-determination, privacy and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
Denying trans and gender diverse individuals access to trans-specific healthcare and legal gender recognition blatantly disregards the international human rights framework,” ILGA-Europe wrote.","A gay married couple from Russia who has asked for asylum in the U.S. has been in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody for nearly a year.

América Diversa, a group that advocates on behalf of LGBTQ immigrants, told the Washington Blade that Andrei Ushakov and Aleksandr Skitsan fled Russia on March 14, 2024, “after the government began labelling LGBTQIA+ organizations as ‘extremist.’” Skitsan “faced direct threats at his workplace, forcing them to flee for their safety.”

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report specifically notes a Russian authorities “used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.” The 2023 report also cites reports that “state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya” and “government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists.”

Advocacy groups in August sharply criticized the State Department after it “erased” LGBTQ and intersex people from its 2024 human rights report. Immigration Equality and other organizations say this omission could jeopardize the cases of LGBTQ who are seeking asylum in the U.S.

Couple separated, not receiving proper medical care in ICE custody

América Diversa says Ushakov and Skitsan arrived in Mexico on March 15, 2024.

The men used the CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) One app the Biden-Harris administration created that allowed them and other asylum seekers to schedule an appointment at a port of entry. Their appointment was on Nov. 27, 2024, and America Diversa said they asked for asylum on that day once they entered the U.S.

The Trump-Vance administration discontinued the CBP One app on Jan. 20, the day it took office.

“Upon entering U.S. custody, they (Ushakov and Skitsan) were separated without explanation,” said América Diversa.

Ushakov and Skitsan were initially detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, Calif., which is in the state’s Imperial Valley.

“Andrei was placed in an overcrowded unit with more than 60 detainees, where poor sanitation, excessive air conditioning, and the lack of adequate medical care have put his health at risk,” said América Diversa.

The group says the couple are now at the San Luis Regional Detention Center in San Luis, Ariz.

“They are now being denied all communication with each other, despite being legally married and sharing the same asylum case,” said América Diversa.

The group notes Ushakov has a “chronic medical condition that requires continuous medication and quarterly monitoring.”

“Despite repeated requests, he faces long delays in treatment and limited access to medical services,” said América Diversa.

América Diversa also noted Skitsan suffers from a “chronic ear infection, which causes ringing and temporary hearing loss, as well as untreated stomach issues.” América Diversa said Skitsan had been scheduled to see a doctor in December, but his “recent transfer to Arizona has jeopardized that case.”

“Their transfer to the San Luis Regional Detention Center has further worsened their situation,” said América Diversa. “At this new facility, they have been prohibited from communicating with each other, an act that violates not only basic humanitarian principles but also their rights as a legally married couple under both U.S. and international law.”

América Diversa Managing Director Yonatan Matheus on Oct. 22 told the Blade he had just spoken with Ushakov.

“He couldn’t talk with his husband, he was only able to talk with me for less than five minutes,” said Matheus. “The calls are recorded and monitored. He is very afraid to speak.”

The couple’s case are among those that have garnered attention since the Trump-Vance administration took office.

The White House earlier this year “forcibly disappeared” Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist who asked for asylum in the U.S., to El Salvador. He returned to his homeland in July after he spent more than 100 days in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum-security prison known by the Spanish acronym CECOT.

ICE agents in August arrested Alice Correia Barbosa, a transgender Brazilian woman, while she was driving her car in Silver Spring, Md. A senior Department of Homeland Security official who misgendered Correia told the Blade that she “overstayed his visa by almost six years” and DHS plans to deport her.

Brazil has the highest number of reported murders of trans people in the world.

ICE did not respond to the Blade’s request for comment about Ushakov and Skitsan’s case.

On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin took his oath of office becoming the second ever longest serving leader of the modern Russian state since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, who held power from 1922 until his death in 1953.

Putin’s tenure in office has been marked by his acquisition of concentrated political power in part due to his eradication and imprisonment or the deaths of his political opponents, such as his rumored unproven involvement in the assassination of fierce Putin critic Boris Nemtsov on Feb. 27, 2015, just steps away from the gate to the Kremlin, and more recently in the prosecution and imprisonment of another high profile Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, who died on Feb. 16 at a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle.

Putin ordered military operations in August 2008, which led to the Russo-Georgian War and diplomatic relations were broken. To this day, the two countries have maintained no formal diplomatic relations. Then in February and March 2014, Russian troops at his direction invaded the Crimean Peninsula, part of Ukraine, and annexed it. The resulting hostilities also spread to the far-eastern Ukrainian oblasts, [provinces] which culminated with Russia invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since the end of World War II in 1945.

As the war drags on Putin’s threats of military escalation against NATO countries and use of battlefield nuclear weapons has created a tense relationship with a majority of the European Union as well as with the United States. Russia has been heavily sanctioned by the West and is turning to other totalitarian regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.

In his inaugural speech Putin made oblique reference to his oft stated desire to recreate a hybrid of the former Soviet Union:

“In these solemn and crucial moments of assuming the office of the president, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the citizens of Russia across all regions of our country, as well as those living in the historical territories of Russia who have won their right to stand united with our Motherland.”

The Russian president then thanked the forces fighting in the invasion of Ukraine saying:

“I humbly honor our heroes, the participants in the special military operation, and all those who are fighting for our Fatherland. I would like to thank you again for the trust you have placed in me and for your unwavering support. These words are directed to every citizen of Russia.”

On the domestic front Putin has stifled media outlets with draconian laws passed designed to keep the Russian population largely ignorant of the cost both human lives and governmental spending as the warfare in Ukraine drags on and losses to the Russian military continue.

The Associated Press reported neither the U.S., U.K. nor German ambassadors attended. The U.S. Embassy said Amb. Lynne Tracy was out of the country on “prescheduled, personal travel.”

A handful of EU envoys attended even though top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he told them “the right thing to do is not to attend this inauguration,” because Putin is the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.

In his speech Putin issued a veiled threat to critics of his regime that dissention would not be tolerated:

“We can see that the atmosphere in society has changed, and how much we now value reliability, responsibility, sincerity, integrity, generosity, and courage. I will do everything in my power to ensure that those who have displayed these admirable human and professional traits, and who have proved their loyalty to the fatherland through their deeds, achieve leading positions in state governance, the economy and all other spheres.

We must ensure reliable continuity in the development of our country for decades to come and bring up new generations who will strengthen Russia’s might and develop our state based on interethnic accord, the preservation of the traditions of all ethnic groups living in Russia, a civilizational nation united by the Russian language and our multi-ethnic culture.”

The Russian president has also targeted the country’s LGBTQ community with passage of multiple laws that forbid public mention or acknowledgment of queer Russians. In his speech he emphasized his commitment to maintaining “family values.”

“Our top priority is the preservation of the people. I am confident that the support of centuries-old family values and traditions will continue to unite public and religious associations, political parties, and all levels of government.

Our decisions regarding the development of the country and its regions must be effective and fair and must promote the prosperity of Russian families and improve their quality of life,” he said.

The Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank in D.C., noted recently:

“Escalating state discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community in Russia is directly informed by the Putin regime’s struggle to maintain legitimacy and public support, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on. Russian federal elections are scheduled for 2024, and officials are reportedly planning to project record levels of public support for Putin.”

The war in Ukraine and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community are both popular policies among the socially conservative interest groups that make up Putin’s strongest base of support, and Russian policymakers draw clear connections between the Kremlin’s narrative that Russia is fighting Western ideology by proxy in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s attack on the LGBTQ+ experience in Russia.

Putin’s inaugural speech today signaled his future intentions on conducting the war in Ukraine and his ongoing persecution of LGBTQ+ Russians.”

Legislation that will effectively ban the existence of transgender Russians was signed on Monday as expected by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The new law, which takes effective immediately, was passed earlier this month by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, and then last week by the Federal Council, which is its upper body.

The law now bans Russians from changing their gender on official government identity documents including internal and external passports, driver’s licenses and birth certificates, although gender marker changes had been legal since 1997.

Medical healthcare providers are now banned from “performing medical interventions designed to change the sex of a person,” including surgery and prescribing hormone therapy.

The law, which human rights organizations have labeled draconian and barbaric, also bans individuals who have undergone gender reassignment from adopting children and annuls marriages in which one of the partners is trans.

LGBTQ activists have warned that the law will lead to a further increase in already high rates of suicide and suicide attempts among trans Russians. Worse, say sympathetic physicians and trans rights advocates, it will foment an underground market for surgeries and medications, which are dangerous as unproven drugs or outright fake drugs may cause irreparable harm.

LGBTQ activists also said that this law will lead to an increase in attempted suicides among trans youth unable to access medical care.

“The way how these people see their future is collapsing,” Yan Dvorkin, the head of Center-T, a group that helps trans and nonbinary people in Russia, said in an interview with The Moscow Times earlier this month.

During debate over the law, Deputy Duma Speaker Pytor Tolstoy, a co-sponsor of the legislation, pointed out that banning the “practice of transgenderism” was in the interest of national security.

The diagnosis of “transsexualism,” he added, refers to gender identity disorders and is the basis for recognizing a citizen as unfit for military service. In addition, “we must not forget that by changing the sex of one of the partners, a homosexual couple gets the right to adopt a child. Unfortunately, there are already such cases in Russia,” he said.

LGBTQ and human rights organization ILGA-Europe issued a statement condemning the actions of the Duma and offered support and solidarity with the Russian trans and queer communities.

“We firmly assert that such legislation flagrantly violates fundamental human rights standards and principles.

ILGA-Europe firmly believe in the inherent dignity and equal rights of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. International human rights standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, emphasize that everyone has the right to self-determination, privacy and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Denying trans and gender diverse individuals access to trans-specific healthcare and legal gender recognition blatantly disregards the international human rights framework,” ILGA-Europe wrote.

A young woman who only identified herself to Russian freelance journalist Sergei Dimitrov by the name Elena, told him in an interview in St. Petersburg earlier this month:

“There is no safety anymore, soon they will openly hunt us like swine, we no right to exist they say,” she said.

Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.

A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.

Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”

The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:57:03.039460

""Secretary Rollins' claim that the Trump Administration is unable to deliver November SNAP benefits during a shutdown is unequivocally false,"" Parrott said.
They further highlighted that ""the Trump administration has spent the entire year endangering the food security of millions of Americans.
""In order to make the deadline, the Trump administration would have needed to start preparing for partial payments weeks ago, which it has not done.""
After also obtaining the memo, CNN asked Trump if he would direct the USDA to fund SNAP next month.","Elected Democrats and other critics on Saturday continued to call out the Trump administration for refusing to use contingency funding to pay for food stamps during the US government shutdown, imperiling hunger relief for about 42 million low-income people.

In November, Americans who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits won't get their food aid if Congress doesn't reach an agreement to fund the government, which shut down at the beginning of the month due to a battle over healthcare.

""Congress established an emergency fund to ensure that millions of Americans on SNAP continue to receive nutrition assistance when funding expires in November,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, said on social media Saturday.

Sanders—the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions—then appealed directly to Republican President Donald Trump: ""Don't let kids go hungry. Use these emergency funds to feed low-income families.""

Throughout the week, left-leaning groups, congressional Democrats, and Democratic governors of states including Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, have called for using the contingency fund.

Sharon Parrott, a former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official who is now president of the think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, took aim at US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in a Wednesday statement.

""Secretary Rollins' claim that the Trump Administration is unable to deliver November SNAP benefits during a shutdown is unequivocally false,"" Parrott said. ""In fact, the administration is legally required to use contingency reserves—billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown—to fund November benefits for the 1 in 8 Americans who need SNAP to afford their grocery bill.""

""Speaking as a former OMB official, I know from experience that the federal government has the authority and the tools it needs during a shutdown to get these SNAP funds to families,"" she continued. ""It would be unconscionable for the administration to go out of its way to threaten millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, parents, and workers with hunger, rather than taking all legal steps available to provide food assistance to people who need it.""

That same day, a trio of experts at the Center for American Progress also argued that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) ""is legally obligated to use"" the contingency resources. They further highlighted that ""the Trump administration has spent the entire year endangering the food security of millions of Americans. From terminating funding used to purchase food for schools and food banks to passing the largest cuts in SNAP history, the administration has made it clear that its goal is to take food away from hungry families—and that sentiment is extending to the USDA's approach to the shutdown.""

US House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Subcommittee on Nutrition and Foreign Agriculture Ranking Member Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), along with nearly every other Democrat in the chamber, sent a letter to Rollins on Friday. They wrote:

USDA's shutdown plan acknowledges that ""congressional intent is evident that SNAP's operations should continue since the program has been provided with multiyear contingency funds."" USDA still has significant funding available in SNAP's contingency reserve—which Congress provides precisely for this reason—that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits.

We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance. Additionally, while the contingency reserve will not cover November benefits in full, we urge USDA to use its statutory transfer authority or an other legal authority at its disposal to supplement these dollars and fully fund November benefits.

As Politico reported Friday, ""The contingency fund for SNAP currently holds roughly $5 billion, which would not cover the full $9 billion the administration would need to fund November benefits.""

""Even if the administration did partially tap those funds, it would take weeks to dole out the money on a pro rata basis—meaning most low-income Americans would miss their November food benefits anyway,"" the outlet explained. ""In order to make the deadline, the Trump administration would have needed to start preparing for partial payments weeks ago, which it has not done.""

Politico and other outlets obtained a brief memo from the USDA blaming Democrats for the disruption and claiming that ""contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.""

""SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits,"" the memo states. ""The contingency fund is not available to support [fiscal year] 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.""

""Instead, the contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,"" it continues. ""For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida.""

The memo adds that ""this administration will not allow Democrats to jeopardize funding for school meals and infant formula in order to prolong their shutdown.""

After also obtaining the memo, CNN asked Trump if he would direct the USDA to fund SNAP next month. The president—who left for Asia later Friday—claimed, ""Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep,"" without offering any details.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61922734&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C504%2C0%2C504,N,,2025-10-26 10:57:40.555440

Since regaining the presidency, he has pursued policies that seek to reverse the country's racial diversification and make it -- and its government -- whiter again, as it was before millions of immigrants entered from South and Central America, Africa and Asia.

In 1947, when Trump was born, the United States was over 89 percent white; today, that percentage is just over 60 percent. Back then, most entering immigrants came from Europe; now, fewer than 20 percent do.

In 2024, Trump's support from white voters -- 57 percent, according to exit polls -- was about the same as backed GOP candidates in the previous six elections. But in office, he has reversed both policies and appointments to favor whites over people of color.

His Justice Department revoked long-standing legal interventions favoring Black plaintiffs in civil rights cases, and his administration has accelerated deportation of illegal immigrants -- and some legal ones -- who are mostly people of color.

Meanwhile, Trump has removed several prominent Black officials named by his own and prior administrations, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and replaced almost all of them with white appointees.

In addition, The New York Times said he is considering a major change in immigration policy that would favor white immigrants from Europe and South Africa.

Last week, the Justice Department joined critics of a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in urging the Supreme Court to reverse its long-standing policy requiring consideration of race in congressional redistricting. The court's conservative majority seemed amenable to the change, which would almost certainly reduce the number of Black representatives in Congress.

Earlier, the department announced it had changed the focus of its civil rights division, dropping challenges to several state actions the Biden administration contended were discriminatory against Blacks and other minorities, dismissing lawsuits challenging the right of states to purge voters right before an election, and challenging the race-based creation of several Texas congressional districts it previously approved.

Voting rights division attorneys were directed to dismiss all active voting discrimination challenges, and a new mission statement stressed the goal of fighting voter fraud, though proven cases have been rare.

Trump, himself, gave an unusually candid exposition of his views on the country's racial makeup during his first term, when he criticized the influx of immigrants from predominantly Black and brown countries and called for more from mostly white European nations.

At a January 2018 meeting to consider a possible compromise on immigration issues, news organizations reported that Trump complained about ""having all these people from s---hole countries come here,"" citing Haiti, El Salvador and Africa as examples. ""We should have more people from Norway,"" he said. Norway is over 90 percent white.

And during his successful 2024 campaign, The New York Times reported similar comments to a group of millionaire donors. ""Why can't we allow people to come in from nice countries,"" he reportedly asked, adding, ""I'm trying to be nice. Nice countries, you know like Denmark, Switzerland? Do we have any people coming in from Denmark? How about Switzerland? How about Norway?"" All are over 90 percent white.

Now, he is preparing to change that.

Soon after taking office, his administration barred most new asylum applicants from Africa and Central America, but Trump started a program granting entry to white South Africans on grounds they were subject to discrimination from the land reform policies of the country's Black majority government.

More recently, The Times reported the administration is considering slashing the asylum program designed to protect refugees from violence and discrimination and instead favoring admission of white South Africans and Europeans who shared its views on immigration.

Trump has also shown his racial priorities in his appointments -- and in those he has fired. After all, the president gained a lot of his initial following by firing people on a weekly television show.

In his first 200 days, the nonpartisan Brookings Institution said 91 percent of his appointees were white and 88 percent male. The only recent administration with similar statistics was Trump's first administration, where his appointments during a similar period were 90 percent white.

By contrast, former President Joe Biden's appointments during his first 200 days were only 53 percent white and 38 percent male.

Trump's only black Cabinet member is Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development.

Soon after taking office, he fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the second Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the first woman to serve as Chief of Naval Operations and commandant of the Coast Guard. All of the Joint Chiefs are now white men.

Several other prominent Black officers have also left, most recently Gen. Alvin Holsey, commander of the Southern Command.

Trump also fired several top Black civilian officials, including Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress; Gwynne A. Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board; Robert Primus, a member of the Surface Transportation Board, which approves rail mergers; and Alvin Brown, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.

He tried to fire Lisa Cook, the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve Board, but courts blocked him.

As the country has become more diverse racially, so have the federal government's upper ranks. The only two recent exceptions: Trump's first administration, and his second.

To him, white remains beautiful.

He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back.
It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Friday.
These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.” Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years.
In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.","The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and could do so as early as Oct. 31, according to a Friday court filing.

The Salvadoran national’s case has become a magnet for opposition to President Trump’s immigration crackdown since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement.

He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, the U.S. government has been seeking to deport him to various African countries.

A federal judge in Maryland had previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for its embarrassment over his mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security says that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English, its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights,” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing asserts. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Friday.

The court filing assessment is in contrast to a U.S. State Department report last year that detailed a human rights record in Liberia including extrajudicial killings, torture and serious restrictions on press freedom.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

In Chicago this week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents allegedly pointed a gun at a state representative and his staff on the city’s North Side. The next day, raids in the heavily Latino neighborhood of Little Village, in the city, and Cicero, a western suburb, led to arrests of two American citizens — staffers of a city alderman. One local leader called the raids a “brutal escalation” of the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement.

Nearly two months into ICE’s campaign in Chicago, disruptive, chaotic scenes like this are hardly surprising anymore. In recent weeks, agents have rappelled into an apartment building from a Black Hawk helicopter, fired pepper balls at peaceful protesters, and allegedly zip-tied the hands of children. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not commented in some of these instances, or they have said the officers’ actions were justified.

This spectacle of enforcement isn’t merely incidental. Part of the rationale for the administration’s intense posture has always been to terrify people into self-deportation, ProPublica noted in a report this week. The Chicago effort has included cinematic promotional videos of the aggressive, militarized campaign. An AFP fact check found that at least one White House video promoting the Chicago operation included footage from earlier enforcement across the country.

Meanwhile, in communities across Chicago, people are creating their own kind of commotion to slow down ICE. The sounds of whistles have periodically blanketed neighborhoods, as people monitor enforcement activity and alert others that agents are in the area. Those efforts have come alongside rapid response protests and court battles over whether agents have used excessive force on demonstrators.

Beneath all the commotion, though, the work of hardening the immigration system has been methodical. According to ICE, federal officers made more than 1,000 arrests over roughly the first month of the operation, sweeping up both new arrivals and long-time Chicagoans. Calls to Chicago-area legal assistance hotlines by families of people arrested by immigration authorities have “skyrocketed”. Many of those detained have been transferred to facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from their families and lawyers, and without hope for release while their immigration case is pending.

According to immigration lawyers, these outcomes reflect a deeper reshaping of the machinery of detention and deportation away from discretion and toward a singular focus: getting people out of the country as rapidly as possible, by any means necessary.

Historically, ICE agents at a local field office could consider the individual circumstances of a case — for example, whether an immigrant was a nursing mother or had serious medical conditions — in deciding whether to make them a priority for arrest.

“That discretion has totally evaporated,” said Sarah Cockrum, the supervising attorney at Beyond Legal Aid, a Chicago legal services organization representing people in immigration court. Now, Cockrum said, “there are children with cancer who are in detention — just really awful things.”

In fact, not only were agents previously allowed to consider such factors — under a memo issued at the beginning of the Biden Administration, they were required to consider all facts and circumstances in making arrest decisions. The memo stated that the “overriding question” in deciding whether to make an arrest was whether a noncitizen presented a public safety risk.

The Trump administration reversed that framework entirely just days after the president took office, essentially redefining discretion as the authority to detain and deport more quickly, rather than to weigh the individual facts of a person’s life.

Once ICE makes an arrest, the next place where officials have traditionally had some discretion is in the judicial branch. Days before DHS announced its operation in Chicago, however, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that immigration judges lack the authority to grant bond to anyone who entered the U.S. without authorization.

It’s not the only way the administration has sought to limit the power of judges. Since early summer, government lawyers in Chicago’s immigration court, and around the country, have increasingly asked judges to dismiss immigration cases, only for federal officers to arrest the immigrant after their hearing. In many cases, the government sought to deport the immigrant through expedited removal, a rapid process that happens without judicial review and had previously been used largely for people apprehended near the border who had been in the U.S. only a short time. In August, a federal judge paused the administration’s efforts to expand the use of expedited removal.

“One thing we're seeing is a big push to remove people from the immigration court system so that they don't get a chance to fight their case in court,” Cockrum said.

With fewer avenues for ICE officers or immigration judges to allow someone to remain in the U.S. or out of detention, immigrant-rights advocates have turned to the federal courts. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that ICE had violated a 2022 court-ordered agreement that limits ICE’s ability to make warrantless arrests in six midwestern states, including Illinois.

As ICE allegedly breaches existing legal protections and the administration looks for ways to write other protections out of existence, communities across the region are feeling the impact. In Niles, next to Chicago, 16-year-old Ofelia Torres, who is battling a rare and aggressive form of cancer, took to social media to plead for her father Reuben Torres Maldonado’s release. She described him as the “main parent who watches my brother while I stayed at the hospital.” Torres Maldonado is also the family’s primary breadwinner, the Chicago Tribune reported. He was arrested last weekend in a home improvement store parking lot.

Cockrum said that in the past, someone like Torres Maldonado — a father to a sick child, who had lived more than half his life in America, with only minor traffic offenses on his record — would have been exactly the type of person likely to be deprioritized for enforcement. If arrested, he likely would have been granted bond while his case proceeded.

Instead, a statement from administration officials dismissed legal efforts to free him as “nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country.” In the statement, officials said that he backed into a government vehicle while attempting to flee.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/cAayEM0nwi4jWu9g8b7tHG9LOCxs1AXQxoZZwtldNJE/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC8wdDdmdGl5MG44/Z2h5aDJubGI3bXJi/Y2prYTR5LzI1MTAy/NF9PSm9uZXNfQ2hp/Y2Fnb0lDRV9HZXR0/eUltYWdlcy5qcGc,N,,2025-10-26 11:17:09.179674

Ashanna Valle, who joined the crowd despite the rain, said she felt compelled to speak out.

“We have to stand up. We have to be here. We have to keep saying this is not right,” Valle said.

The rally came less than a week after federal agents detained 105 undocumented individuals in Wilder, according to community organizers. The raid, witnesses said, created panic and confusion as families were separated and many struggled to locate detained relatives.

Leo Morales, executive director of the ACLU of Idaho, said the event was meant to both show solidarity and share resources for affected families.

“Some family members continue to have challenges finding their loved ones who were detained,” Morales said. “There were machine guns there, with children who were zip-tied. Rubber bullets were used as well, and this was visible to all community members. It was a very traumatic event.”

Morales said counselors are being mobilized to help those coping with the trauma and that the ACLU is coordinating donations of food, clothing and financial support. Contributions are being accepted at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Boise and the Community Council of Idaho. Monetary donations can also be made at GiveButter.com/ifaf.

Interfaith groups, including Methodist, Mennonite and Catholic leaders, helped organize the event to provide emotional and spiritual support through prayer.

Reverend Karen Hernandez of the United Methodist Church said faith communities have a moral duty to stand with their immigrant neighbors.

“Our hearts are breaking for the entire immigrant and Latino community that are fearful — and that fear seems justified,” Hernandez said. “It makes it even more urgent for people of faith to stand up and support those neighbors.”

Community leaders are also calling on Gov. Brad Little to offer transparency and leadership in response to the raid.

Activists said the facility, which typically operates only Monday through Friday, called dozens of immigrants on Friday night and Saturday morning, instructing them to report for appointments Saturday.

Inside the building, advocates said, immigrants waited anxiously to learn whether they would be allowed to go home or be detained.

Lisa Knox, a lawyer and the leader of the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said some were forced to make heartbreaking choices.

“At one point, people were told they had to choose between seeing their families, seeing infants and saying goodbye before they were shipped off to detention, and talking to lawyers,” Knox said. ""They're not usually open on the weekends. It's very unusual. Usually, when people have appointments, they go in on a weekday. They're told months in advance when their next appointment would be so for people to get a call on Friday saying come in on Saturday is really unusual.""

Immigration rights activist Luis Magana said he came to the facility to support those summoned inside.

“That’s why activists are here—to see what happens,” Magana said. He noted that weekend check-ins limit immigrants’ access to legal support. “Some people I know are inside—they’re waiting for their appointment, and we expect they come out. We don’t know.""

Knox said that while many got to go back home after their appointments, not everyone did.

“We believe that around 25 people at least were detained today and are going to be sent to detention centers in the Central Valley,” Knox said. ""There was a young person who may be a minor and also a pregnant person.""

ABC10 reached out to ICE for comment and to confirm the reported detentions, but did not receive a response. Despite the tense atmosphere, Stockton police observed the protest from a distance, and it was mostly peaceful.

Activists said that more check-ins were scheduled for Sunday, and they plan to return to voice their concerns. Several lawyers also said they plan to be at the facility on Sunday to offer legal services to those in need.

“We know for now at least, ICE and CBP have called off large-scale raids in the Bay area, and it seems like they've decided to shift some of their capacity here,"" Knox said. ""We’re here to say that wherever they go, we’re going to go also. We’re going to support our community, our families and our loved ones.”

According to informed sources, the U.S. administration is drafting plans to overhaul the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), including replacing several senior field office directors nationwide.

The proposal stems from growing frustration within the White House and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over the slow pace of deportations—lagging behind Trump’s stated goal of deporting more than one million people by the end of his first year back in office.

Officials say the plan, which would reassign around six regional directors, has not yet been finalized.

This potential reshuffle highlights the administration’s ongoing struggle to fulfill Trump’s demand for a sweeping immigration crackdown — a policy cornerstone of his political agenda.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson declined to comment on the restructuring plans, but in a statement said:

“The President’s entire team is fully aligned in executing his immigration agenda — from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens. The results speak for themselves.”

Over 20 field office directors currently oversee deportation operations across the U.S., each responsible for wide regions that may include multiple states or major areas like Northern California.

These regional leaders have faced mounting pressure to ramp up arrests. ICE has already replaced two acting directors and several senior officials amid Trump’s push for faster deportations.

Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior ICE official under the Biden administration, said:

“They’re under constant threat; people are being crushed. It’s a culture of fear. There’s been so much turnover that I can’t imagine anyone is able to take on the real challenges.”

The DHS reports that since Trump returned to office, over 400,000 people have been deported, with a target of 600,000 total deportations by the end of his first year.

However, those numbers can be misleading. Individuals turned back at the border or entry points are counted as deportees — even if they never actually entered or lived in the U.S.

Earlier this year, Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, met with senior ICE leaders in Washington to discuss ways to accelerate deportations. Shortly afterward, he appeared on Fox News, announcing ICE’s goal of 3,000 arrests per day.

Following his comments, daily arrests briefly climbed above 2,000 — but have since declined, with ICE unable to meet Miller’s benchmark. Even so, the agency has continued detaining over 1,000 migrants per day throughout the summer.

The New York Times reported that ICE’s deportation operations are time-intensive. Historically, the agency prided itself on targeted enforcement against specific individuals, not broad sweeps that cause panic in communities and ensnare bystanders.

Now, ICE agents are devoting massive time and resources to surveillance and raids, making it difficult to hit the administration’s high deportation quotas.

Agency data show that more than 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention — a sharp increase. ICE has been granted extra funding to expand detention capacity to over 100,000 migrants. Its annual budget was boosted to $28 billion under a domestic policy bill Trump signed earlier this year.

With ICE arrests lagging, U.S. Border Patrol agents have taken a greater role in enforcement — conducting workplace inspections at major retailers and even large-scale raids at residential complexes in cities like Chicago. Meanwhile, ICE continues to focus on narrower, case-by-case operations.",https://www.mizanonline.ir/files/en/news/2025/10/25/14269_290.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:00.507960

The court filing said that Abrego Garcia could be sent to the West African nation as soon as Oct. 31 to fulfill a standing deportation order against him.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March despite a 2019 protection finding and a court order barring his removal to his home country. His case has become a focal point in the clash between Trump’s hardline deportation agenda and Democratic efforts to block removals.

The filing noted that Abrego Garcia’s attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would prosecute or torture him if he were removed there and that Liberia is not on that list.

“Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent,” the filing said.

The filing said the country’s national language is English, its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights,” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees.”

DHS said in the filing that it has received diplomatic assurances from Liberia about the humane treatment of people removed there.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia requests asylum in attempt to prevent deportation to Uganda

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia blasted the administration’s latest move as political retribution, arguing the latest deportation plan is part of a pattern of punitive deportation tactics.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement, according to The Associated Press.

“Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option,” the lawyer added. “Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a staunch supporter of Abrego Garcia, condemned the latest filing on Friday. Van Hollen flew to El Salvador in April in a publicized visit to meet Abrego Garcia in prison and has led the effort to get him released.

“The Trump Administration has been desperately shopping for faraway countries they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to in order to deny his constitutional due process right to defend himself against the charges they have brought,” Van Hollen said in a statement.

“Clearly, Trump’s cronies want to avoid answering for the claim that they are engaged in a vindictive prosecution against Abrego Garcia, after a federal judge concluded earlier this month that his prosecution ‘may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS due to Abrego’s successful challenge of his unlawful deportation in Maryland.’ Kilmar must be allowed his day in court to fight for his rights,” the senator said.

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and was issued a deportation order in 2019. Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13.

Trump administration officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although some top Trump officials said he was correctly removed and contended he’s a member of the notorious MS-13 gang.

One immigration judge in 2019 found that Garcia had not sufficiently refuted evidence of MS-13 affiliation and was thus removable to anywhere other than El Salvador because of a threat from a rival gang.

The latest move to deport him comes as Abrego Garcia remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania. A federal judge in Maryland previously barred his immediate deportation while reviewing claims that the government is retaliating against him for successfully challenging his wrongful removal earlier this year.

The same judge wrote in an October order that his prosecution “may stem from retaliation by the DOJ and DHS,” while a separate case in Tennessee over human smuggling charges is still pending.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-qq79mz6zi-1761418049448.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761403663&w=1200,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:04.836727

It was the latest death to occur in an operation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on people residing unlawfully in the United States.

The man, Josue Castro-Rivera, 24, of Honduras, was found dead by responding Virginia State Police officers on Interstate 264 in Norfolk on Thursday morning, state police said. He had been struck by a pickup truck.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had stopped Mr. Castro-Rivera’s vehicle as part of a targeted operation, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. When the officers moved to detain the vehicle’s occupants after determining they were in the country illegally, Mr. Castro-Rivera fled the scene on foot and entered the busy highway.

“One of our ICE officers administered CPR to Castro-Rivera in an attempt to keep him alive,” the D.H.S. spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, Castro-Rivera perished. The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased. He then grieved and prayed with them.”

(Minnesota Reformer) — Hundreds gathered outside the federal Whipple Building at Fort Snelling Friday to protest the presence of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants.

Noem held a press conference to tout the administration’s arrests of immigrants who have committed crimes. She spoke behind a table piled with seized firearms and bags of marijuana, meth and fentanyl.

Many protesters feared Noem’s presence signaled the beginning of a large-scale immigration enforcement effort like the one launched in Chicago last month.

But Noem’s appearance focused instead on celebrating arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s St. Paul field office.

“I’m here today to ask all of the people in Minnesota, all of the people in the Midwest and throughout our country, to support your law enforcement officers, to support them and help protect them as they go out and do their job,” Noem said.

Dozens of clergy members attended the protest, leading demonstrators through songs like “This Little Light of Mine” and “We Shall Not Be Moved.”

Craig Loya, a bishop at Episcopal Church in Minnesota, preached a message of inclusion.

“As long as I have breath, I will continue to preach and proclaim that diversity makes us stronger and that there is no clearer moral imperative than standing with the immigrant and the outsider, because that is how God has embraced every single one of us,” Loya said.

Protesters demonstrated right up to the Whipple Building’s glass doors, with many holding signs and shouting anti-ICE chants.

“No more Minnesota nice. We won’t want your fascist ICE,” the protesters chanted.

The chants did not reach the windowless room of the Whipple Building where Noem spoke.

When asked whether President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard or other federal law enforcement to the Twin Cities, Noem said “it’s up to the president.”

But thousands of newly-trained ICE officers are expected to join field offices in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul, paid for by funding approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, Noem said.

Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.

Immigration agents detained a roofing crew in St. Paul on Oct. 3. The officers arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to advocates. Some wore masks.

Asked about the incident, Noem said “our agents always follow exactly what the law is and what the regulation and the protocol is for every single operation that they’re out on, so they are always identifying themselves and making sure that people know who they are.”

A handful of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers also attended the protest, including DFL state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, who said she was at the protest to send a message to Noem that she and ICE weren’t welcome in Minnesota.

“We know a lot of what they do — the point is just fear,” Sencer-Mura said. “Always trying to combat that with love and community is a good way to just show up.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2025/10/mg-5354-1536x1024-1-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:09.820951

Jose Castro-Rivera was in a vehicle that was stopped on I-264 eastbound in Virginia around 11 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to Virginia State Police, who were responding to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash at the Military Highway interchange.

When they arrived, troopers found an adult male who had been hit by a 2002 Ford pickup truck. The man was identified as Rivera, and was pronounced dead at the scene.

A preliminary investigation by VSP found that he was “fleeing from a pursuit initiated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when he exited his vehicle and attempted to cross the interstate.”

Officials from VSP were not involved in the pursuit but are investigating the pedestrian crash, which remains under investigation.

A spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said ICE stopped the vehicle in which the Honduran national was traveling as “part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.”

“Upon determining that the occupants were in the United States illegally, officers began detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle. However, one of the vehicle’s occupants, Jose Castro-Rivera, resisted heavily and fled the scene onto a busy highway, creating a significant safety risk to himself and the general public,” the agency said. “Unfortunately, a passing vehicle struck Castro-Rivera.”

One of the ICE officers gave Castro-Rivera CPR before he died, the DHS spokesperson said.

“The officer then informed the three detained aliens that their friend had deceased,” the DHS spokesperson said.

Jose Castro Rivera was killed on Thursday morning after running onto a busy highway and being struck and fatally injured while trying to evade ICE agents, local authorities said.

A Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News that ICE agents stopped a vehicle as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation” but did not provide further details about Castro Rivera, or any of the other passengers who were detained but survived the operation. An ICE agent administered CPR to Castro Rivera, but he died at the scene, according to the official.

The fatal incident took place on the busy Interstate 264 eastbound at the Military Highway interchange in Norfolk in south-east Virginia. The Virginia state police said they were not involved in the pursuit and the fatal crash remains under investigation.

This is the third known deadly incident involving immigrants trying to flee immigration raids by masked, armed federal agents that are spreading across the country, as part of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrants and unprecedented expansion of ICE.

In August, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala was killed on the freeway after fleeing an ICE raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, about 20 miles (32km) north-east of downtown Los Angeles. The home improvement retailer, which has long been a meeting spot for employers to recruit documented and undocumented day laborers as roofers, painters and construction workers, has been targeted by the Trump administration for ICE operations.

The Guatemalan man’s death came just a month after another deadly ICE raid in southern California.

Mexican farm worker Jaime Alanís García, 56, died after falling 30ft (9 meters) from a greenhouse while fleeing federal agents at the state-licensed Glass House Farms cannabis facility in Camarillo, Ventura county. Alanís García, who had been living and working in the US for about three decades to support his family in Michoacán, Mexico, climbed onto the roof in a desperate effort to get away from the masked ICE agents and national guard soldiers during the July raid, in which more than 300 people were detained. He suffered catastrophic injuries and was taken off life support after two days.

Trump and his anti-immigrant advisers have repeatedly claimed that the unprecedented resources and power being gifted to ICE is about removing “illegal criminals” off American streets.

Yet official government data shows that immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in US immigration detention. The number of people with no criminal history arrested by ICE and detained by the Trump administration has surpassed the number of those charged with crimes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093220ec316f230fe8c43b1ccba66334f9104f8c/846_0_5417_4335/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3de615a66d27428a2a78dfa3e4869f62",N,,2025-10-25 18:16:43.571832

As such, the Government would need to immediately file notice of intent to transfer Petitioner to a long-term facility outside of Massachusetts.
As such, ICE respectfully requests this Court modify its Order to allow the relief requested by Petitioner - a return to an appropriate facility in New Jersey.
And, she continued, ICE should not be rewarded for disregarding ""the court's authority"" and the explicit order O'Toole signed to have her client returned to Massachusetts.
Here, Petitioner's habeas petition remains pending, and she continues to require communication and in-person access with Massachusetts counsel.","Yesterday, two days after a federal judge in Boston ordered ICE to ""immediately"" ship a woman it had stuck in a cell in a Texas prison back to Massachusetts, ICE asked if it could instead ship her to a prison in New Jersey - once it gets a cell cleared for her - acknowledging its ad-hoc prison in a Burlington office park is not designed for long-term imprisonment, what with its lack of medical facilities and a room for inmates to meet with their attorneys.

In a reply, Mirian Abarca Tixe's attorney asked what part of ""immediately"" ICE failed to understand, and asked US District Judge George O'Toole to step in, again, and get the Ecuadorean immigrant closer to her so that they can better prepare for her legal battle to be released altogether as she fights to stay in the US.

As of this afternoon, O'Toole had yet to respond.

In its request, filed around 5 p.m. on Friday, ICE's lawyers - at the US Attorney's office in Boston - noted that when ICE initially grabbed Abarca Tixe at what she thought was a routine check-in at Burlington on Aug. 21, they at first kept here there, then, with her lawyer's consent, shipped her to a prison in New Jersey because ICE doesn't have any facilities for long-term imprisonment of women in Massachusetts.

But that move was contingent on ICE agreeing to notify a Boston judge should she be moved again, only ICE then shipped her to Texas without telling a judge here - raising questions whether ICE was really serious about not interfering with the woman's legal battle, and making it difficult for her to get ""a fair and orderly consideration"" of her habeas-corpus request by shipping her 1,700 miles way, O'Toole wrote in a ruling Wednesday.

In his ruling, O'Toole said ICE not only had to get Abarca Tixe out of Texas, it had ""to immediately return the petitioner to a proper facility located within the District of Massachusetts.""

In its motion, filed around 5 p.m. on Friday, ICE attorneys asked O'Toole to modify his order to allow her to be sent no further north than New Jersey, which it said should be more than acceptable since Abarca Tixe's attorney had previously said that was OK, although her request was for either return to New Jersey ""or another mutually acceptable facility readily accessible to her current Massachusetts counsel.""

As grounds for this request, ICE contends that there is not a proper facility located within Massachusetts for to house Petitioner for more than a temporary period. ...

If Petitioner was transferred back to Massachusetts, Petitioner would be detained temporarily at the ICE field Office in Burlington which does not contain many of the accommodations needed to house and care for individuals for any extended period of detention and does not contain medical facilities or dedicated attorney client meeting space. As such, the Government would need to immediately file notice of intent to transfer Petitioner to a long-term facility outside of Massachusetts. As such, ICE respectfully requests this Court modify its Order to allow the relief requested by Petitioner - a return to an appropriate facility in New Jersey.

But in her reply, filed about an hour later, Abarca Tixe's attorney, Elizabeth Shaw of Boston, argued O'Toole made himself pretty clear in his order and that given the issue of Burlington's suitability as a prison had come up earlier in the case, he made no mistake when he specified Massachusetts.

The Court's October 22 Order was clear and unambiguous. Respondents' claim that Massachusetts lacks an “appropriate facility” simply repeats arguments already made and rejected in earlier filings. This Court has already considered the government's administrative concerns and determined that they do not override the Petitioner's rights or the Court's authority to enforce its orders. Motions for modification cannot serve as a vehicle to reargue matters that have been previously resolved. ...

She cited a 2009 appeals case in Boston that concluded judges ""should not reconsider prior decisions unless there is newly discovered evidence, an intervening change in law, or clear error.""

""None is present here,"" she wrote.

And, she continued, ICE should not be rewarded for disregarding ""the court's authority"" and the explicit order O'Toole signed to have her client returned to Massachusetts.

Now, Respondents once again seek to move Petitioner out of this District - despite a standing Order to the contrary. To grant this motion would not only endorse noncompliance but would erode this Court's ability to ensure meaningful judicial review of habeas proceedings. ...

The government's failure to act swiftly or to seek a stay pending resolution of its motion constitutes a waiver of its right to relief. This delay, coupled with prior noncompliance, further evidences bad faith and weighs heavily against any equitable modification.

And she wrote that O'Toole's order was a recognition that even bringing her back to part of the Northeast rather than to Massachusetts would still harm her legal efforts:

The Court's October 22 Order was expressly designed to protect Petitioner's access to her Massachusetts-based counsel. Relocating her to New Jersey would substantially interfere with that access - precisely the harm the Court sought to prevent.

She added that ""the Supreme Court has long recognized that meaningful access to counsel and to the courts is a fundamental right of detained persons"" and that federal judges in Boston have taken that into account in this year's immigration cases.

Here, Petitioner's habeas petition remains pending, and she continues to require communication and in-person access with Massachusetts counsel. Any transfer outside this District would directly impair those rights, violating both the letter and the spirit of this Court's prior orders.",https://www.universalhub.com/images/alogosmall2.png,N,,2025-10-25 21:01:28.445508

DHS said that one driver attempted to ram a vehicle. All three drivers were taken into custody, according to DHS.

The third incident allegedly involved a member of the Latin Kings gang. DHS said that U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) was targeted by a U.S. citizen who was ""displaying an anti-ICE flag."" Alexis Correa, who DHS claimed was the driver and a member of the Latin Kings, allegedly followed agents for several miles before attempting to ram the vehicle. USBP was able to evade Correa, who then allegedly hit another civilian vehicle. DHS said Correa was arrested under 18 U.S. Code 111, which makes it a federal crime to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with certain federal officials.

Also on Wednesday, CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers arrested a U.S. citizen, identified by DHS as Alexander Torres. He is accused of ""recklessly impeding operations and tailing government vehicles."" According to DHS, he ignored multiple commands from officers to stop and ""eventually boxed in government vehicles in an alleyway.""

HUNDREDS OF FEDERAL AGENTS IN CHICAGO CARRY OUT OPERATION TARGETING SUSPECTED TREN DE ARAGUA GANG MEMBERS

DHS said that Correa and Torres had criminal records. According to the department, Correa's record includes convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm, destroying evidence and a DUI. Torres' record allegedly includes convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm by a gang member, DHS said.

In the fifth incident, USBP encountered three illegal immigrants from Mexico who DHS said were ""in violation of our nation's immigration laws.""

The illegal immigrants allegedly refused to comply with agents' verbal commands to exit their vehicle. The driver, who DHS identified as Jose Mauricio Rosas-Hernandez, allegedly ""reversed into a government vehicle and scraped another USBP unit."" DHS said that one agent was struck in the knee while chasing the suspects on foot. According to DHS, the three illegal immigrants were taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

""Secretary Noem’s message to the rioters is clear: You will not stop us or slow us down. CBP and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" McLaughlin said.

Operation Midway Blitz was launched last month in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run allegedly caused by Julio Cucul-Bol, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala. DHS stated the goal of the operation was to ""target criminal illegal aliens terrorizing Americans in sanctuary Illinois.""

Abraham and her friend, Chloe Polzin, were at a stoplight when a suspected drunk driver struck their car and fled.

Democrats say any state funding directed to direct benefits would be supplemental to SNAP but not considered formal benefits.
The refusal to tap the contingency fund to pay benefits, however, is another story.
And SNAP supporters — advocate groups and Democrats, alike — have argued for weeks that any effort by the administration to withhold contingency funds would be illegal.
Those accusations only escalated Friday night after the news of the USDA memo surfaced.","Top House Democrats tore into the Trump administration on Friday night for withholding available food aid for millions of low-income Americans, saying the decision is both callous and illegal.

“It is a disgusting dereliction of duty that the Trump administration would knowingly rip food out of the mouths of 42 million children, seniors and veterans,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is sitting on more than $5 billion in a contingency fund earmarked by Congress to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in emergencies. But the department says it won’t use those funds to cover benefits if the government shutdown extends beyond Oct. 31, according to multiple news reports.

In a memo, first reported by Axios, the USDA said the reason is simple: The contingency fund was designed to respond to emergencies, like natural disasters, and the current shutdown doesn’t qualify because it was manufactured by Democrats. To spend the money on SNAP benefits during such an event, the USDA said, would be illegal.

“[T]he contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,” the memo reads.

The memo contradicts the shutdown plan posted by USDA earlier in the year, which stated that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operation should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown.”

The plan has since been deleted.

The new policy also stipulates that the USDA will not reimburse states that seek to fill the void with their own funding for food aid during the shutdown.

“There is no provision or allowance under current law for States to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,” the memo says.

The reimbursement policy is not controversial. Democrats say any state funding directed to direct benefits would be supplemental to SNAP but not considered formal benefits.

The refusal to tap the contingency fund to pay benefits, however, is another story. And SNAP supporters — advocate groups and Democrats, alike — have argued for weeks that any effort by the administration to withhold contingency funds would be illegal.

Those accusations only escalated Friday night after the news of the USDA memo surfaced.

In a joint statement, Reps. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, and Angie Craig (Minn.), the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, said the policy is not only a violation of the law, but a “cruel” attack on poor Americans.

“This is perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet — freezing funding already enacted into law to feed hungry Americans while he shovels tens of billions of dollars out the door to Argentina and into his ballroom,” the pair said in a statement.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/jeffrieshakeem_102425gn07_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 17:56:45.467601

ABOUT NCLA NCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group founded by prominent legal scholar Philip Hamburger to protect constitutional freedoms from violations by the Administrative State.","Washington, DC, Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The New Civil Liberties Alliance, on behalf of itself and its clients in two pending lawsuits against the emergency tariffs, filed an amici curiae brief today at the U.S. Supreme Court in the consolidated Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections tariff cases. NCLA urges the Justices to rule that President Trump’s orders imposing tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are unlawful, because the text of that law does not authorize any tariffs.

As NCLA has argued since filing Simplified v. Trump—the first lawsuit ever brought against the IEEPA emergency tariff orders—IEEPA never mentions tariffs, so it cannot authorize the President to enact them in declared emergencies. NCLA represents Simplified, Kilo Brava, Bambola, Rokland, FIREDISC, and the Game Manufacturers Association on the amici brief, which are NCLA’s clients in Simplified and the similar FIREDISC v. Trump lawsuit. NCLA’s brief specifically asks the Court to reject the Government’s dangerous and absurd argument that “… regulate … importation or exportation of … property …” means “tariff.”

The President does not possess any inherent executive authority to impose tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in V.O.S. Selections that IEEPA does not authorize the specific tariffs President Trump has levied. A concurrence in that case held that all such tariffs are unlawful, and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had reached the same conclusion earlier in Learning Resources. NCLA believes the Supreme Court must adopt the view of the V.O.S. Selections concurrence and the Learning Resources ruling, determining that IEEPA does not give the President power to issue unilateral tariffs on Americans. The Justices should also rule that federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear these cases, since IEEPA is not a tariff statute.

NCLA released the following statements:

“The Supreme Court should rule that the President lacks the authority to order emergency tariffs of any kind—a ruling that will restore Congress’s control over tariffs and discourage future presidential overreach.”

— Andrew Morris, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“Congress didn’t give the President tariff power under IEEPA. The Supreme Court can preserve the proper place of separation of powers by saying so.”

— John Vecchione, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“If, as the Government has requested, the Supreme Court decides that the word ‘regulate’ means ‘tariff,’ it would open a Pandora’s Box of mischief. Doing so would unleash bureaucrats throughout the Administrative State to find other laws containing the word ‘regulate’ that would let them tax Americans.”

— Mark Chenoweth, President, NCLA

He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back.
It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.
These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.” Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.
In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.","The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia, and could do so as early as Oct. 31, according to a Friday court filing.

The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings. In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Abrego_Garcia_AP_25249595037449_NAT_0906,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:11.085622
,Agencies,2025-10-25 18:30:19+00:00,The Verge,ICE is building a social media panopticon - The Verge,Emma Roth,,,,,https://www.theverge.com/policy/806425/ice-social-media-surveillance-free-speech-assault,"The “real-time intelligence” platform is capable of ingesting and analyzing vast amounts of publicly available data, like social media posts, according to its website.
But with billions of dollars in funding, ICE has the budget to employ an array of social media monitoring tools that could lead to arrests and deportations across the country.
“With billions of dollars to spend on spyware, it’s extremely alarming to think how far ICE will go in surveilling social media,” Owen says.
The Trump administration’s social media surveillance plans extend beyond ICE, with Citizenship and Immigration Services proposing an initiative that would require people applying for US citizenship or personal residency to provide their social media account handles.
The US government has already started trawling social media for posts that don’t align with the Trump administration’s viewpoints.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement carries out raids across the country, the agency is working rapidly to expand an online surveillance system that could potentially track millions of users on the web. Federal records uncovered by The Lever reveal that ICE is paying $5.7 million to use an AI-powered social media monitoring platform called Zignal Labs, something Will Owen, the communications director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), calls an “assault” on democracy and free speech.

The “real-time intelligence” platform is capable of ingesting and analyzing vast amounts of publicly available data, like social media posts, according to its website. In a pamphlet shared by The Lever, Zignal Labs says it uses machine learning, computer vision, and optical character recognition to analyze more than 8 billion posts per day in over 100 languages. This allows it to process and sort data into “curated detection feeds” that ICE could use to flag individuals for deportation.

The pamphlet highlights Zignal’s ability to capture geolocated images and videos while providing alerts and information to “operators.” One example states that Zignal Labs used its technology to analyze a Telegram video showing “the precise location of an ongoing operation in Gaza.” The company says its tool identified emblems and patches to “confirm the operators involved,” allowing it to notify operators on the ground. That means ICE could potentially trace someone’s location based on the location attached to a video posted on TikTok, or even a picture on Facebook.

ICE procured the contract with Zignal Labs through Carahsoft, a firm that deploys IT solutions for government agencies. Zignal Labs most recently partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to analyze weather events from public and online media sources. It also inked a contract with the US Secret Service in 2019 and works with the Department of Defense and Department of Transportation, according to The Lever. The Verge reached out to Zignal Labs with a request for more information about its contract with ICE but didn’t immediately hear back.

Surveillance on social media isn’t anything new. In 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union found that police were using a CIA-backed tool called Geofeedia to track protesters of police brutality across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. But with billions of dollars in funding, ICE has the budget to employ an array of social media monitoring tools that could lead to arrests and deportations across the country.

“With billions of dollars to spend on spyware, it’s extremely alarming to think how far ICE will go in surveilling social media,” Owen says. “ICE is a lawless agency that will use AI-driven social media monitoring not only to terrorize immigrant families, but also to target activists fighting back against their abuses. This is an assault on our democracy and right to free speech, powered by the algorithm and paid for with our tax dollars.”

“The scale of this spying is matched by an equally massive chilling effect on free speech.”

Earlier this month, a report from Wired revealed that ICE plans to hire almost 30 workers to comb through content on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, and other social platforms to “locate individuals who pose a danger to national security, public safety, and/or otherwise meet ICE’s law enforcement mission.”

A document seen by Wired shows that ICE is requesting information from contractors who could help the agency carry out the initiative, which may even require workers to search for data about a target’s family members, friends, or coworkers to pinpoint their whereabouts for ICE officers. The document notes that ICE would place around 12 contractors in a monitoring facility in Vermont, while 16 staff members would work in California, with some required to be available “at all times.”

David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells The Verge that automated and AI-powered monitoring tools will give the government the ability to “monitor social media for viewpoints it doesn’t like on a scale that was never possible with human review alone.” Greene adds, “The scale of this spying is matched by an equally massive chilling effect on free speech.”

Outside social media, 404 Media reports that ICE has tapped into license plate-scanning security cameras, as well as gained access to a tool that tracks the movement of millions of phones.

The Trump administration’s social media surveillance plans extend beyond ICE, with Citizenship and Immigration Services proposing an initiative that would require people applying for US citizenship or personal residency to provide their social media account handles. In 2019, the State Department began requiring some visa applicants to list their social media handles on sites they’ve used within the past year, but the agency expanded it to include more kinds of nonimmigrant visas in June.

The US government has already started trawling social media for posts that don’t align with the Trump administration’s viewpoints. In March, it began an AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” initiative to track down posts from student visa holders that appear to be in support of Hamas or other designated terror organizations. The State Department also announced earlier this month that it revoked the visas of six people who the US claimed “celebrated” the shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk. This week, ICE arrested nine street vendors on New York City’s Canal Street shortly after a conservative influencer tagged ICE in a post showing vendors in the area.

But now, with a powerful AI social media monitoring tool in the hands of ICE, the agency won’t need influencers to flag individuals for deportation — and it will only get riskier to speak freely on the internet.

“This is another example of Big Tech CEOs partnering with an increasingly authoritarian federal government as part of Trump’s ongoing attempts to clamp down on free speech,” Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, tells The Verge. “This should terrify and anger every American.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/STK471_Government_Surveillance_CVirginia_B-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:24.368431

It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.
Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.” And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities.
As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.
“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has inked a new $5.7 million contract for AI-driven social media surveillance software, according to federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.

The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.

An informational pamphlet marked confidential but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over 8 billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company says, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”

The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the U.S. Secret Service, signing its first contract for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.

But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s intelligence unit, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.

Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.

Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities after being doxed online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like Canary Mission. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a right-wing influencer posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.

Last week, a group of labor unions sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”

And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As Wired reported earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.

Advocates told The Lever that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.

“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”

“Tactical Intelligence” to Israel and the Pentagon

Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially catered to public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.

But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries, formally announcing the new focus, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One Zignal pamphlet from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the U.S. Marines and the State Department.

Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.

The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an individual’s online activity, and Babel X, which links social media profiles and location information to a target’s Social Security number.

“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.

This week, ICE signed a $7 million contract with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had hired Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”

Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post announcing the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.

ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241666955-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 16:01:15.288348

Kristi Noem on immigration enforcement in Minnesota

What we know:

In the press conference, Noem gave details on recent arrests made by Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota.

According to Noem, the individuals were arrested for either homicide, human trafficking or sexual assault.

Noem praised the work of USCIS in the state, who, under operation ""Twin Shield"", has been investigating visa fraud in Minnesota.

At the press conference, Noem condemned ""violent protests, violent attacks, riots and attacks on law enforcement,"" and is encouraging Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to have a partnership with DHS law enforcement.

Noem said that it is up to the President if the National Guard will be deployed here, but did say there would be an ""increase"" in federal officers coming.

""It's up to the President on if he believes the National Guard should be deployed to any situation to any city across our country,"" Noem said at the press conference. ""But we do have an increase of federal officers that will be coming. As you know, we had a big bill passed through Congress that allocated 10,000 new ICE officers across the country.""

Noem said Minnesota will see ""dozens"" of new agents and federal officers.

Trump Administration and Minnesota

Local perspective:

Earlier this month, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz raised the possibility of the Trump Administration deploying federal troops to Minnesota, like the administration has in Chicago.

""I think it makes — it would be logical for them to come here. We fall into exactly what it looks like they’re trying to target — blue cities in places that he wants to make an impact. You can certainly chill voting in states like Minnesota if you target Minneapolis and St. Paul,"" Walz said at an event with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker hosted by the Star Tribune.

Walz said his administration has been preparing for the possibility of troop deployments in Minnesota since last year.

Immigration crackdowns nationwide

Dig deeper:

The Trump Administration deployed National Guard members to Illinois earlier this month as the administration ramped up immigration enforcement in Chicago. President Trump has also repeatedly criticized Chicago and asserted that crime in that city is out of control.

Trump was also set to deploy federal agents to San Francisco this week to quell crime, but backed off this plan after talking to the mayor.

Minneapolis and St. Paul's mayors respond to Noem's visit

Local perspective:

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with city leaders, recorded a message on the city's stance on immigration, ahead of the press conference with Noem.

The message can be watched in full above, but Frey stated the city is committed to upholding its Separation Ordinance, which ensures that city employees, including police and firefighters, are not allowed to participate in civil immigration enforcement.

""Minneapolis doesn’t flinch when it comes to our values,"" said Frey. ""We stand with our immigrant neighbors — not just in words, but in the laws we’ve passed, the policies we enforce, and the way we show up for each other every day.""

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter shared the following statement regarding Noem's presence in the Twin Cities:

""We're aware federal employees, including ICE and border patrol agents, are converging in the Twin Cities ahead of Kristi Noem's speech today in Minneapolis. Though we aren't aware of planned enforcement activity, I understand and share concerns about what this could signal.

""Remember you have rights. We encourage everyone to review the following information for what to do if you are stopped by federal law enforcement, how to safely and legally document proceedings in progress, and who to call for legal assistance.

""As a reminder, Saint Paul police officers will always identify themselves. They wear clearly marked SPPD uniforms, display their badges, and, when relevant, produce a warrant. Our officers will help de-escalate situations when possible. And they do not wear face coverings.""

Community leaders gather in protest of Noem's visit

The other side:

The People's Action Coalition Against Trump gathered to protest Noem's visit to the Twin Cities. The group is rallying against having a larger ICE presence and the National Guard being sent to the state.

(WAVY) — Officials have identified the man who died Thursday morning after being struck by a vehicle while fleeing from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Interstate 264 in Norfolk.

According to Virginia State Police, the incident happened just after 11 a.m. on I-264 eastbound near the Military Highway interchange. Troopers said a man exited his vehicle and tried to cross the interstate during a pursuit with ICE officers when he was struck by a 2002 Ford pickup truck and pronounced dead at the scene.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson identified the man as Jose Castro-Rivera of Honduras. The spokesperson called the incident “tragic,” adding it “could have been prevented had Castro-Rivera complied with our officers.” The spokesperson also said ICE officers had determined the people in the vehicle were in the United States illegally, which led to them “detaining the occupants of the targeted vehicle.”

Community leaders close to Castro-Rivera tell 10 On Your Side he was 24-years-old.

In a follow-up statement, ICE said Castro-Rivera “resisted heavily” and that “the death of this illegal alien is a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission.”

The agency said the vehicle stop was “part of a targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.”

Immigration attorney Andrew Reigel of Virginia Beach criticized that statement, saying it unfairly places blame on the victim.

“They’re making the unfortunate deceased person the bad guy here,” Reigel said. “He was probably fearful for his life, and in that moment thought maybe this was a safer option, … which should tell you quite a bit about the situation.”

Reigel said ICE’s current enforcement practices differ from those under previous administrations.

“Previous administrations had focused on immigrants with criminal records, knowing resources are limited,” he said. “Now, just simply being here, paying taxes and working isn’t enough. … People are being detained and placed in facilities comparable to jails.”

Patricia Bracknell, founder and CEO of the Chamber for Hispanic Progress, said her organization is working directly with Castro-Rivera’s family to provide assistance.

“They have been very involved since this morning,” Bracknell said. “The Honduran consulate in Washington, D.C., has agreed to pay for his body to be sent back to Honduras and help the family through the paperwork process.”

Bracknell said local community members have also launched a fundraising effort to support the family.

She added that while the group is not opposed to immigration enforcement, they are concerned about what they describe as aggressive and unjust tactics.

“We’re seeing normal residents… people who live in our communities and are working, … being picked up and disappearing,” Bracknell said. “There’s no due process. What we are not supportive of are the tactics.”

Bracknell questioned whether racial profiling played a role in recent immigration stops.

“This particular case raises that question,” she said. “They’re driving while Latino… is racial profiling an issue now? I’m a U.S. citizen, but I look Latina.”

Reigel said he’s heard similar reports.

“What we’ve seen earlier this year is that ICE was targeting work trucks, … anything that appeared to be a white work truck with Hispanic passengers,” he said.",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-24T204733.870.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 14:56:54.611829

The NYCLU and The Door filed an emergency lawsuit after the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained the Bronx high school junior identified in court papers only as “EJCC.”

His attorneys say he has special immigration juvenile status, which is a protection for minors a court has found to have been abused or abandoned and who cannot safely return home.

“Our contention is that the order cannot apply with him being granted special immigrant juvenile status because it would completely upend the statutory scheme of SIJ,” Gyori said.

The teen and his mother fled gang violence in Ecuador in 2022.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, a federal judge ordered their removal in February 2024.

The teen’s mother, fearing detention, self-deported last month.

In a statement, DHS says the boy “will be reunited with family.”

“He had already had a family court finding that his father had abandoned him as a child and that is in his best interest to stay in the country,” Gyori said.

The Salvadoran national’s case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings.

Tim Walz will not.

Noem addressed the room behind a table piled with zip-tied firearms and several plastic bags of methamphetamine, said to be seized from operations conducted by the agencies. Alongside her stood two signs: both mugshots of men, which read “Arrested: Mexican Child Sexual Assault,” and another read “Arrested: Salvadorian Human Trafficker.”

Outside of the building, almost a thousand protestors gathered to chant and deliver speeches. After the conference concluded at around 5:30 p.m., most protesters left with a few remaining for follow-on protests.

Drew Harmon, with the group MN50501, said he has a personal grudge against Noem because of how she leads ICE agents and security in the country.

“Kristi Noem is the mouthpiece in the face of that movement right now,” Harmon said. “She is not just perpetuating it. She’s also enabling it by being a ‘yes’ woman for Donald Trump.”

He added that people will be ready if the National Guard, alongside ICE agents, sets foot in Minneapolis.

“They have it out for Minnesota. They have it out for the Twin Cities,” Harmon said.

In her address, Noem thanked local leaders such as Sam Westbay with Homeland Security Investigations in St. Paul and Regional Enforcement Removal Operations director David Easterwood for their work deporting immigrants in Minnesota.

Noem said in her address that Mayor Jacob Frey has allowed more criminals to “get away” with their crimes. She added that violence against police officers has increased by “1000%” due to them being “demonized” by leaders in Washington, D.C.

“If you get the chance today, thank someone who defends our laws,” Noem said.

Noem mentioned Operation Twin Shield, an operation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which worked specifically with visa fraud, which she said has been “rampant in these cities.”

“The fraud operation that has gone out and investigated those who maybe came into this country under wrong paperwork or overstayed and refused to leave, and they utilized fraud to do so,” Noem said.

Noem added that dozens of agents will be coming to field offices in the region. There are USCIS field offices in both Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“If you’re here illegally, go home,” Noem said in her address.

She added that around 1.6 million have supposedly self-deported or been detained, then deported. If people choose to leave, Noem said the federal government will give them $1000 to buy their plane ticket to return to their home country.

“Those who break the law face the consequences of that and get removed from the country,” Noem said.

Numerous Minneapolis city leaders reaffirmed their stance on the city’s values and separation ordinance, which prohibits all city employees, such as police and firefighters, from participating in ICE activities.

Frey said in a press release that he will continue to support the city’s ongoing commitments to keep neighborhoods safe, ensuring residents are informed about their rights and supporting immigrants within the city.

“Minneapolis doesn’t flinch when it comes to our values,” said Frey in the statement. “We stand with our immigrant neighbors — not just in words, but in the laws we’ve passed, the policies we enforce, and the way we show up for each other every day.”

In a video standing alongside city leaders, Frey explained that under the separation ordinance, people can access city programs and emergency services regardless of immigration status.

“Immigration raids don’t make us safer. It makes people afraid to call for help. It keeps families from reporting crimes, working with trusted law enforcement, and seeking support,” Frey said in the video. “That’s not safety. That’s fear. ”

Council Member Robin Wonsley (Ward 2) said in an email statement that many “still recall the trauma” of Walz’s deployment of the National Guard in 2020 due to riots following the murder of George Floyd.

“Seeing troops in our streets again would reopen deep wounds, but Minneapolis’s working-class communities have always cared for one another in the face of state violence,” Wonsley said in the statement. “Immigrants are our friends, neighbors, and coworkers—and we will organize to protect them and all who are vulnerable.”

Mayor candidate and Sen. Omar Fateh (DFL-Minneapolis) said in an email statement that Noem was here to encourage ICE agents’ operations and that the White House “has its sights set on Minneapolis.” He added that this is because the city stands by people’s rights and democracy.

“If Trump tries to send troops here, and re-traumatizes our residents who lived through 2020, they’re going to have to go through us first,” Fateh said in the statement.",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-6.38.15-PM.png,N,,2025-10-25 16:57:16.618081

Lawsuits challenging the administration’s sweeps in Los Angeles and elsewhere are making their way through the courts.
But after an emergency appeal by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court reversed the judge in Los Angeles.
Before the Vasquez Perdomo decision, the court’s most influential ruling on immigration stops involved an American named Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.
“So it’s not surprising that for years, you’ve heard the Latino community complaining, not unreasonably, that immigration stops are based on race.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Again and again in Chicago and elsewhere in recent weeks, masked federal agents have accosted people who appear to be Latino and have confronted them with questions about their immigration status.

Targeting people for immigration enforcement based on race or ethnicity alone was forbidden by the U.S. Supreme Court in a unanimous decision 50 years ago. After all, it’s impossible to determine the immigration statuses of people simply by looking at them. So for decades, agents seeking to question people about their citizenship were supposed to rely on more than just appearance.

But as President Donald Trump has intensified his mass deportation campaign, roving patrols that have targeted predominantly Latino communities have become a key part of the administration’s playbook. And whether the tactics are legal appears to be an open question, one likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.

Lawsuits challenging the administration’s sweeps in Los Angeles and elsewhere are making their way through the courts. The outcomes could redefine the limits on the discretion officers have to stop, question and detain people over their immigration statuses and how much race and ethnicity can play into those decisions.

“We are in nebulous land,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is representing plaintiffs in Chicago. “We have never seen this type of enforcement on the streets ever.”

Last month, in an emergency ruling in the Los Angeles suit, the Supreme Court said federal agents there could question people about their immigration statuses based solely on factors such as race or ethnicity or another spoken language or accented English.

The decision isn’t final, as it overturned the temporary prohibition imposed by a federal judge on officers while she hears arguments on the case. But like many of the justices’ emergency decisions since the start of the new administration, the ruling appeared to signal substantial deference to the executive branch under Trump and the possibility that the court would ultimately side with him should it eventually issue an opinion on the case.

It is one of four legal challenges nationwide aiming to curb the warrantless arrests and traffic stops that have become a defining element of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

But even as the lawyers mounting the challenges are hoping to affirm constitutional limits on such immigration stops and apprehensions, experts warn that the lawsuits could end up further emboldening officers to use race or ethnicity in immigration enforcement.

Thomas Coffin was part of the government legal team in the case that led to the 1975 Supreme Court ruling that race could not be the sole factor in immigration stops. Although he and his colleagues lost the case, Coffin, now 80, said the decision and others had established crucial rights to privacy. But whether they govern the federal agents conducting sweeps on America’s streets today is, he said, “the $64,000 question.”

During the mass deportation campaign, Latinos have been stopped while driving gardening and landscaping trucks. They have been questioned and detained at bus stops and street corners where laborers gather to wait for work. They have been rounded up at farms, car washes and construction sites.

José Escobar Molina, 47, who had a temporary form of legal status for immigrants from El Salvador, said he was walking up to his work truck outside his apartment building in Washington, D.C., in August when he was confronted by agents, according to the lawsuit filed in Washington. Without asking for his name, identification or immigration status, the agents handcuffed him and drove him to a holding facility in Virginia, where he was forced to spend the night, he said in a declaration filed in court. When he was released a day later, an ICE agent apologized to him three times for the ordeal, Escobar Molina said.

In Chicago, where ICE tactics have escalated in recent weeks, lawyers say they have identified dozens of arrests that have violated a 2022 consent decree that covered six Midwestern states. The order — stemming from a 2018 class-action lawsuit that immigrant and civil rights groups filed against the first Trump administration on behalf of five immigrants — restricted federal immigration agents from apprehending and holding people without a warrant.

In court filings, government lawyers have asserted that federal agents are trained in the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures,” and that they should not be hobbled in their efforts to target immigrants lacking legal status.

Civil and immigrant rights groups have said the dragnets in different cities have violated the Constitution: Federal agents routinely approach people with brown skin or whom they perceive to be Latinos or immigrants. The agents ask who the people are and where they are from. If people refuse to answer or attempt to leave, they are held or handcuffed and sometimes subdued.

In the Los Angeles case, the lead plaintiff is a man named Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, one of several day laborers arrested at bus stops over the summer. Lawyers for the laborers say that federal agents are stopping Latino workers en masse without having reasonable suspicion or being able to articulate a legal basis for believing that the people being questioned are in the country illegally.

The legal challenges in Chicago and Washington, D.C., say federal officers are detaining and arresting people without meeting an even higher legal standard of having “probable cause” to suspect that a person is in the country illegally.

A fourth class-action case challenging both stops and arrests was filed in Mobile, Alabama, on behalf of Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a Latino construction worker and U.S. citizen born in Florida who was held by immigration officials on two occasions this year.

The judge in the Los Angeles case issued an injunction prohibiting federal agents in that part of California from conducting stops based on perceived race or ethnicity, or other factors, such as spoken Spanish or accented English.

But after an emergency appeal by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court reversed the judge in Los Angeles. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the injunction would “substantially hamper” efforts to enforce immigration laws in the Los Angeles area. He wrote that agents needed to be able to rely on their training and experience in “determining whether reasonable suspicion exists.”

In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the court’s decision eroded freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she said.

Before the Vasquez Perdomo decision, the court’s most influential ruling on immigration stops involved an American named Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.

On an evening in March 1973, Border Patrol agents who were staked out on an interstate highway between San Diego and Los Angeles stopped Brignoni-Ponce’s car because its occupants appeared to the agents to be of Mexican descent.

Upon discovering that two passengers did not have legal status, the federal agents arrested everyone and charged Brignoni-Ponce, a Marine Corps veteran and U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican ancestry, with knowingly transporting immigrants lacking legal status. But in a ruling two years later, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision throwing out the conviction, finding that officers could rely on “Mexican appearance” as a factor — but not the sole factor — in deciding to stop and question people about their citizenship.

To some critics of racial profiling, the decision seemed like a victory. But the ruling came to be seen by some experts as enabling racial profiling by allowing “Mexican appearance” to be a factor at all.

“Since race can be one factor, in the exercise of discretion, it can become the dominant factor in an immigration stop,” said Kevin R. Johnson, the former dean of the School of Law at the University of California, Davis. “So it’s not surprising that for years, you’ve heard the Latino community complaining, not unreasonably, that immigration stops are based on race.”

The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings.

In Torres v. Rubio, No. 24-40685 (5th Cir. Oct. 21, 2025) (unpublished), the Fifth Circuit affirmed a bench-trial judgment denying a declaratory judgment of birthright citizenship under 8 U.S.C. § 1503(a). The case arose after the State Department refused to issue a passport to Juan Manuel Torres, concluding he had not demonstrated U.S. birth by a preponderance of the evidence. At the heart of the dispute were conflicting records—a Texas birth certificate signed by a midwife later convicted for fraudulent registrations and multiple Mexican records (civil birth, baptismal, vaccination) listing Matamoros, Mexico as the place of birth—as well as a 1995 sworn statement by Torres’s mother to immigration officials that her son was born in Mexico and that a midwife had been paid to obtain a Texas birth certificate.

On appeal, Torres challenged the district court’s weighing of the evidence, including the evidentiary value of the Texas birth certificate, the credibility of the midwife’s testimony, and the district court’s reliance on his mother’s 1995 confession. The Fifth Circuit, applying clear-error review to the bench-trial findings, rejected each challenge. Most notably, the court clarified that district courts adjudicating § 1503(a) actions conduct a de novo determination of citizenship status and are not bound by the State Department’s passport regulations distinguishing “primary” versus “secondary” evidence. The court also reiterated that there is no per se legal rule that a first-recorded birth record is more credible than a later one, and it emphasized the appellate deference owed to trial-level credibility determinations.

Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment after a two-day bench trial that Torres failed to prove U.S. birth by a preponderance of the evidence. Three holdings drive the affirmance:

Section 1503(a) actions are independent, de novo judicial proceedings. District courts are not bound by State Department passport regulations (such as 22 C.F.R. § 51.42’s “primary evidence” framework) and may consider any competent evidence relevant to place of birth. Even within the regulatory framework, 22 C.F.R. § 51.45 empowers the Department to require additional evidence beyond a birth certificate.

There is no legal presumption that an earlier-filed birth certificate necessarily outweighs a later-filed record; factfinders may evaluate all the circumstances. The district court did not err in considering the Mexico birth certificate and other records notwithstanding the prior Texas registration.

Credibility determinations—here, crediting the midwife’s testimony and the mother’s 1995 written statement over trial testimony—are entitled to heightened deference on appeal. The district court’s account was plausible in light of the entire record, so there was no clear error.

Factual and Procedural Background

Torres applied for a U.S. passport in 2017, submitting a Texas birth certificate purportedly issued for his birth in San Benito, Texas on March 29, 1994. The Department requested additional evidence; Torres provided a Mexican civil birth certificate and baptismal certificate listing Matamoros, Mexico as his birthplace. The Department denied the passport in 2021.

In a § 1503(a) suit, Torres called his parents and the midwife, Elisa Meade, at a 2024 bench trial. His parents described a spontaneous encounter at a bus station leading to an emergency home birth in San Benito attended by a midwife who then delivered a Texas birth certificate days later. The mother’s 1995 interaction with immigration officials produced a written statement (which she signed) admitting a Matamoros birth and a midwife payment; she later claimed coercion. Meade testified she never delivered a baby alone, did not conduct emergency pick-ups, had a 1996 conviction for false Texas birth registrations, and signed a 1997 affidavit that she filed a false birth certificate for Torres.

The documentary record included the Texas birth certificate (favorable to U.S. birth) and the Mexican birth certificate, baptismal certificate, and vaccination records (all listing Matamoros). The district court found the parents’ narrative “difficult to accept,” concluded Meade’s affidavit stripped the Texas certificate of probative weight, credited the 1995 statement, and held that Torres did not carry his burden of proof. Torres appealed.

Detailed Analysis

Precedents and Authorities Cited

Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985): Establishes robust deference to trial court credibility determinations and factual findings under the clear-error standard. The Fifth Circuit quoted Anderson’s core rule that appellate courts may not reweigh evidence if the trial court’s account is plausible.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6): Findings of fact from bench trials “must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,” with due regard for the trial court’s opportunity to assess witness credibility.

Kona Tech. Corp. v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., 225 F.3d 595 (5th Cir. 2000): Bench-trial standard of review—clear error for fact-finding, de novo for legal issues.

Guzman v. Hacienda Records & Recording Studio, Inc., 808 F.3d 1031 (5th Cir. 2015): Emphasizes the “great deference” owed to district court factual findings.

Johnson v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 95 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 1996): Clarifies when challenges to weight-of-evidence are reviewed for clear error rather than as legal errors; applied here to treat Torres’s evidentiary-weight arguments as clear-error challenges.

De Vargas v. Brownell, 251 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1958): Places the burden on the § 1503(a) plaintiff to prove citizenship by a preponderance of the evidence; also notes the caution with which “interested” witness testimony should be received.

Richards v. Secretary of State, 752 F.2d 1413 (9th Cir. 1985), and Mathin v. Kerry, 782 F.3d 804 (7th Cir. 2015): Persuasive authorities confirming that § 1503(a) actions are independent de novo determinations, not administrative-review proceedings bound by agency regulations.

Martinez v. Secretary of State, 652 F. App’x 758 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam): Rejects the notion that a state birth certificate creates a presumption of citizenship in § 1503 litigation; cited here to support considering additional “secondary” evidence even where a birth certificate exists.

Salinas Moya v. Limon, 793 F. App’x 296 (5th Cir. 2019) (per curiam): Holds there is no rule that older evidence is automatically more credible than newer evidence; supports the district court’s decision to weigh a later Mexican birth certificate alongside an earlier Texas record.

Garcia v. Kerry, 557 F. App’x 304 (5th Cir. 2014) (per curiam): Affirms discrediting a mother’s testimony resting on “unlikely coincidences,” paralleling the trial court’s skepticism of the parents’ narrative here.

22 C.F.R. § 51.42 and § 51.45: State Department passport regulations distinguishing “primary” and “secondary” evidence (birth certificates vs. other records) and authorizing the Department to require any additional evidence deemed necessary. The panel explained these regulations do not bind district courts in § 1503(a) cases; even so, § 51.45 undermines any argument that submission of a birth certificate precludes review of other evidence.

Legal Reasoning

The panel organized its analysis around three appellate challenges—each resolved under clear-error review because they attacked the trial court’s weighing of evidence and credibility rather than asserting a legal misinterpretation.

1) The Texas Birth Certificate and the “Primary vs. Secondary” Evidence Argument

Torres argued the district court gave insufficient weight to his Texas birth certificate because, under passport regulations, it is “primary evidence” and should eclipse “secondary” evidence like baptismal or school records. The Fifth Circuit rejected this for two reasons:

De novo adjudication: A § 1503(a) action is an independent judicial determination of nationality status, not an administrative-review proceeding. As such, State Department evidentiary regulations do not constrain the kinds of evidence that a district court may consider. The court relied on Richards (9th Cir.) and Mathin (7th Cir.).

Even within the regulatory framework, § 51.45 expressly allows the Department to demand additional evidence beyond a birth certificate; thus, the idea that “secondary” evidence is off-limits when a birth certificate exists is incorrect. The Eleventh Circuit’s Martinez supports this reading and rejects a presumption of citizenship from a state birth certificate in § 1503 litigation.

The Fifth Circuit also emphasized that there is no legal rule privileging the first-recorded birth certificate over a later-recorded foreign certificate; citing Salinas Moya, the court reiterated that “older” is not automatically “more credible.” The district court thus acted within its discretion to consider and weigh the Mexican records—especially given independent reasons to discount the Texas certificate (the midwife’s 1996 conviction and 1997 affidavit admitting a false registration for Torres).

2) The Midwife’s Testimony and Credibility

Torres challenged the weight accorded to the midwife’s testimony because of her age, a passing reference to occasional forgetfulness, and minor inconsistencies (e.g., costs she associated with registering births). The Fifth Circuit emphasized the heightened deference due to trial-level credibility assessments (Anderson; Rule 52(a)(6)). The claimed inconsistencies did not undermine the trial court’s credibility finding, particularly in light of the midwife’s conviction and her 1997 affidavit acknowledging a false birth certificate for Torres—documentary anchors that significantly eroded the probative value of the Texas record. The panel found no clear error in crediting her testimony and affidavit.

3) The Mother’s 1995 Statement and Claims of Coercion

Torres argued that his mother’s 1995 statement to immigration officials (admitting a Mexican birth and a payment to a midwife) was involuntary and should not have been credited. The Fifth Circuit again deferred to the district court’s factual findings and credibility calls:

The trial court reasonably found the parents’ account “difficult to accept” because it turned on a string of unlikely coincidences and was contradicted by documentary records listing Matamoros as the birthplace.

The court found no persuasive reason why an immigration officer would fabricate the 1995 statement, especially since the mother signed a document containing the admission.

The mother was an “interested” witness in her son’s § 1503(a) case, justifying caution in assessing her trial testimony (De Vargas).

On this record, the district court’s decision to credit the 1995 statement over trial testimony alleging coercion was plausible and therefore insulated from reversal under clear-error review.

Impact and Implications

Although unpublished and thus non-precedential under Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, Torres v. Rubio carries significant persuasive weight and offers practical guidance for § 1503(a) litigation in the Fifth Circuit and beyond.

De novo means de novo: District courts are not bound by the State Department’s passport evidentiary taxonomy. Litigants cannot rely on 22 C.F.R. § 51.42 to prevent consideration of other records, nor to create a presumption from a state birth certificate. Courts may weigh all probative evidence.

No automatic priority to first-filed birth records: The panel reaffirms that chronology alone does not decide authenticity or credibility. Later-filed foreign records can be persuasive, particularly where corroborated by related records (baptismal, vaccination) and where independent factors undermine the earlier domestic record.

Trial credibility calls are decisive: Because § 1503 cases are fact-intensive and often turn on witness credibility and documentary nuance, the clear-error standard provides a significant buffer on appeal. Parties must build the best possible record at trial; appellate courts will not reweigh evidence if the trial court’s narrative is plausible.

Midwife-registered Texas certificates require corroboration: Where there is evidence of registration irregularities or fraud (e.g., prior convictions, sworn affidavits), courts may substantially discount a Texas birth certificate without erring. Litigants should marshal independent corroboration (e.g., contemporaneous medical, hospital, or third-party records; non-interested witnesses).

Practice Pointers for § 1503(a) Litigants

Do not assume a state birth certificate will end the inquiry. Be prepared to present corroborating evidence consistent with U.S. birth (medical, school, and third-party affidavits; contemporaneous photographs or hospital discharge records; border-crossing logs; tax or benefit records linked to newborn care).

Anticipate and address foreign records. If contrary foreign birth or church records exist, proactively explain or rebut them with context and documentation.

Prepare for credibility challenges. Interested witnesses (parents, close family) face heightened scrutiny. Where possible, include disinterested witnesses and contemporaneous documents.

If alleging coercion of prior statements, develop a robust factual record: details of the setting, witnesses, translation issues, contemporaneous objections, and any documentation to support the coercion claim. Absent such support, trial courts may credit signed statements over later recantations.

Complex Concepts Simplified

8 U.S.C. § 1503(a): A federal statute allowing a person in the U.S. who has been denied a right or privilege as a U.S. national (e.g., a passport) to file a civil suit for a declaratory judgment that he or she is a U.S. national. The district court decides citizenship status anew (de novo).

Preponderance of the Evidence: The plaintiff’s burden in § 1503(a) suits. It means “more likely than not”—a greater than 50% likelihood that the claim (U.S. birth) is true.

De Novo Determination vs. Agency Review: In § 1503, the court does not review the agency’s decision under administrative law standards; it independently determines the fact of citizenship. Agency regulations do not bind the court’s evidentiary analysis.

Clear Error Standard (Appellate Review): On appeal from a bench trial, factual findings stand unless the appellate court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Credibility findings get “even greater” deference.

“Primary” vs. “Secondary” Evidence (Passport Regulations): For passport processing, the State Department treats a birth certificate as primary evidence, and other records (church, school, medical) as secondary. In § 1503 litigation, courts are not bound by this scheme and may consider all probative evidence.

Interested Witness: A witness with a personal stake in the case’s outcome (e.g., a parent in a child’s citizenship suit). Courts scrutinize such testimony carefully when it conflicts with other evidence.

Affidavit: A sworn written statement. In this case, the midwife’s 1997 affidavit admitting she filed a false birth certificate for Torres was central to the court’s evaluation of the Texas record.

What the Court Did Not Decide

No categorical rule on the weight of any given document: The court did not adopt a universal hierarchy among birth records; it endorsed case-by-case weighing.

No evidentiary exclusion of “secondary” materials: The court did not limit the admissibility of secondary evidence when a birth certificate exists.

No holding that a mother’s post hoc coercion claim can never succeed: The ruling is record-specific; stronger evidence of coercion might change the outcome in a different case.

Conclusion

Torres v. Rubio underscores three controlling themes in § 1503(a) litigation: the district court’s de novo authority unconstrained by passport regulations; the absence of any formal presumption favoring earlier-recorded birth certificates; and the powerful deference appellate courts accord to trial-level credibility assessments. The decision aligns the Fifth Circuit’s approach with sister-circuit authority (Richards, Mathin, Martinez) and reinforces that § 1503 cases are intensely fact-driven. For litigants, the message is clear: success turns on building a comprehensive, coherent evidentiary record at trial—one that can withstand rigorous credibility scrutiny and that does not rely on a single documentary keystone when countervailing records and sworn admissions exist.

He would have turned 32 on 5 January, the day of their 10th wedding anniversary, Gauffeny said as she stood sorrowfully in front of García-Hernández’s grave.

After the shooting and the death of García-Hernández, Gauffeny said she received hateful messages from strangers on social media.
There is no headstone on García-Hernández’s grave yet because she cannot afford it.","A few hours before the Texas sun set, Stephany Gauffeny held her newborn son close to her chest as she started walking in a cemetery. The grave she stopped at had no headstone, but Gauffeny, 32, had written her husband’s name on a red ribbon.

She married Miguel García-Hernández in 2016, nearly 10 years before he was shot at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas in late September.

“I am trying to cope because that’s what I am supposed to do, but what hurts me the most is to hear my kids ask where daddy is,” said Gauffeny, speaking to the Guardian in her first interview since his death.

“My eight-year-old daughter with autism waited for him until the last minute. They would talk over the phone while he was detained, but one day before the funeral, I had to tell her that daddy was in heaven and that he would be watching her and that she wouldn’t see him.”

García-Hernández ended up in ICE custody early on 24 September after a short time in jail for a DUI. That same morning, while he was shackled inside a government van, a gunman opened fire outside the ICE field office in Dallas where he was awaiting intake.

Federal authorities have said the attacker was targeting ICE officials, but only detainees were hurt, including García-Hernández, 31, who was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

“I was coming back from a doctor’s appointment for my pregnancy and I was so excited to tell him about our son, but I got a call saying that my husband was in the hospital,” said Gauffeny, switching between English and Spanish intermittently.

“I walked into the [hospital] room and I just started crying. His arms were restrained to the bed and he had handcuffs on his feet.”

García-Hernández died on 29 September from his gunshot wounds. His third child with Gauffeny was born three days later. He would have turned 32 on 5 January, the day of their 10th wedding anniversary, Gauffeny said as she stood sorrowfully in front of García-Hernández’s grave.

She believes the rising political violence and anti-immigration agenda in the US played a part in her husband’s violent death.

The couple had been focusing hard on the new home they bought a few months ago in Arlington, on the outskirts of Dallas. There, they lived with their children, as well as two girls from Gauffeny’s previous relationship whom García-Hernández had helped raise.

“He talked about little projects like turning the garage into a room, painting some parts of the house, getting a new fence and doing it all by himself,” said Gauffeny, her voice cracking.

“It hurts to look around now, you know? Who is going to do it?”

García-Hernández was born in San Luis Potosí, a central state in Mexico, and crossed the US border without papers when he was 14. Though the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program has benefited hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants with similar cases since 2012, he arrived just too early to qualify.

García-Hernández lived in the Dallas area for nearly two decades, most recently making a living painting and remodeling homes. Gauffeny said he had applied for a Biden administration initiative, dubbed Keeping Families Together, that was designed to allow the undocumented spouses of US citizens to get legal status. However, a federal judge in Texas blocked the policy just a few months after it started.

Martina Alvarado, a lawyer who tried to help García-Hernández fix his immigration status, said he was awaiting a waiver that, if granted, would effectively erase his illegal entry into the US and allow him to get a green card based on his marriage to an American citizen.

Gauffeny said her husband was planning to open his own painting company as soon as his immigration case was resolved, and he had been saving money for the equipment.

Since Donald Trump took office for a second time, his administration has aggressively expanded immigration raids across the country, granting deportation agents a broad mandate to target those in the country without proper documents, even if they’re not criminals. The crackdown has spurred massive protests and growing concerns over tactics by federal agents.

The contentious climate around immigration under the Trump administration can also be palpable far from the neighborhoods and the streets where federal agents roam. After the shooting and the death of García-Hernández, Gauffeny said she received hateful messages from strangers on social media.

“Some comments said they were happy that it happened because he shouldn’t have been here illegally,” said Gauffeny.

“He and I never hid the fact he entered illegally, you know, but what I keep saying is that he didn’t deserve that and we’re going to fight this.”

Eric Cedillo, a Dallas attorney who has been helping Gauffeny since the shooting, said they are contemplating filing a lawsuit, without specifying details at that time.

García-Hernández’s mother, Maria García, was deported to Mexico earlier this year and was initially unable to see her son when he was hospitalized. But she was allowed into the US after the Mexican government intervened. In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said “an extraordinary humanitarian parole was arranged for García-Hernández’s mother to travel to the US”.

The statement did not provide information on what, if any, economic assistance has or will be given to Gauffeny to cover expenses related to García-Hernández’s funeral.

At the funeral, a Mexican flag was laid next to his grave by the Brown Berets of North Texas, a community defense group that runs an “ICE Watch” in the area. When Stephany visited with newborn Miles Alexander last week, the flag was gone but some roses remained.

Gauffeny said that securing the burial site was possible thanks to money donated to a GoFundMe page created by her sister-in-law. There is no headstone on García-Hernández’s grave yet because she cannot afford it.

“My biggest concern now is to have a place to live in the future. Our mortgage is very expensive and we were already struggling when he was detained. I am scared for my kids,” Gauffeny said.

Before leaving the cemetery in Arlington, Gauffeny recalled that her husband had bought a Bible in Spanish while in the custody of Tarrant county for the DUI. Days after his death, his belongings came in the mail, including the Bible, which he had bookmarked.

She said: “It was on a page in Genesis. He wanted to read the Bible from the start to the end but couldn’t continue because he was killed.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cf1dd902bad9730e38e823fe866fd9a4b0a073c/0_0_2000_1600/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f444ae5e3d262195b5739d6445f14d4f",N,,2025-10-25 12:21:16.570414

ICE has been escalating their response to protesters every time we’ve gone.
The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters.","The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview located outside of Chicago has become a focal point for protesters who want to resist the agency. A viral photo of an ICE agent at the site pepper spraying a pastor in the face has come to exemplify the aggressive and violent tactics federal officers are using to corral the demonstrations.

The Rev. Quincy Worthington was there the night his friend, the Rev. David Black, was shot in the back of the head with a pepper bullet and pepper-sprayed in the face, and has returned every weekend since. He’s seen ICE agents hit protesters with batons, shoot pepper balls and rubber bullets, and deploy flash-bangs into the crowd. Worthington says his faith is what keeps him going back after some of the scariest nights of his life.

Below is a conversation between Worthington and Today, Explained host Noel King. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did this start for you?

At the beginning of September, I went to a Faith Over Fear rally and press conference in Daley Plaza [in downtown Chicago] that was about Operation Midway Blitz ramping up and about a faithful response to that. David was there and he spoke, and through conversation of asking him what was going on and what he was doing, he told me about Broadview and the things that were going on there. And he said that it would be really great to have more clergy presence there, because we provide a sense of calm and can help deescalate things sometimes if it needs to be deescalated. I told him I would be happy to join him at those and went that Friday.

That night when the picture was taken, he and I had actually just arrived there together. And I was checking in with people at a supply table, finding out who the medics are, because [the ICE agents had] been releasing chemical munitions on us before. One of the things I’ve been trying to help do is get protesters safely away from the chemical munitions and to get the medical treatment if they need it; helping flush out eyes. While I was connecting there, David went up front as he usually does to pray, to plead to the humanity of the officers. He had finished doing that and was turning around to walk away, and the agent on the roof shot him in the top of the head with a pepper ball.

Were you surprised that this happened?

(Sigh) I think by that time, no. I mean, I guess you’re surprised every time it happens. I wasn’t shocked. ICE has been escalating their response to protesters every time we’ve gone. So I think I was a little taken back in the moment that it was just a random pot shot that they took at him, but it wasn’t entirely surprising that that’s how they responded.

When did things start to escalate between the protesters outside of Broadview and law enforcement? And what did it look like when it did?

“I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.”

When I started going in September, what we would notice is an escalation both throughout the day and then every week that we would go. It first started early in the day, when vehicles would come in and out, that they were trying to keep the road clear and protesters away. At least I assume that’s what they were trying to do. Then it seemed like they would randomly come out and just attack us.

And so the pattern would be: You would see one to three agents appear on the roof. You would see a drone go up in the air, and that’s when you knew something was coming. And then as the gate would open, the men from the roof would shoot down pepper balls onto the protesters and sometimes rubber bullets. The gates would open. Anywhere from 20 to 50 agents, depending on how large the crowd would be, would then rush into the crowd, essentially throwing tear gas at us, shooting us with pepper balls. I saw canisters of pepper spray that they would just douse the crowd in. They would shove people to the ground; they would sometimes grab somebody and detain them.

Do you find this frightening?

I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.

What you’ve just described went down in September. It’s late October. Is this still happening at Broadview?

Right now, there’s a temporary restraining order preventing ICE from using chemical munitions. So we haven’t seen that exactly at Broadview. We’ve seen it at other places in the city where ICE is conducting operations. But since October, Illinois State Police has come in. They have threatened to use chemical munitions, but have never released them that I’ve seen. Instead, they carry batons and use physical force.

The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters. They’re in some cases, and I quote, “violent rioters.” What have you seen?

I have not seen anything to lead me to believe that these are violent rioters. I’ve never seen protesters acting any way but peacefully. They might yell things that I think are inappropriate, that I certainly wouldn’t yell at somebody, but that’s totally within their First Amendment rights. So I challenge that narrative. I have not seen anything that would look anything remotely like a riot.

After what you’ve seen over the past couple of weeks — agents of the federal government, in your telling, attacking peaceful protesters — has this changed your feelings about law enforcement?

I think this has changed my feelings about just about everything. I think it’s made me seriously question my understanding of law enforcement and why they’re there, the way the US government operates. And I think on a personal level, it’s caused me to struggle with and think deeper about my own faith and about what it means to be a person of faith — and what it means to be a citizen of this country.

As a minister and a professionally trained theologian, we often tend to think of these things in abstract ideas. There’s this idea of essentially picking up your cross and following Christ, or, are you willing to die for your faith? And those were kind of abstract ideas for me. I think in a very real sense, I’ve been forced to confront the very real possibility that by living out my Christian convictions, that I’m putting myself in serious jeopardy.

For me, the call to follow Christ has to reign supreme in my life. And what I witness in the life and teachings of Jesus is a man who stands up to unfair oppression. He speaks boldly and prophetically about standing up for the least of these. About trying to give voice to those who feel voiceless and standing with people who can’t stand by themselves, and giving hope to the hopeless. More important than that, I think the linchpin, the reasoning behind that is that Jesus firmly believed that every person is a precious child of God, and that we’re all created in the image of God. And that’s something that’s sacred and needs to be protected. And so when I see things that are blatant human rights violations and the denial of basic human rights to our brothers and sisters...

Abrego Garcia was returned to US soil months later, only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges, a separate case from the Maryland proceedings.","The case of Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March and then sent back to the United States in June, has become a lightning rod for those opposed to Trump's efforts to carry out mass deportations across the United States.

The Trump administration alleges he is a violent MS-13 gang member involved in smuggling other undocumented migrants.

His lawyers have filed a suit contesting his deportation, and a federal judge in August blocked an attempt to send Abrego Garcia, who is married to a US citizen and denies all wrongdoing, to Uganda.

In Friday's filing, government attorneys say they have identified the west African country of Liberia as a site for ""removal,"" as it was not on a list of countries that Abrego Garcia's attorneys had rejected out of hand.

""Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,"" attorneys said in the filing in a US federal court in Maryland.

The government noted that Liberia is an English-speaking country and is ""committed to the humane treatment of refugees.""

It said it could complete the deportation ""as soon as October 31.""

Abrego Garcia's lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE is seeking to deport his client ""to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland.""

""Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement on his law firm's website.

Abrego Garcia had been living in the United States under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March as part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants.

But Justice Department lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran had been wrongly deported due to an ""administrative error.""

Abrego Garcia was returned to US soil months later, only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges, a separate case from the Maryland proceedings.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president's toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

Residents say law enforcement arrived sometime around 6 a.m.

Video posted to social media and shared with KATU show officers telling residents they were serving a search warrant in the area, and that they were conducting an investigation.

""They [officers] said supposedly because there was a whole bunch of guns and drugs, and that's why they were coming to the apartment,"" Carrington Square resident Priscilla Mazorra said.

In a post on social media, state Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, confirmed Rockwood Preparatory School closed because of the operation.

“Witnesses reported over 10 vehicles arriving and targeting two individuals,” Ruiz said.

According to Mazzora, officers used some sort of explosive device to blow at least two doors off the hinges, then raided at least one of those apartments.

Mazzora told KATU she saw four people detained by federal officers, including three from one household, but that number has not been confirmed.

One Gresham man who did not want to be named, called the extent of the operation unwarranted.

""If they're doing an investigative type of warrant like they stated, they don't need 30 to 40 officers. It's a waste of resources,"" he said. ""It's a waste of taxpayer dollars to be having that many amount of agents for a couple of apartments that they were going through and the vehicles that they were going through.""

Gresham Police Chief Travis Gullberg and Gresham City Manager Eric Schmidt co-released a statement on the operation, writing in part, ""The City of Gresham became aware that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted operations within our community, which appeared to include the use of aircraft.""

The statement went on to read, ""In accordance with Oregon law, the Gresham Police Department does not coordinate with or participate in immigration enforcement with ICE. These activities may occur independently within our city, but our department is not involved in those enforcement efforts.""

Ruiz warned Gresham residents that they should expect to see more ICE operations in the coming weeks.

“These are not normal times,” Ruiz said. “When a school in the heart of Rockwood has to cancel classes without notice and a community is left in crisis, it’s clear that these tactics are meant to create fear in one of our most diverse and vulnerable neighborhoods.”

""It's really sad you know,"" Mazorra said. ""It's very concerning 'cause now families have to really, like, watch their back, and having to live like that in fear is just not something that any wants to experience.""

KATU reached out to Ruiz as well as Rockwood Preparatory School for further comment and is awaiting responses.

Morning Reads

Trump backs away from sending federal troops to San Francisco after pleas from tech leaders (Alexandra Marquez and David Ingram, NBC News) — President Donald Trump on Thursday said that “he is calling off plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco after speaking to the city’s mayor and following backlash from the tech industry,” according to NBC News. His decision keeps San Francisco clear, at least for now, of ongoing legal battles over Trump’s authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard to cities that oppose the deployment. “The Trump administration and California’s government are already engaged in a legal battle over the president’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell protests against immigration enforcement raids in the city and surrounding areas. … Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Portland, Chicago and Washington this year,” and the question of whether the Chicago deployment can proceed is in front of the Supreme Court.

Cities, nonprofits challenge Trump grant freeze at Fourth Circuit (Steve Garrison, Courthouse News Service) — Two months after the Supreme Court held in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association that disputes over the Trump administration’s effort to freeze certain federal grants likely belong in the Court of Federal Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is weighing whether it was improper for a U.S. district judge in South Carolina to order the administration to fund “more than 30 environmental or agricultural grants awarded to various nonprofits and cities,” according to Courthouse News Service. The government contends, citing the NIH decision, that the case on the environmental and agricultural grants needs to move to the Court of Federal Claims, while the grantees “argued Thursday that the constitutional claims raised in the suit could not be properly decided by the 16-judge court that specializes in handling government contract disputes.”

‘That would be neat’: American businesses eye $1 trillion in tariff refunds—and a long fight ahead—depending on the Supreme Court (Sasha Rogelberg, Fortune)(Paywall) — If the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings striking down tariffs, the federal government may need to refund up to $1 trillion in tariff revenue to American companies, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, finance experts told Fortune that some small businesses may forego the money in order to avoid what could turn out to be a complicated refund process. “The general feeling is, if you have the resources, and you have the capability, the juice is worth the squeeze,” said David Warrick, executive vice president of supply-chain risk management firm Overhaul. “If you are a smaller business or a smaller importer, you’ve already spent time baking in the cost of tariffs and the associated risks to your supply chain, then you’ve got to weigh up that cost-benefit.”

Harvard sees drop in Black, Hispanic student admissions, rise in Asian Americans (Lexi Lonas Cochran, The Hill) — Harvard College’s latest admissions data shows that Black students comprise 11.5% of the school’s class of 2029, down from 14% in the class of 2028, according to The Hill. “For Black students, the slide has been consistent since the 2023 Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in higher education. Before the decision, Black students made up 18 percent of Harvard’s student population.” Hispanic student admissions are also down (from 16% to 11%), but the share of Asian American students is up by four percentage points. Harvard did not provide admissions data for white students.

Fighting Trump and defending Tesla, lawyer Paul Clement is everywhere now (Mike Scarcella, Sara Merken, and David Thomas, Reuters) — Former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, and he’s showing no signs of slowing down, according to Reuters. He’s set to argue two cases in front of the court in December, and he’s working on several other high-profile disputes. “He’s on the team representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a major fight at the Supreme Court over Trump’s effort to oust her, and defending U.S. judges in Maryland in an unusual lawsuit brought against them by the U.S. Justice Department over immigration. … For [Elon] Musk, Clement is part of a team defending Tesla in federal court in wrongful death litigation, and representing X Corp in a battle with watchdog Media Matters.”

Several cases on the interim docket are fully briefed and awaiting the court’s response, including the Trump administration’s request to be allowed to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Illinois. For more information on the current state of the interim docket, check out Kelsey’s story in the On Site section below.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is scheduled to speak at Springfield Symphony Hall in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Monday night, about her path to the Supreme Court.

A Closer Look: Capital Punishment

The Supreme Court on Thursday denied two requests for a stay of execution from Anthony Boyd, clearing the way for him to be put to death in Alabama hours later. Boyd became the 40th person executed in the United States this year, which has seen a surge of executions after a period of decline, as SCOTUSblog reported last month.

So far this year, the Supreme Court has considered more than 30 emergency stay applications for persons on death row, and it has not granted a single one. For those who are familiar with the court’s typical approach to capital litigation, this trend likely isn’t surprising. Such emergency applications are rarely viewed favorably by the justices.

Most of this year’s denials have come and gone without a noted dissent. Boyd’s case is one exception. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the denial, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Another exception is the case of Crawford v. Mississippi, which the court addressed last week. Charles Ray Crawford contended that his attorneys “conceded [his] guilt before the jury” after he expressly told them not to, and noted that the Supreme Court later held in a separate case that such an action by attorneys violates the Sixth Amendment. Crawford’s stay request was denied, but, as with Boyd, Sotomayor dissented, joined by Kagan and Jackson.

Death row inmates have fared better when their case makes it to the merits docket, at least in recent years. During the 2024-25 term, the justices ruled in favor of the inmate in three cases – Andrew v. White, Glossip v. Oklahoma, and Gutierrez v. Saenz – by either asking a lower court to reconsider their claims or ordering a new trial. In the term ahead, the court will again weigh in on the administration of the death penalty in Hamm v. Smith, a case about how courts, when presented with multiple IQ scores, should determine whether a capital defendant is so intellectually disabled that he may not be executed.

SCOTUS Quote

“From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.”

— Justice Harry Blackmun in Callins v. Collins

The Interim Docket Remains Active

The Supreme Court is done hearing argument for October, but that does not mean it’s done making major rulings. There are several applications awaiting action on the court’s interim docket, including the Trump administration’s request to be allowed to federalize and deploy the National Guard within Illinois and its attempt to change the current rules for sex markers on passports. Check out Kelsey’s story for a brief overview of the pending applications.

From Amy Howe

Court Turns Down Man’s Request to Die By Firing Squad

The Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon turned down a request from an Alabama inmate to block his execution. In an unsigned order, the justices denied Anthony Boyd’s plea to put his execution on hold and to decide whether executing him by nitrogen hypoxia would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the court’s decision to allow the execution to go forward. In a nine-page opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sotomayor wrote that “Boyd asks for the barest form of mercy: to die by firing squad, which would kill him in seconds, rather than by a torturous suffocation lasting up to four minutes. The Constitution would grant him that grace. My colleagues do not,” as Amy noted in her analysis.

With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.
It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.
The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits.
Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies.","This month is the 63rd anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis. In October 1962, Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev tried to intimidate the young first-term U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, by moving nuclear warheads and missiles into Cuba. Though the threat of nuclear war loomed, Kennedy rose to the challenge: Khrushchev blinked, and Russia removed the nuclear warheads from Cuba.

We are now witnessing another generational standoff between America’s bully-in-chief, President Donald Trump, and Zohran Mamdani, the likely next mayor of New York City, whom Trump has referred to as “Mamdani the commie.” In 1962, Khrushchev was 23 years older than Kennedy. The difference in age between Trump and Mamdani — 44 years — is about double.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats.

If Mamdani becomes mayor, Trump has vowed to withhold billions of dollars in federal funds from New York, take over New York “when we have to,” and arrest Mamdani if he defies federal immigration enforcement. This week, the president admitted Mamdani is likely to win, “but here’s the good news: He’s got to go through the White House.” The other object of Trump’s bullying is New York City voters, who effectively are being told that voting for Mamdani risks reprisals against their city.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats. To understand what is in store for New York, we need look no further than the illegal actions Trump has already perpetrated against colleges, universities, law firms and other cities and states. Trump may, for instance, direct federal agencies to conduct bogus investigations of New York City agencies for their use of federal funds. He may federalize the New York National Guard to patrol the City’s streets under the pretext of fighting crime. He may demand his Justice Department indict Mamdani on flimsy pretexts, such as not cooperating with his immigration policies.

So far, Trump has spared New York from the wrath he has inflicted on other major Democratic Party-controlled cities, including Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles. But that’s because current Mayor Eric Adams agreed to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policies, and in return the Justice Department moved to dismiss Adams’ federal charges for bribery and fraud. With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.

Mamdani has no illusions about Trump’s vindictiveness. So far, Mamdani has politically pushed back against Trump’s bullying with the united front of New York’s two top state officials — Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James (herself a target of the president). He has likely recognized that every target of Trump’s bullying that has stood up to the president has gained rather than lost political clout. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, for example, regained public support after directly confronting federal agents when Trump sent the National Guard into LA.

But more is now needed. It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower.

A major battleground in this fight will be the federal court in the Southern District of New York. Mamdani’s team should review what legal actions other cities and states have brought against the Trump administration in federal court and begin compiling the types of legal pleadings that are likely to be successful. A committee of advisers should oversee the drafting of ready-to-file court papers to use, as necessary, the day Mamdani becomes Mayor.

Fortunately for that committee, Trump has shown a penchant for not following the U.S. Constitution and statutory law. This has been his underlying weakness in his ongoing retribution campaigns against his perceived enemies. New York City must be prepared to seize on those missteps and follow the examples of Harvard University, Jenner & Block and other institutions that have successfully used Trump’s blatant violations of the law against him in court.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower. The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits. However, the Law Department currently has numerous vacancies for lawyers. As soon as Mamdani becomes mayor, he must fill those positions.

Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies. A well-thought-out strategic plan, similar to the one Kennedy orchestrated in response to Khrushchev, is the best path to defeating the bully.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-donald-trump-zohran-mamdani-zz-c8a8d4.jpg",N,,2025-10-25 04:56:32.976456

“Under the leadership of (Minneapolis) Mayor (Jacob) Frey, under the leadership of Gov. Walz, more violent crimes are being perpetuated in these communities because of their refusal to defend American citizens,” Noem said.

Noem said federal efforts in Minnesota have resulted in the removal of 4,300 individuals ""off of our streets."" Of those, 3,316 had criminal histories and 98 were part of foreign terrorist organizations, according to Noem.

Noem's appearance on Friday was met with a crowd of more than 300 protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. The DHS head spoke to the media from behind a table of items she said were seized by ICE, including rifles, cocaine and methamphetamine.

Protesters ahead of the news conference suspected that Noem’s visit would announce the deployment of new federal agents in Minnesota. When asked during the news conference, Noem said that it is “up to the president,” and she wouldn’t say if Minnesota specifically would be seeing an increase in federal officers, but that DHS is expecting an increase of roughly 10,000 new ICE officers across the country.

Noem said that she is looking at local partnerships with sheriffs as well as state agreements and cooperatives, “such as Gov. Walz has not been.”

“If (Walz) would sign agreements with us to have our backs out on operations, that he would help with the safety and security of our federal officers when they're out there protecting people and making sure that we're focused on getting the worst of the worst off our streets as soon as possible, that would be absolutely wonderful,” Noem said. “That would be fundamental, because I don't know how he sleeps at night.”

A spokesperson with Walz's office told Forum News Service on Friday evening that Noem's visit appeared to be ""more about pulling a political stunt than about solving a problem.""

""The governor wishes the Trump administration would stay focused on the real issues facing Americans: skyrocketing health care costs, a crisis for farmers, and the ongoing federal government shutdown,"" the spokesperson said.

The Prairie Correctional facility in Appleton has been eyed as a potential ICE detention facility, The Washington Post reported in August, citing internal ICE documents. Noem said that she couldn't speak to specific contracts but confirmed Friday that DHS is looking at Minnesota.

Noem also touted “Operation Twin Shield” conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Sept. 19 to 28.

USCIS said the operation was “the first of its kind” and was aimed at fraud detection and deterrence activities in which immigration officers discovered suspected fraud in 275 cases across Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Noem's visit came three weeks after the Justice Department sued Minnesota over its ""sanctuary policies."" Walz has rejected that Minnesota is a sanctuary state, while Twin Cities mayors stand behind their separation ordinances.

It also comes as federal law enforcement cracks down in Chicago, the most recent of U.S. cities to see a surge in federal law enforcement presence. Two million undocumented immigrants have been removed or have self-deported since Jan. 20 of this year, the Department of Homeland Security reported in September.

Outside of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a large crowd gathered Friday afternoon.

Amber Mathwig, a veteran with About Face: Veterans Against the War, said she heard about Noem’s visit Friday on social media and that she's worried there will be an announcement that Minnesota “is the next target.”

“My concern out of this is not only that there's going to be a increase in incredibly violent, you know, detainment, kidnappings by ICE, but that a national guard from another state is going to be, you know, asked to go occupy our city, and what can happen from there,” Mathwig said.

Becky Gee, a former South Dakota resident, also heard about Noem’s visit on social media. Standing outside next to a small crowd of Trump flags, she came to show support for her former governor.

“I'm just out today supporting not only the administration, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, just overall law and order,” Gee said. “We have to have immigrants, but we have to have immigrants coming the legal route.”

Minnesota was home to approximately 130,000 undocumented immigrants in 2023, according to a 2025 analysis from Pew Research Center — considerably smaller than estimates for states such as California, Texas and Florida, which stand in the millions.

Minnesota has more undocumented immigrants than all of its bordering states but other Midwest states such as Illinois and Michigan top Minnesota, at 550,000 and 200,000 respectively, according to the Pew estimates.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/0978ff2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2Fa7%2F3fc7afb8402fbb76aedf8af17ab2%2Fdsc-1371-1.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 02:16:52.587575

Speaking at a late afternoon news conference, she blamed Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for an increase of violent crime. She also highlighted federal funding that has been recently approved to hire more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

“We have thousands more in the next week or two that will be deployed into field offices as well, and this office will be the beneficiary as well,” she said.

Noem’s appearance drew hundreds of protesters who held a news conference of their own and a rally outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which houses the Fort Snelling Immigration Court.

It comes on the heels of Operation Twin Shield, a “targeted surge” in enforcement by immigration officials and the FBI in the Twin Cities metro area in September that officials said uncovered 275 cases of suspected immigration fraud.

At the news conference Friday, Noem spoke behind a table piled high with confiscated assault weapons. She was joined by Samuel Westbay, St. Paul special agent in charge from Homeland Security Investigations and HSI Special Agent Tonya Price, among others.

Since January, Noem said federal agents have arrested more than 4,300 people in Minnesota for immigration violations. She highlighted four cases at the news conference of men arrested for crimes including human trafficking, homicide and sexual assault.

Major cities in Minnesota do not comply with ICE’s request to hold detainees, Noem said, allowing “dangerous criminals” to be released.

Last month, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota, city of Minneapolis, city of St. Paul and other state officials over policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. The case is still pending.

Both cities are involved in lawsuits to block Trump’s order earlier this year to cut federal funding grants that support city services. Some of the threatened services include housing support, transportation and emergency management.

Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter released statements in response to Noem’s visit on Friday, reassuring residents that local law enforcement are prohibited from working with federal immigration and immigrants have legal rights.

On Friday Noem said one Minnesota county, that she did not name, has recently signed an 287(g) agreement that allows ICE to delegate authority and train local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions. She is looking to collaborate with smaller towns to partner on federal immigration operations, she said.

Local immigration attorneys said Noem’s data on arrests clashes with the information they have on their immigrant clients who have been detained by ICE in recent months. They also said an increase of federal immigration officers will likely result in more enforcement across Minnesota.

“The message that the administration wants to convey is very different than what the reality is of the average undocumented person,” said Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, a local immigration attorney.

Watching the press conference via live video feed, some attorneys said it felt similar to a political campaign in the way it perpetuated negative rhetoric towards immigrants.

“We need these immigrants and many of them coming from the border are not the worst of the worst that she is describing,” said Gloria Contreras Edin, a St. Paul immigration attorney.

“I do not agree with the criticism of the Consultative Commission on Human Rights regarding the infrastructure of the Maison de retour,” Minister of the Interior Léon Gloden said at a press conference on Friday morning.

The facility opened in October 2024 and is located in temporary structures in Hall 6 at Luxexpo in Kirchberg.

Both Gloden and Director General of Immigration Jean-Paul Reiter said on Friday that they want the facility to move to a permanent premises but cannot yet say when that will be.

Despite the temporary facilities, Gloden rejected most of the CCDH’s criticism. “One hall will remain, but renovation work will continue,” Gloden said, noting that sanitary facilities are to be renovated.

Voluntary return is an honest policy

“Voluntary return is part of an honest immigration policy,” said Gloden. The voluntary return procedure has already been introduced step by step, and the ministry of the interior will now promote it more strongly.

The principle of voluntary return has not changed, but the procedure for doing so has been adapted. Voluntary return applies to people whose asylum application has been rejected or who are staying in Luxembourg illegally, as well as asylum seekers deemed to be the responsibility of another EU country under the so-called Dublin rules.

The new voluntary return procedure provides for every asylum seeker to be informed about the possibility of voluntary return to their country of origin or a third country before a decision is made on their application. The asylum application and the voluntary return procedure are now carried out by two different immigration officials. Previously, one official handled both procedures. “It is extremely important that there is trust between the asylum seeker and the officials during both procedures,” Gloden said.

If an asylum seeker decides to return voluntarily, they are accommodated in the Maison de retour.

Reintegration programme

Another change to voluntary return is that people who opt for this procedure or whose asylum application has been rejected will be accompanied to their country of return by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Reintegration Programme (EURP).

If the asylum application is rejected, the person must leave the structures of the Office national de l'accueil (ONA) within 30 days. If they decide to return voluntarily, they will receive between €3,000 and €6,000, depending on criteria.

“Voluntary return is a form of cooperation,” said Gloden. “We want to offer these people prospects in their countries,” he added. This could be achieved through training and career counselling, among other things. Neither Gloden nor Reiter said what these look like in concrete terms, however.

In 2024, there were 274 voluntary returnees to 54 countries.

This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

A group of civil and human rights organizations is calling on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end the jailing of pregnant people and to immediately investigate reports of severe medical neglect in ICE jails in Louisiana and Georgia. A joint letter signed by the National Immigration Project, the American Civil Liberties Union and others describes the shackling of pregnant people during transport; solitary confinement; the denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food; and delayed or substandard medical care. They say one woman experienced a dangerous infection after a miscarriage due to ICE’s medical neglect.

Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy in order to construct a sprawling network of migrant detention centers in Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Utah. A source tells CNN that facilities could hold as many as 10,000 people each.

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution.

The landscape of immigration enforcement in the United States has shifted dramatically in recent months. In Colorado, Nicholas Pierce—a lawyer specializing in asylum and deportation defense—finds himself in a relentless race against changing federal policies. Each new directive, from the so-called “Freaky Friday” initiative that offered unaccompanied minors cash to self-deport, to the rollback of protections for groups like Venezuelan refugees, brings fresh uncertainty. Local human services agencies and families alike are left scrambling for answers, often with little guidance from official sources.

Pierce describes a system that has become both swifter and more unforgiving. “It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” he reflects, comparing the current crackdown to previous administrations. With hundreds of cases, he’s witnessed firsthand the profound disruption: legal statuses stripped, families forced into hiding, and children left without the right to hearings. The psychological toll is palpable, as some Coloradans are now advised to seek asylum in countries like Argentina or Chile—an option previously unthinkable.

Public opinion in Colorado is deeply divided, as evidenced by a CPR News and Colorado News Collaborative survey. While some residents support strict border controls, a majority express discomfort with the tactics being used—particularly when due process is circumvented and enforcement appears indiscriminate. One Grand Junction resident put it bluntly: “Ambushing families is despicable.” Another, from Durango, argued, “Deport criminals, not workers.” The refrain is clear: the desire for security must not come at the expense of basic human rights.

State leaders have responded with resistance. Attorney General Phil Weiser has fought federal actions in court, while lawmakers have passed bills to shield undocumented immigrants from attention. Despite these efforts, federal agents continue to execute raids, sometimes in ways that spark outrage—such as smashing car windows or detaining families with children at gunpoint. Even as state laws limit cooperation, interagency coordination persists, fueling tension among policymakers and advocates.

Economic Shockwaves: Chicago’s Restaurants and Workers in Peril

In Chicago, the consequences of the federal crackdown ripple through the city’s restaurant industry—a sector heavily reliant on immigrant labor. With increased ICE activity under operations like Midway Blitz and At Large, owners have taken drastic measures to protect staff: closing doors, shifting to takeout only, and locking entrances during business hours. The fear is pervasive, and its impact is immediate. “You can’t plan for this,” admits one restaurateur, who requested anonymity for safety.

Sales have plummeted for businesses like Taquizas Valdez and Cadinho Bakery, with foot traffic drying up as both workers and diners stay home. “You can definitely feel the streets are lonelier,” says Ivan Valdez. Online harassment compounds the anxiety, with some businesses receiving threats for displaying signs opposing ICE. The economic fallout is compounded by the human stories: street vendors have been detained, losing their livelihoods; families are separated, and owners worry about the well-being of their teams.

Yet, amid the fear, there is resilience. Community groups organize whistle events and restaurant crawls to alert neighborhoods about ICE activity and support local businesses. Owners like Omar Cadena and Eric Carlson describe a strengthened sense of solidarity, with neighbors and elected officials offering advice and resources. Fundraisers for immigrant rights groups are becoming more common, and the message is clear: immigrants are the backbone of Chicago’s vibrant food scene and economy. “They’re paying taxes, pumping money into the economy,” Cadena notes, highlighting the paradox of policies that target those who contribute most.

California’s Vigilance: Political Pushback and Community Mobilization

On the West Coast, the Bay Area remains on edge even after President Trump canceled a planned surge of federal enforcement in San Francisco. The announcement came after significant pressure from city leaders, business figures, and public outcry. But the sense of relief is tempered by caution. “San Francisco remains prepared for any scenario,” Mayor Daniel Lurie declared, echoing the region’s longstanding commitment to sanctuary policies.

The mood is tense. Federal agents’ presence on Coast Guard Island in Alameda sparked protests, with law enforcement deploying flash-bang grenades and pepper powder to disperse crowds. Local officials, including Oakland’s Barbara Lee, vow to support residents through legal means. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom continues to monitor developments, emphasizing the state’s unique role as a haven for immigrants and warning against federal overreach.

This tension plays out against a backdrop of broader political battles: Newsom has vetoed legislation citing hostile federal policies, and state leaders are fighting to preserve funding for critical services. The Bay Area’s story is one of vigilance—balancing preparedness with advocacy, and community mobilization with calls for reasoned governance.

National Pulse: Divided Opinions, Shifting Priorities

Polls reveal a country wrestling with its identity and priorities. In Colorado, concerns about illegal immigration vary by region: 90% on the Eastern Plains see it as a major problem, compared to just 46% in Denver. Meanwhile, 20% of Coloradans say the mistreatment of immigrants is an “extremely serious” concern, with higher sensitivity in urban areas. Nationally, a Gallup poll finds that only 30% of Americans now support reducing immigration—a notable decline from the previous year, with most opposition clustered along party lines.

Debate centers not only on numbers but on fairness. A New York Times/Sienna survey reports that 53% of voters believe deportation processes have not been fair, with many questioning the government’s aggressive tactics. The friction is evident: while some see strict enforcement as a necessity to protect resources and order, others warn of the social and economic costs—particularly the erosion of due process and compassion.

These divisions shape the actions of leaders and communities alike. In Colorado, legal battles and policy reforms continue. In Chicago, restaurant owners rally to support their staff and neighbors. In California, officials remain vigilant, ready to resist federal intervention. Across the country, stories of hardship and resilience abound, painting a complex portrait of a nation at a crossroads.

America’s immigration crackdown has exposed deep fractures—between security and compassion, local autonomy and federal power, economic necessity and political ideology. The voices from Colorado, Chicago, and California reveal a country searching for balance: striving to uphold laws while honoring the human stories behind every policy. Ultimately, the test will be whether communities and leaders can forge solutions that respect both the rule of law and the dignity of those who seek a better life within America’s borders.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/America-Immigration.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:57:28.930197

In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.","The Department of Homeland Security has sent unaccompanied immigrant teenagers $5,000 fines for illegally entering the United States, according to youth advocates and fine notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept.

Roughly 10 teenagers in New York, ages 14 to 17, received the fine in mid-October, said Meena Shah, managing director of the Legal Services Center at The Door, a New York City-based nonprofit that serves young people. At least one teenager in Michigan has received the fine too, according to the teen’s lawyer. New York Focus and The Intercept reviewed copies of the fine notices delivered in both New York and Michigan.

The fine is one of several new financial penalties for immigrants created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July. The federal government is issuing the fines under a section of the law titled “Inadmissible alien apprehension fee,” which is set at $5,000 and can be applied to people apprehended between official ports of entry. Homeland Security’s application of the fine hasn’t been previously reported.

Shah and Ana Raquel Devereaux, the attorney representing the teenager in Michigan, both said the kids are living in shelters overseen by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, which takes custody of unaccompanied immigrant children while they wait to be released to an adult sponsor.

Devereaux, who works for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, pointed out that kids in government custody have no ability to work.

“It’s really about creating fear,” Devereaux said. “There’s no way that a child in this situation would be able to pay this, and the penalties are so severe.”

Minors in Texas and Pennsylvania have received the fines too, according to a staff member at a national nonprofit who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the nonprofit’s leadership fears being targeted by the Trump administration.

The fine is one of several ways the Trump administration has sought in recent weeks to pressure minors who entered the U.S. alone to return to their home countries. Over Labor Day weekend, the government attempted to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children who were in ORR custody; kids were loaded onto planes before a judge halted the plan. In early October, the government said it was offering $2,500 to unaccompanied minors 14 years and older who agree to leave the country.

The notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept state that “Payment in full is due now” and list an array of potential consequences for failure to pay, including collection litigation and negative impacts on their immigration cases. Fines that aren’t paid in full will accrue interest, the notices say.

“They’re trying to pressure and coerce these young people into taking voluntary departure,” Shah said. “These are the stressors you’re putting very young kids under.”

Border Patrol teased the apprehension fee in a September 24 Facebook post, which included a megaphone emoji and said anyone 14 years or older could be fined. Money collected from the fines will be credited to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Other fees created by the new law include $100 to apply for asylum, plus $100 every year the application is pending; $550 for asylum-seekers to apply for a work permit; and $5,000 for anyone ordered removed in absentia and then arrested by ICE. Lack of clarity over exactly how and when to pay the $100 fees recently sparked panic among asylum-seekers in New York and a flood of misinformation and potential scams, New York Focus recently reported.

In response to questions about the $5,000 fee being applied to minors, the Department of Homeland Security referred New York Focus and The Intercept to a press release about a different fee of $1,000 for immigrants paroled into the U.S. The agency did not respond to follow-up questions.

Supporters of the fine argue that it will incentivize people to cross at legal entry points rather than traverse dangerous desert terrain and take up Customs and Border Protection resources. Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for restrictions on immigration, said he understood the argument that a teenager won’t be able to pay a $5,000 fine, but said their parents or relatives would then be on the hook.

“This isn’t, you know, ‘We want to punish 14-year-old kids,’” Arthur said. “This is, ‘We want to discourage parents from paying smugglers to bring their kids to the United States.’”

It’s unclear how many immigrants have received the $5,000 fine. Several attorneys who work with unaccompanied minors in New York and other states told New York Focus they’d heard about the fines secondhand but hadn’t seen any cases personally. All of the cases New York Focus and The Intercept were able to verify involved teenagers in ORR custody, but advocates said they had heard of minors outside of federal custody receiving the fines.

Under Trump, the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border and entering ORR custody has plummeted. In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.

Theo Liebmann, a law professor at Hofstra University who runs a legal clinic for immigrant youth, said unaccompanied kids in ORR custody are particularly vulnerable because they often don’t have lawyers, having recently arrived in the U.S.

Liebmann, who doesn’t have any clients who have received the fine, said it appeared to be an effort to “go after the kids who are especially defenseless and won’t be able to understand how to look at this threat, how real this threat is, and what they can do in response.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241884413-e1761341003294.jpg?fit=3000%2C1500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-24 22:56:36.226530

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday issued a so-called administrative stay on an Oct. 20 ruling by a sharply divided three-judge panel. The stay means an Oct. 4 decision by a lower court judge to block deployment is back in effect for at least the next several days.

In the meantime, a full complement of appellate judges will consider holding a so-called en banc rehearing to review whether the 2-1 decision was correct on the law. Oregon requested the rehearing, as did the dissenting judge who said it was a dangerous decision.

“This administrative order expresses no views on the merits of this matter and is not a reconsideration of the earlier stay order,” Senior Circuit Judge Sidney R. Thomas said in the order.

The Portland dispute comes as Trump continues to tout his plans to bring state National Guard troops under federal control and send them into Democratic-led cities where he claims violent protesters are impeding the activities of US immigration agents. Similar suits are challenging Trump’s deployments to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Chicago.

Oregon argues a rehearing is warranted because the 2-1 ruling was wrong on the law. Friday’s order suggests the appeals court will complete its vote on whether to hold the review by Oct. 28, a day before the start of three-day trial in Portland on the merits of Oregon’s suit challenging the deployment.

The Portland is being being overseen by US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee whose initial order against the deployment concluded the president was exaggerating the severity of the protests.

The case is State of Oregon vs. Donald Trump, 3:25-cv-01756, US District Court, District of Oregon (Portland).

The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday's flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS.

Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault.

DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety.

""These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January.

McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.

According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia's Pacific coast. The most recent strike, conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was ""a lethal kinetic strike"" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. ""Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike … all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed,"" Hegseth said.

Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.

The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, part of a buildup of U.S. forces in the region.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/16/949d4f01-3ed6-4672-9dae-a782eb79be9e/thumbnail/1200x630/43d1783df1fe7038a087fc25d37980ec/gettyimages-2235443593.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 22:16:52.649125
