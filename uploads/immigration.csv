Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food.","Not long into his confinement at the sprawling immigrant detention center in Tacoma, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino heard swearing as dinner was served. “Hey, look at this,” said the man swearing as he brought his tray over for Juarez to see.

On it was chicken, normally the best food the Northwest ICE Processing Center has to offer, the Skagit Valley farmworker and labor organizer had been told. But on this day, the meat sat in a pool of blood. He inspected his own chicken and saw the same. He lifted the skin to take a closer look. “It was just raw,” he said.

“Everybody got mad and shouted that we weren’t going to eat this,” Juarez said. People returned their food to a cart. Close to 1 a.m., as he recalled, officers brought in sandwiches.

In March, the then-25-year-old had entered a world that, for many people, remains a mystery. The privately run detention center is one of the biggest such facilities nationwide, with 1,575 beds.

Advocates have for years called attention to conditions, collecting thousands of complaints from immigrants held there and submitting them to the state health department. Government agencies and human rights groups have written reports citing concerns. Immigrants locked up there have launched repeated hunger strikes, and some have tried to kill themselves. In 2018, one did.

But the low-lying gray building, surrounded by a chain-link fence, is rarely seen from the inside except by people who work there or are “detained.” Many people don’t even know what that word means, or how it differs from imprisonment. Even some who do would undoubtedly be surprised that one man has been held in ICE’s Tacoma facility for seven years.

More and more immigrants are learning about detention firsthand under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort. A record number are being held, nearly 60,000 nationally, according to the government’s September figures.

At Trump’s request, Congress has allocated billions of dollars to expand immigrant detention.

Already, the Northwest detention center’s surging population is putting a strain on the facility, exacerbating long-standing complaints and generating new ones, according to interviews with people currently and formerly held there, court declarations and accounts from lawyers and advocates. Many, like Juarez, tell stories of undercooked food and meals arriving in the middle of the night.

They also cite erratic access to outdoor recreation, little to no provided toiletries like soap, unclean uniforms and stained underwear, and long waits for medical care and legal visits. The atmosphere, they said, is tense amid new policies that offer little chance of getting out beyond being deported. Sometimes, even those ready for that outcome can’t leave quickly.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the facility and provides its medical care, and the GEO Group, the Florida-based corporation running it since 2005, declined interview requests.

“False narratives about ICE detention facilities undermine the hard work of our dedicated professionals,” a spokesperson for the federal agency said in a statement. “ICE facilities operate under strict standards, including accreditation requirements for medical care and staffing.”

A GEO spokesperson said the company provides an array of services, including “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

Those familiar with ICE’s Tacoma facility say it does not have the harshest conditions. Some detention centers operate in remote locations far from attorneys, lawyers and outside observers, said Michelle Brané, formerly the immigration detention ombudsman for the Biden administration. “They’re really running in the shadows.”

On one occasion, an asylum-seeker asked to be transferred there because he heard it was one of the better detention centers.

“I would say that it is fairly typical,” Brané said of the Tacoma facility, its problems endemic to the unique system it is in.

From cold holding cell to tense unit

Juarez, who had no criminal record, arrived at ICE’s Tacoma facility the way many immigrants do: in handcuffs, ankle shackles and a chain around his waist.

He had been stopped by federal agents early that morning as he was driving his partner to work picking Skagit Valley tulips, and taken first to a small, unmarked building, he recalled recently. It was 9 or 10 at night when he reached Tacoma and was placed in a crowded holding cell with others waiting to be processed. He met construction workers in dirty clothes they hadn’t yet changed out of, a father and son, and residents of Seattle, Eastern Washington and Portland.

The hours dragged on. “It was really cold and we couldn’t really sleep,” he said. They tried, on the concrete floor, with no blankets.

He was called out around 4 or 5 in the morning, given a blue uniform that signifies low risk, and placed in a two-tier residential unit. Some units have cells where groups of people sleep, but his was a large open area with bunk beds, Juarez said. The unit also had tables and chairs, a microwave, sink and three TVs.

One TV was always set to English-language programming, one to Spanish-language. Juarez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, speaks both languages, but some people spoke neither, having immigrated from Russia, Turkey, Egypt and elsewhere. What to watch was a source of contention.

“There was always a high risk of a fight breaking out over the smallest thing,” Juarez said.

Still, the well-regarded labor organizer, whose detainment generated community outrage, said he got along with most everyone. He would buy instant ramen soup and macaroni and cheese from the commissary and share with those who didn’t have money.

Sometimes, he helped immigrants who had lost their cases write requests to be deported as soon as possible so they could get out of detention. One he recalled as waiting at least two months.

Days after Juarez arrived, an officer came into his unit with a list of people to be deported right away. Juarez’s name was on it. “Pack your stuff, you’re going tonight,” he said he was told.

Years before, a judge had ordered Juarez removed after he didn’t appear at a court hearing. Juarez said notice of the hearing had gone to the wrong address and he didn’t know about the removal order until he was detained. His lawyer, Larkin VanDerhoef, quickly filed a court motion that stopped him from being deported that night.

Months ticked by. “I started having vision problems because the lights were on pretty much 24/7,” some of them anyway, he said. He went to the “sick call” area one day, where immigrants line up starting as early as 5 a.m. to see health care providers.

There weren’t enough providers to see many of them, Juarez said. He went back to his unit and didn’t try again.

In July, after a judge declined to release Juarez on bond, he opted for “voluntary departure” to Mexico. He lives there now, hoping to find a way to come back to the U.S.

“Stuck in quicksand”

A paradox defines the detention system. It is part of a civil system that’s supposed to be, as ICE says on its website, “non-punitive.” Yet, it operates like a jail or prison system, an Obama-era ICE official noted in a 2009 report.

The Trump administration, which consistently portrays detained immigrants as dangerous, apparently sees no contradiction.

To be sure, some detained immigrants have committed crimes, including entering the country illegally. But whatever punishment they receive in the criminal legal system is intended to be separate from detention, which ICE standards say exists “for no purpose other than to secure their presence both for immigration proceedings and their removal.”

An array of immigrants without formal legal status in the U.S. can be detained, including people who overstay visas (which is not a crime) and asylum-seekers who entered the country without breaking any laws. In some cases, lawful residents with criminal convictions have also been held by ICE.

At the Tacoma detention center, roughly 60% of those reported in September ICE records as being held were categorized as noncriminal.

Despite similarities, detention and criminal incarceration differ in key ways. Those confined to prison have a fixed sentence. Those detained do not.

“It could be three days. It could be three years,” said Brané, the former ombudsman.

Some might be whisked away using a fast-track removal process the Trump administration increasingly deploys. Others are held until a judge or administrative body issues a final ruling on whether they can stay in the U.S. Huge backlogs impede the immigration court and appeals system, adding to the uncertainty of how long detention stretches on.

“It’s like you’re stuck in quicksand,” said Javier Martinez.

Martinez is the man who has been held at the Tacoma detention center for seven years.

The 44-year-old has applied to stay in the U.S. based on what he says is a fear of torture should he be deported, in part for political reasons. His case is complicated, involving two countries he could be deported to, Costa Rica, where he was born, and Nicaragua, where he is a citizen.

While his case has gone through multiple levels of review, he has tried and failed to get bond through every legal avenue, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Once a lawful resident, Martinez’s biggest stumbling block has been two cocaine distribution convictions before ICE took him into custody.

He served prison time for those convictions, offering him a point of comparison. In prison, Martinez earned a GED, obtained a waste management certificate and took parenting classes.

Martinez has found no such activities in detention, designed for comparatively short stays. “Sometimes, I just sit there and I feel like a vegetable,” Martinez said. Even getting to walk around or play sports outside has been tough lately. “Sometimes we have yard and sometimes we don’t,” he said.

He attributes that, as well as irregular meal times that have him going to bed hungry rather than waiting for dinner, to insufficient staffing.

After a steep decline in population due to COVID and slowed immigration enforcement, the detention center’s population has roughly doubled since January, according to immigration lawyers who regularly visit and ICE figures provided to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Other detained immigrants said it’s patently clear the Tacoma facility is short-staffed. In a lawsuit on behalf of five immigrants held there for more than six months, plaintiff Jesus Bento Cardozo said in an April declaration that one officer frequently oversees two units. “The guard typically goes back and forth between two units and is sometimes gone for as long as 45 minutes or an hour. I worry that something bad could happen.”

As the only person in his unit to speak Konkani, an Indian language, Cardozo also said in his declaration: “I feel very isolated here.”

In Martinez’s particularly low periods, he has turned to a chaplain at the Tacoma facility.

“He’s a great guy,” Martinez said. “You can request to have a one-on-one with him, or a prayer session with him and he will come to the unit.” In a separate area, volunteers lead religious services.

But Martinez may have reached his limit on how much detention he can take. He is now considering an agreement to leave the U.S.

Detained while pregnant

In recent months, Martinez has noticed a new level of despair among those detained with him.

Until several years ago, many stood a decent chance of getting bond in Tacoma’s immigration court located within the detention center, but that changed as judges started automatically denying release to most immigrants who entered the country illegally. A U.S. District Court in September ruled the practice unlawful, and the federal government — which in July made the practice a nationwide policy — has indicated it will appeal.

In the past, ICE refrained from taking some people into custody for humanitarian reasons. A Biden-era policy, for instance, directed ICE officers to refrain from detaining pregnant, postpartum and nursing immigrants in most circumstances. ICE’s website notes the policy “is not reflective of current practice.”

Alejandra Gonza, executive director of a human rights legal group called Global Rights Advocacy, said she knows of three pregnant women who have been recently held at ICE’s Tacoma facility.

One, Anelys Garcés Infante, was taken there in July. A Venezuelan asylum-seeker living at the time in Oregon, Garcés Infante, 27, said she had been arrested on a shoplifting-related charge and ICE officers took her into custody as she left a sheriff’s office.

After advocates and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon pressed ICE to release Garcés Infante, the agency did so in early October, allowing her to continue her immigration court case while living in the community. Her lawyer, VanDerhoef, who also represented Juarez, said it’s the first grant of a procedure known as humanitarian parole he is aware of under the Trump administration.

Seattle midwife Amanda Heffernan visited Garcés Infante at the detention center and contributed to a release request supported by Seattle University’s International Human Rights Clinic and Global Rights Advocacy. “She walked in and I was like, oh my goodness, this person looks really thin and really sick,” Heffernan recalled in an interview.

Garcés Infante had been nauseous, throwing up and losing weight. Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food. The extra sandwich she got because she is pregnant, bolognalike meat on white bread, was so unappetizing she didn’t eat it. The meals she got relied heavily on beans, which don’t agree with her stomach.

“I just don’t feel good here,” she said in Spanish.

She worried that her baby or babies — an early ultrasound indicated she may be carrying twins — would be malnourished.

She received prenatal vitamins and medical care in detention, and said the doctors there treated her well. The facility called an ambulance to take her to the hospital when she was experiencing severe pain, Garcés Infante said. The hospital gave her medication.

But in Heffernan’s opinion, Garcés Infante needed more specialized care, especially because of possible twins, than detention offers.

Where’s the oversight?

Inspections by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman during previous administrations often haven’t fixed problems but they have cataloged some. Among those cited in reports on the Tacoma facility over the past two years: medical understaffing, inconsistent suicide-watch checks and preventive health screenings, and foods stored years past their “best-by” dates.

That oversight is now shrinking. The Trump administration largely defunded the detention ombudsman’s and Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which investigates complaints. A legal challenge is ongoing.

Washington state’s Department of Health, which has received 2,800 complaints since 2023, is attempting to step in. It is backed by recent state laws explicitly giving the agency authority to conduct inspections.

“I have been shocked by the complaints that we hear,” said Lauren Jenks, a department assistant secretary. One of her top concerns is the drinking water, which more than 100 complaints to her department describe as strange looking, smelling and tasting.

The department believes there’s something wrong with pipes inside the building, which it could help fix. But GEO and ICE have long prevented state health inspectors from coming in, which is being litigated in court. (The litigation also involves the state Department of Labor & Industries, which the detention center has allowed in to conduct workplace safety inspections but would likely do so more frequently under state legislation challenged by GEO.)",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10082025_ICE_tzr_115243.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:41.485090

“Texas National Guard can stay in Illinois but can’t activate, court says. Here’s what to know about the unit.” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Many arrived in shorts and flip-flops.

I had partnered with local restaurateur Eldridge Williams to help feed and clothe the group, who had been bused up to my hometown along with other “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas as part of an inhumane political stunt. Chicagoans stepped up to aid these people in need.

It was a strain, as Mr. Abbott knew it would be. The newly elected mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, had to reallocate already tight resources to help. Much of the responsibility of providing for the Venezuelans ended up being shouldered by Chicago’s Black community: Shelters were placed in our neighborhoods, and services were diverted away from our most vulnerable.

The apparent chaos of these arrivals, hyped by the right-wing media, helped re-elect Donald Trump. And it led directly to what happened this past week, when the federal government began treating my city like enemy territory. Rappelling out of helicopters like in a scene from “Black Hawk Down,” federal agents raided an apartment building in the predominantly Black community of South Shore, knocking down doors, separating children from their zip-tied parents and detaining people barely clothed.

Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity. But the effects rained down on Black citizens who were caught up in the raid, too. Some Black Chicagoans expressed indignation and disbelief at seeing us be brutalized by Mr. Trump’s deployments, with one young brother exclaiming as he watched federal agents appear to choke a Black man on the street, “Ya’ll supposed to be choking Mexicans.”

At its heart, his comment speaks to Mr. Trump’s success in dividing us from one another and our humanity: a nagging devil on the shoulder of struggling Americans barely scraping together the rent and telling them someone else is to blame. It also reflects the divisions within the African diaspora, where it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that—like my own father—many Black people are also immigrants, experiencing their own traumas at the sight of these cruelties.

I visited the apartment complex on 75th Street and South Shore Drive after the raid. A friend of mine who is a journalist, Maira Khwaja of the Invisible Institute, had been one of the first on the ground and warned me of the wreckage that had been left behind by the mayhem, but seeing it in person was shocking. Tension loomed in the air even days later. A child’s soiled pink unicorn toy seemed to cry out for help beneath a broken headboard and an uprooted mattress. My heart breaks for the lessons of worthlessness being taught to these children.

Conversations with the victims of ICE’s South Shore raid reveal a people divided. One man expressed love for his new Venezuelan neighbors, one of whom helped him fix his car. Others burn with contempt, like a hot coal in weathered hands. These are hands that all too often can’t find work and are perfectly primed for pointing the finger. “I don’t agree with how they did it, but they needed to get them out,” said one disgruntled neighborhood resident.

And I get it: Not long ago, I welcomed a friend home from prison with the help of Gov. JB Pritzker. I was hopeful he’d be eligible for subsidized housing through the state’s re-entry programs, only to find that many of the opportunities had been siphoned off to the Venezuelan immigrants, and nothing was available. A crisis of conservative design, this desperate scramble for scarce resources is a rife breeding ground for ethnic animosity.

The reality of the Black American experience is that being at the heel of a racially unjust society means that the oppression of anyone invariably affects us.

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs. This is the city of the disgraced detective Jon Burge, who, after leaving the military police, joined the Chicago Police Department and deployed what have been likened to military black sites to torture what has been estimated to be over 100 Black men in the 1970s to early ’90s, causing the city to pay out over $100 million in settlements. After Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014, protests erupted downtown over his death. Then, after George Floyd, as in other cities full of people fed up with police brutality, many of us took to the streets. Some protesters vandalized property in that heated moment.

The question now is: How will Chicago’s residents respond? The protests started small, but as the stakes of the federal incursion ramp up, with Mr. Trump ordering Department of Homeland Security agents in and attempting to deploy the National Guard as well (which has been blocked, for now, by the courts), the crowds have gotten bigger and the mood more defiant. The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls. All of this could eventually provoke peaceful demonstrators into revolt, which would also turn Chicago into the “war zone” Mr. Trump and his administration keep saying our city is, as a justification for his sending in his forces in the first place.

In Season 7 of Showtime’s “The Chi,” a show on which I appear as the character Jamal, there’s a moment when he’s shot in an attack meant for someone else and he has to wrestle with how to respond. In my creative exploration for the role, I contemplated the enormous weight of forgiveness and restraint. I sat in silence with Jamal’s gnawing, burning urge for revenge. I thought of the damage and the destruction it would do to his family, to his younger sister, who was left abandoned during Jamal’s previous incarceration. And ultimately, for the greater good of himself, and his loved ones, my character decided against it.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12mensa-mkfh/12mensa-mkfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:32.172199

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights.
Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable.
Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety.
He is also the editor of the book “A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America,” written by his father Harry Kalven Jr.","Where is the line between “democracy” and “fascism”? Since President Donald Trump’s return to power nine months ago, that question has been posed again and again in response to the latest affront to human dignity, common sense and/or constitutional norms committed by his administration.

Arguably, however, this is the wrong question in that it assumes there is some precise threshold beyond which we cease to be free. Those who have experienced fascist takeovers elsewhere warn that if we insist on a definitive answer to that question, we will only belatedly realize that the walls have closed in around us. The danger is that we will drift — disoriented, unmoored, bewildered — into the iron cage of tyranny.

While there may be no red line from which to take our bearings, recent events have pulled back the curtain on the nature and trajectory of the Trump regime’s fascist project. In their haste to exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk, Trump and senior members of his team have revealed their contempt for fundamental First Amendment principles. The president has ruminated about the possibility of making it a crime to criticize him. Multiple voices in the administration have demanded punishment for anyone who speaks of Kirk in less than reverential terms. Calling for a crusade against the forces of “evil” and “wickedness,” Trump’s chief of staff Stephen Miller has conjured a vast left-wing “domestic terror network.” Vice President JD Vance has said it is exemplified by the Nation magazine and the Open Society Institute founded by George Soros.

(Full disclosure: I am a Nation contributor and have been an Open Society fellow. So if you are curious about the face of terrorism, according to the administration, I’m your guy.)

The “us versus them” logic of fascism is voracious. We have seen the category of “the enemy within” rapidly expand from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gang members to the majority of the population that dissents from the MAGA-certified state ideology.

What has been revealed in recent weeks is ugly but deeply familiar. We have seen it before, and we have seen effective resistance to it. What is critical at this juncture is to be clear about the nature of the threat. Even with a supine Congress and compliant Supreme Court, it is unlikely the administration could effectively repeal the First Amendment by turning seditious libel (criticism of the government) and blasphemy into crimes. Rather, it has adopted a transparent strategy of seeking to provoke civil disorder in order to justify crushing dissent.

Sixty years ago, my father Harry Kalven Jr., a constitutional scholar, coined the term “heckler’s veto” to describe a situation in which those hostile to a speaker’s message seek to suppress it by threatening disorder. If the police restore order by silencing the speaker, they give the heckler a veto over public discussion. Censorship is thus achieved by a circuitous process.

The context in which my father developed the heckler’s veto concept was the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s, when those engaged in nonviolent protests against segregation in the South were often met by hostile crowds. Local authorities would then use the threat of disorder as a rationale for suppressing the protests.

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights. Among the photographs that illuminate that moment, one is especially telling: the image of 6-year-old Ruby Bridges entering a previously all-white elementary school, accompanied by U.S. marshals, while hostile white people jeer and heckle.

Today, the federal government is the heckler. Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable. Rather, at the direction of the heckler-in-chief, they are designed to provoke disorder that can then be seized upon as a rationale for declaring a state of emergency and suppressing dissent.

This theater of cruelty — masked federal agents terrorizing migrant families and brazenly attacking protesters and journalists — is not a matter of misconduct by the officers involved. On the contrary, they are delivering the message the administration intends to send.

In this respect, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement television commercial seeking to recruit local officers that has recently been airing in Chicago is revealing. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,” the ad declares. “Join ICE, and help us catch the worst of the worst.” The subtext is clear: Join us and be relieved of constitutional constraints and the nuisance of accountability. Enjoy impunity.

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety. Similarly, declaring Chicago a sanctuary city is an expression of care for and solidarity with our neighbors. These civic aspirations are now under siege. In contrast to the federal interventions of the 1960s in support of those working to desegregate the Jim Crow South, we now confront a white supremacist regime seeking to undo the limited but real achievements of pluralism and tolerance.

While there is reason to hope that legal challenges to federal intervention and to ICE practices will ultimately prevail, it is important to recognize that we confront a rogue regime that has contempt for the rule of law and is in the process of building a massive paramilitary force answerable only to the president.

The terms of engagement are thus daunting. They are also clear. It is up to us all — elected officials, civil society, the press — to defend First Amendment freedoms by exercising them in the place where we live. Challenges abound: for protesters, to maintain nonviolent discipline; for public officials, to hold their ground in the face of economic retaliation; for police and military, to honor their oath to uphold the Constitution when given clearly unconstitutional orders; and for the press, to remain agile and work together to bear witness to events on the ground.

In meeting the moment, we can take heart from historian Hannah Arendt’s distinction between violence and power, which she saw as opposites. Power arises when people act together for a common purpose, as Chicagoans have been doing across the city by confronting ICE, providing legal and material aid to those targeted by the federal dragnet, and building networks for sharing information. Seen in isolation, these efforts may be small-scale and intensely local, but in the aggregate, they are building capacity for civil resistance. Violence, by contrast, is purely instrumental. It can destroy power but not create it. It is an expression of impotence. Only people acting in concert can generate power.

The great Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who was well acquainted with sectarian violence, said it best: “What looks the strongest has outlived its term. The future lies with what’s affirmed from under.”

Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.","When Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was 12 minutes late for his shift at Tom & Jerry's Gyros, a diner on Chicago's northwest side, his manager knew something was wrong.

The short-order cook always let someone know if he was running late, even by just five minutes. Earlier that morning, Villegas Gonzalez, 38, had been fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, shortly after dropping his children off at a school and daycare in the suburb of Franklin Park.

The agents were attempting to arrest him as part of a massive immigration sweep launched by US President Donald Trump. Villegas Gonzalez was the Chicago crackdown's first casualty.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, after the 12 September incident, that Villegas Gonzalez was ""a criminal illegal alien"" with ""a history of reckless driving"", who steered his car at agents, causing one to fear for his life and fire his weapon, killing Villegas Gonzalez.

DHS told Reuters on Friday (local time) that it would conduct its own investigation into the incident, after the first agency that responded had finished its review.

Both Franklin Park police and the FBI responded to the shooting incident, but it wasn't clear which agency was investigating.

The FBI declined to comment, citing a lack of staff to respond to media inquiries, due to the government shutdown.

Franklin Park police did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

A reserved boy from Irimbo

Reuters interviews with family and coworkers, and a review of public records, present a more nuanced picture of a man who left his quiet village years ago for economic opportunity and worked long hours to support his children.

A man who had become sober after heavy drinking, resulting in liver disease, and who had become one woman's steadfast partner.

""He was so soft-spoken,"" said Ashley Alekna, manager of the diner, describing him as a kind, dependable presence during his 11-hour shifts in a kitchen full of boisterous personalities, making food for the crowds that spilled in from the community college across the street.

Villegas Gonzalez made a similar impression on partner Blanca Mora, when they were growing up in Irimbo, a small town in Michoacán, Mexico.

Mora said they were in their early teens, when they started greeting each other around town, meeting to chat on the corner near her grandparents' house.

People often leave Irimbo for opportunities beyond the tiny town, including Villegas Gonzalez's older brother, Jorge.

Jorge, who first went to the US in 1998, remembers his little brother watching him walk away.

""He was a kid,"" said Jorge. ""He hid, so I wouldn't see him crying.""

Father of two

In 2007, Silverio followed his brother north, part of a wave of more than 348,000 Mexican emigrants to the US that year, US Census data showed, as President Felipe Calderon's violent war against drug cartels deepened.

Villegas Gonzalez found employment in the restaurant kitchens, where - according to recent National Restaurant Association data - 46 percent of the nation's chefs and 31 percent of its cooks are foreign-born.

He met a woman and they had two sons. Jorge Villegas Gonzalez said his younger brother often struggled to cover the bills.

Between 2011-19, Villegas Gonzalez was cited for a handful of traffic offences, one for driving more than 48kmh over the speed limit.

He was also ticketed for driving an uninsured vehicle and having a broken taillight. He had no criminal record.

His abuse of alcohol during those years led to a diagnosis of liver disease, he told Alekna later. A doctor told him that, if he kept drinking, it would kill him.

He had been sober for more than a year when he died, co-workers and Mora said.

Mora and Villegas Gonzalez fell out of touch, when he moved to the US, but she eventually moved there too, looking for her mother, who had left Mexico to better support her three children years before.

She never found her mother, but she found love with the reserved boy from home. She visited him when he was sick and later the two became a couple. Villegas Gonzalez, his two sons, Mora and her 13-year-old daughter eventually all lived together in Franklin Park.

A family in Franklin Park

Mora said Villegas Gonzalez took his sons to the library three times a week, played with Lego and banned phones at the dinner table, so the newly blended family could focus on each other.

He began to open up to his co-workers, said Alekna, cracking little jokes throughout the day. When his younger son celebrated his birthday, they helped him bake a Minecraft video game-themed cake with green icing.

The morning he was killed, Villegas Gonzalez dropped his older son off at Passow Elementary School in Franklin Park and then his younger son at Small World Learning Center, just around the corner. Minutes later, surveillance video from a nail salon showed ICE agents pulling him over, each leaning into his front car windows.

Villegas Gonzalez backed up and tried to drive away, as the agent on the passenger side chased on foot. The agent on the driver's side was not visible, as Villegas Gonzalez drove forward.

In separate surveillance footage from another nearby business, what sounds like two gunshots can be heard around the same time. Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.

A few hours later, Jorge Villegas Gonzalez was driving a minibus through the streets of Irimbo when he got the call that his brother was dead.

Villegas Gonzalez's two boys were taken to foster care, Mora said.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.
Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.
“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.
And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.","The national guard troops Donald Trump sent to Illinois can remain in the state and under federal control but can’t be deployed, an appeals court ruled on Saturday.

The appeals court granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments.

The decision to prevent the troops from protecting federal property or going on patrol comes after federal judge April Perry ruled on Thursday to temporarily block the national guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois as Trump continues his immigration crackdown in major cities across the US.

On Friday, Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they had visited an immigration enforcement building near Chicago but were barred from going inside.

The senators stopped by the facility in suburban Broadview on Friday, requesting a tour of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility and to deliver supplies to protesters who have been demonstrating at the site for weeks.

Their visit coincides with a ruling that the fencing installed at the site must be taken down. A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.

Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.

“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.

“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”

“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”

The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.

“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”

To the south, in Tennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.

They also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.

Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.

By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.

The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said the Trump administration had violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.

In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.

“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.

“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.

An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.

Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3369c14ac045b44fc198005afcd52efd994da41f/483_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae0103029435ab57fff1cde4f9139fb",N,,2025-10-12 02:56:40.876057

As the sun began to set, Illinois State Police tried to disperse the crowd, enforcing an executive order signed by the village's mayor to limit protesting hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

“We’re agitated by this restriction, by the way,” said Dr. Alli Muhammad, national leader of the Revolutionary Black Panther Party. “We feel that the mayor of Broadview, she considers herself an ally, but we’re not comfortable with this 9 to 6 curfew, so we’re going to present this cease and desist to remove the curfew.”

Earlier in the day, religious leaders marched from St. Eulalia Catholic Church in Maywood to the processing facility during a eucharistic procession.

Clergy members arrived, praying for the people detained and even attempted to serve communion to those inside but they were denied access.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin joined faith-based leaders and community members for a service at the church before the procession.

“I am here as an elected representative with this organization and these people to tell them what is going on.

The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit also ruled that the force could remain under federal control for now.

The decision partially upheld a lower court ruling that blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area, which said it was ""likely to lead to civil unrest"" and ""only add fuel to the fire"".

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.

He has argued troops were needed to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, but local officials have filed lawsuits accusing him of exceeding his legal authority.

Chicago has been a particular flashpoint since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz in September to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Trump's September deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon is still being challenged in the courts.

Last week, it was blocked by Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House.

She wrote that the administration's justification for the deployment ""was simply untethered to the facts"".

In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell at-times violent protests over immigration raids in the city.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.
During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.
“There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile.
Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz “Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.","A federal judge has ruled that a controversial security fence constructed around the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview is violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land and ordered its removal.

In a ruling Thursday night, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt said it was clear from the government’s own arguments that “there is no plan to take the fence down and that ‘Operation Midway Blitz‘ currently has no end in sight.”

In addition, the judge said, ICE acting Director Todd Lyons wrote in a letter to the village that the agency has an issue with “unlawful assemblies” of protesters and there “will be no change in our operational posture” until the demonstrations stop.

“In other words, the (defendants’) current operations are indefinite and the protests — which Acting Director Lyons seemingly considers to fall into the category of ‘unlawful activities’ — will undoubtedly continue,” Hunt wrote in her opinion. “Under these circumstances, the court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon.”

The fence must be removed by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, the judge ordered.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a written statement the ruling was “a decisive win for public safety.”

“The judge’s decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview’s ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders,” Thompson wrote. “The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, decried “activist judges” and local leaders she says are attempting to stop lawful immigration enforcement.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “It is shameful that this is coming less than one week after the attack by domestic terrorists who rammed their cars into our DHS officers’ vehicles.”

The fence, she said, was extended only after “rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.”

The village of Broadview last week filed a motion for a restraining order requiring the removal of the 8-foot-tall fence, which was constructed around the temporary holding facility on Beach Street that has seen daily protests and federal agents using tear gas and other weapons on crowds.

During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.

“It is very charged, it is very challenging,” Hunt said. “There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile. But those issues are not before me.”

Attorneys for Broadview argued that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, constructed the fence “in the middle of the night without notice,” and that it not only physically deprives the village of its right to control its own land, but constitutes a public safety hazard by blocking emergency service personnel and vehicles from reaching several commercial and industrial properties located on the other side.

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said the village still has access to the area through a key-card gate on another street, and that complaints that the gate was too small for fire trucks did not hold water.

Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz

“Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.

Walsh said the government had “no other option” than to put up the fence because protesters were gathering day after day and accosting law enforcement outside the facility, inciting violence and slashing tires of ICE vehicles pulling in and out of a secure lot.

“This went on for weeks,” Walsh said. “If the fence comes down, it is very foreseeable that the same kind of violence is going to occur.”

Hunt pointed out the building had been there for 40 years without issue, yet no one seemed to have a plan for protesters once the Trump administration’s immigration push began.

The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday.

The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds.

By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, the president blamed Democrats, as he estimated that “a lot” of workers would be affected and asserted the layoffs would be “Democrat-oriented.”

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.
“I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.” Gov.","A federal appeals court in Chicago on Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request for an emergency stay of a district judge’s order barring the president from deploying National Guard troops in the city and state.

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.

The ruling keeps in effect Perry’s granting of a temporary restraining order Thursday halting President Donald Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard troops into the Chicago area to act as a security force during the administration’s controversial immigration enforcement action known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The Department of Justice argued in a filing Friday night that Perry’s order “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.”

The 20-page motion asked the higher court to freeze Perry’s order while an appeal is pending, saying the National Guard should be allowed to “protect federal personnel and property” while the litigation continues to play out.

In a response on Saturday, attorneys for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Perry was correct in halting Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to dispatch federalized troops to Chicago with no clearly defined scope of the mission, its duration, or any “provable factual underpinning.”

It was clear, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued, that “absent an injunction, the federal government could and would use the troops consistent with the unbounded scope of the federalization orders — that is, to assist any federal agency on any federal mission that is occurring anywhere in Illinois.”

The dueling motions were a clear indication that the legal battle over Trump’s National Guard plans is far from over.

Perry on Thursday blocked Trump from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

Trump has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as security, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, ”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

(AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday.

Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini.

WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort

The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country.

An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week.

He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE.

“We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation.

At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3.

In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

On Friday, the offices of commissioners Roger Garcia, Christ Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, and Brian Fahey detailed five points as to why they were rejecting the proposal.

""The true humanitarian choice is to not detain mothers, fathers, and workers who have no criminal record,"" said their response.

It went on to say the people who help Nebraska's economy shouldn't be detained if they have no criminal record.

The commissioners cited the Glenn Valley Foods raid in Omaha, saying most who were detained were ""hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here.""

They alleged that detaining those kinds of individuals deepens fear and negatively affects the state's economy.

Their third point is the cost to house someone at the jail, saying it costs about $220 per day, which exceeds the amount ICE is paying at other facilities.

""Real solutions require real reform,"" said the commissioners' response, claiming that what's needed is advocacy at the federal level.

In their final point as to why they were rejecting the proposal, the commissioners said that they do support jailing criminals but must protect those who are contributing to society and ""reflect the values we hold dear, such as faith, hard work, and hope for a better future for their children.""

Video obtained by CBS News Chicago showed agents interrogating and detaining drivers.

One Uber driver from Guatemala said he was eating lunch when agents walked up to him and asked him if he was a U.S. citizen. The driver said he was nervous but rebuffed the agents' request.

Many people arriving at O'Hare this week are coming for Sunday's Chicago Marathon.

Of the 50,000 runners participating in the race, 3,000 are from Mexico – the largest contingent of runners from outside the U.S.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago is among many organizations hosting a cheer zone along the marathon route.

""This year it feels different,"" said Reyna Torres Medivil, the Consul General of Mexico in Chicago.

The agency said it has received calls and emails from runners and their family and friends voicing concerns about ICE enforcement while they're in Chicago. The agency is telling people visiting from Mexico to have copies of documentation on their person.

""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said.","Recent actions by the Trump administration, including deep cuts to international aid and a sweeping immigration crackdown, have drawn sharp criticism from United Nations officials, who warn the U.S. may be violating international law.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, voiced his concerns this week over the U.S. policy of deporting migrants and asylum seekers to countries where they could face harm. He said the administration's approach is inconsistent with international legal principles designed to protect refugees.

""I am worried that the current debate, in Europe for example. and some current deportation practices, such as in the United States, address real challenges in manners not consistent with international law,"" Grandi said on Oct. 7, as reported by The Associated Press.

Grandi also criticized what he described as a growing disregard for international law among developed nations and emphasized that poorer countries continue to carry most of the global refugee burden. Speaking at the opening of UNHCR's executive committee, he urged world leaders not to use politics or nationalism as an excuse to dismantle long-standing protections for displaced people.

""Pressures to reform asylum are not made in good faith, but represent yet another attack on international solidarity, at the time when many countries continue to welcome refugees,"" Grandi said.

Grandi's warning comes as the U.N. refugee agency itself faces major setbacks. As a result of sharp U.S. funding cuts under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed in July, the UNHCR was forced to eliminate nearly 5,000 jobs this year — almost a quarter of its global workforce.

""This was certainly not an easy year for any of us,"" Grandi said.

A pattern of criticism from U.N. officials

This isn't the first time the Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from U.N. officials. In May, Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, raised alarms over the scale and conditions of U.S. deportations.

Türk said his office had received reports from lawyers and families alleging serious human rights violations, including lack of due process, arbitrary detention, and deportations that exposed individuals to torture or other irreparable harm.

""This situation raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both U.S. and international law,"" Türk said.

The U.N.'s warnings come amid a broader ideological clash. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, President Trump delivered a speech denouncing the U.N.'s ""globalist migration agenda,"" and called on countries to close their borders and expel foreigners.

""It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,"" Trump said, according to The Guardian. ""You have to end it now. Your countries are going to hell.""

The administration also claimed the global asylum system has been abused and needs to be overhauled.

In response to the criticism, U.S. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott defended the administration's stance, framing Trump's remarks as a rejection of international pressure.

""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said. He added that Trump's U.N. speech was ""a call to action against the destructive policies promoting mass and illegal migration that globalist bureaucrats have pushed for years.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583820/us-president-donald-trump-speaks-united-nations.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:24.840431

She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.","The Trump administration has attempted to postpone at least nine challenges to its immigration policies during the government shutdown, including cases that could determine whether people can be held in detention centers without bail.

Federal judges have repeatedly said no.

In the detention-without-bail case, Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff said that if the deportation apparatus is still running during the shutdown, an immigration-related challenge should continue too.

“Despite the government shutdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to remove noncitizens from the community; noncitizens continue to be detained under the policy that is challenged in this case; and immigration courts continue to process cases involving detained respondents,” the court’s order states.

“Given that individuals are continuing to be detained subject to the challenged policy, the Court declines to indefinitely stay adjudication of whether such individuals are lawfully detained,” it states.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the class action lawsuit in California against a July 8 policy change ending bond eligibility for people who have lived in the country for years but are in detention centers while their immigration cases continue.

It’s one of at least nine legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Department of Justice has sought to pause during the shutdown, which is now in its second week with no progress toward an end.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

My view is that Trump has been frustrated in the pursuit of his dictatorial ambitions through the use of the ordinary powers of the presidency, including by all of those court orders, and so he has turned to his extraordinary powers. They include improperly pushing his cronies to bring criminal prosecutions of his perceived enemies and deploying the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to crack down on peaceful protest–also wrongly.

These dual policing initiatives represent an outrageous overreach—the besetting sin of dictators, and one that often leads to their ouster. Make no mistake, Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition.

That includes more problems for Trump in litigation, recently recognized by The Atlantic as “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working”. That article reported on the success of my and my colleagues’ democracy litigation–the over 150 legal cases and matters that you Contrarians make possible through your paid subscriptions.

On the legal front, I wrote with Richard Painter and Virginia Canter this week about Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James with unmerited charges that match the similarly baseless indictment last week of James Comey. Team Trump is, in our view, headed for bumpy judicial waters in both cases, and the three of us have already lodged multiple ethics complaints, with more on the way. We also analyzed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and his use of ICE and the legal opposition that has occasioned—including no fewer than three court orders stopping various aspects of Trump’s Chicago activities this week.

Dr But his obstacles are deeper than the courts. As readers of this column know, most backsliding democracies make U-turns. The Trump regime is facing mounting opposition in all of the main dimensions that determine whether autocracy becomes permanently entrenched or whether democracy is poised to make a comeback.

I don’t want to sugarcoat the tremendous damage Trump is doing domestically and internationally and the lives that are being destroyed and even lost as a result. And not every backsliding democracy makes a U-turn. But when you look objectively at the landscape, there are ample reasons to believe Trump is not succeeding in his dictatorial ambitions. That goes well beyond the challenges that he is facing in court.

Trump’s Standing in and at the Polls

A majority of the American people do not like the prosecution of Trump’s adversaries, his deployment of the National Guard, his aggressive immigration processes, his role in shutting down the government to tear health care from millions and the rest of the chaos. No wonder Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.

The results at the polls this year have been similarly devastating. Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections this year. That is a reflection, in part, on Trump’s unpopularity–and augurs ill for the future for Trump’s party.

Public Protest

The size, number, and geographic distribution of protests against the Trump regime in 2025 have been off the charts. We have not seen anything like it in decades.

Now, we will have the second iteration of the No Kings protests on Saturday, Oct. 18. The No Kings protests in June saw a massive coast-to-coast turnout, driven by Trump’s initial National Guard and military deployments in Los Angeles. With Trump’s planned deployments in Portland and Chicago and the deployment in Memphis that started Friday, expect millions of Americans to show up, stand up, and speak out.

Political scientist Erica Chenoweth famously found that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue (Contrarian Editor-in-Chief Jen Rubin argues it would take much less). We are well on our way to that number of peaceful, lawful protesters.

Press Pressure

In this category, I include both old and new media, including independent outlets like The Contrarian. We, of course, saw this coming from Day One and have been outspoken, but, in recent weeks, we have increasingly been joined by traditional media.

That includes perhaps the single most authoritative source in theUnited States, The New York Times, which has broken with its more careful neutrality in recent weeks. A case in point is its banner headline on the James prosecution: “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign.”

Political Leadership

Experts also look at whether there is unified political opposition to a would-be dictator. The strong example initially set by state attorneys general has been followed in recent months by governors stepping up—and now national political leaders are succeeding in doing the same.

In this column last week, I noted that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and national Democrats were winning the shutdown messaging war by making clear that their votes were not available to strip health care from millions of Americans or make it prohibitively expensive. Another week has gone by, and their success has now become evident—recognized in poll after poll and in Republican disarray.

When you add all that up, there is cause for hope. Obviously, it’s too soon to say which path the United States will take and whether we will follow the majority of other democracies that have executed a U-turn following democratic backsliding. Trump and his enablers certainly are not slowing down, and the damage is vast and growing every day.

But if they are not stopping, neither must the friends of democracy—including you, Contrarians. Our rundown of all the week’s stories here at The Contrarian shows that Trump’s “flood the zone” continues to meet “rule of law shock and awe.” See for yourself…

Shutdown & Congress

How long can this last? April Ryan & Paul Osadebe on the true cost of the government shutdown

On a special edition of The Tea, April Ryan sat down with federal worker and organizer Paul Osadebe to talk about the real and worsening harms of the government shutdown. “This is crisis moment, guys.”

Democrats must stay on message with the shutdown

Norman Ornstein examined how congressional Democrats’ undisciplined messaging has hindered their impact in the past — and how the ongoing shutdown offers an opportunity to realign and strengthen their communication strategy. “When the shutdown ends, the responsibility for the healthcare catastrophe will be clear.”

Is Trump’s Overreach Starting to Fail? Senator Mark Warner with Jen Rubin

Sen. Mark Warner joined Jen to unpack the latest on the MAGA government shutdown, Trump’s notice of “armed conflict” to Congress, and the constitutional strength of our military. “The briefings we’ve got from the administration so far are not satisfying.”

Militarization, ICE and Chicago

We Found the ‘Enemy from Within’

Jen Rubin unpacked the unchecked cruelty of Trump’s troop deployments and ICE overreach, which prove daily that the “enemy within” is him and his lackeys. “ICE’s raid on a Chicago apartment building and the ensuing ICE violence against civilians make clear that Trump has initiated an unconstitutional, brutal war against ordinary Americans.”

Trump’s Fundamentally Anti-Democratic Immigration Strategy

On the Contrarian Podcast this week, Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.) and immigration expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick explained why Stephen Miller and ICE are doing anything but making Americans safer.

Dispatch from Chicago: This is not a ‘war zone’

Lorraine Forte shared her time with a local activist in Chicago fighting to restore her city after last week’s shocking military-style apartment raid and offered a look at the mood on the ground as the city braces for a National Guard deployment. “The city is still reeling.”

The Contrarian covers the Democracy Movement

This week we saw courageous, resilient, mad-as-hell anti-ICE protests in Chicago, Portland and more. Nationwide protests are planned for next Saturday, Oct. 18; find one near you here.

The Global View

Jen Rubin and Ilan Goldenberg on the Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal

Ilan Goldenberg joined Jen Rubin on Thursday for a live discussion of the Gaza ceasefire deal—what’s in it, what’s not in it, and what’s likely to unfold next, along with the case for optimism. “Now is an opportunity.”

The UN and the Peril of Passivity

Roberto Valadéz wrote on the existential crossroads faced by the United Nations as the Trump administration demeans and defunds its vital work. Part of the way forward, he argued, is a stronger PR strategy. “The United Nations is not a failed project; it is an unfinished one.”

The Nobel Prize is about character, not headlines

Brian O’Neill analyzed Trump’s Peace Prize fixation, which reveals far more about him than about peace, and put forward far more deserving (and likely) candidates for this year’s honor. “Facts matter. So do deliverables.”

The Movie Iran Doesn’t Want You to See

Culture columnist Meredith Blake wrote on Jafar Panahi’s It Was Just an Accident, a film inspired by Panahi’s experiences as a political prisoner that began as secret iPhone footage and has since won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. “With the movie arriving stateside next week and the Iranian regime no doubt closely monitoring its reception overseas, we can only hope the acclaim becomes truly deafening.”

Will the ceasefire hold? Steven Cook on the feasibility of the Hamas-Israel peace deal

Middle East expert Steven Cook joins Jen to discuss the hopeful end of hostilities in a region that hasn’t seen peace in decades. Who knew it would take a transactional, American bully like Trump to convince Netanyahu to finally accept a deal?

Behind the Curtain

The REAL state of the economy & America’s future as an economic powerhouse with Justin Wolfers

Justin Wolfers joined Jen for a must-watch breakdown of the actual health of the economy under Trump—something the administration is doing its best to obfuscate. “We are flying blind right now.”

Trump’s blueprint for tyranny

Austin Sarat analyzed Trump’s “Compact for Excellence in Higher Education” as a blatant attempt to further control universities across the country—and a precedent for further attacks on freedoms far outside academia. “Think what I think. Do what I do. Or, else.”

DOJ & SCOTUS

Cold comfort: The DOJ says it stands with survivors, but words aren’t enough

Jacqueline Kelly and Mimi Rocah wrote on the DOJ’s hollow commitments to anti-trafficking efforts and victims of sexual crimes. By prioritizing political interests over justice, they argued, the Justice Department is jeopardizing the work of law enforcement to protect survivors.

If this isn’t vindictive prosecution, what is? Andrew Weissmann on James Comey criminal charges

Andrew Weissmann joined Jen to break down James Comey’s specious indictment, what his defense team may be planning, and Pam Bondi’s bizarre behavior. “This could blow up.”

Can our courts be reformed?

Lisa Graves, author of Without Precedent, joined Jen for an exposé on Chief Justice Roberts’ Supreme Court and its impact on law, policy, and democracy at large. “If you view this as a hyper-partisan court engaged in hyper-partisan activity for a hyper-partisan president, that’s what’s happening.”

Cartoons & Fun Stuff

This week, our cartoonists took on “the enemy within” (Cold as ICE by Michael de Adder, Standing ground by Nick Anderson), the nihilistic chaos of Republican leadership (Driving blind

by Calder Robinson, All on board by Michael de Adder, The Reaper by RJ Matson), and the AG who sadly isn’t Elle Woods (Legally Bondi by RJ Matson).

Cinnamon Nut Roll Coffee Cake

Jamie Schler graced us with an object lesson in pastry baking. Her cinnamon nut roll coffee cake teaches us a lesson in perseverance, and how to overcome exhaustion, frustration, and despair. With time, order and organization, precision and persistence, we can—and will—finally succeed.

Dolly Parton ‘ain’t dead yet,’ and a weary nation breathes a sigh of relief

Despite rumors to the contrary, Dolly Parton is still alive. As Meredith Blake wrote, the country music icon may be the last thing we can all agree on.

Contrarian Pet of the Week

This week’s pet of the week is the lovely Fettuccine! Fettuccine is a 6-year-old Flame point Siamese who had a proclivity towards WWE fighting her brother, napping on fresh, clean laundry, and begging for wet food like it’s her birthday every day.

are you aware of anyone in US govt saying it's against US interest for aliens to be sent to costa rica?
obj - sustained R: anything stopping DHS/ICE from asking Costa Rica whether they'd take Abrego prior to ... /107 ... criminal trial?","Liveblog

At 11am I will try to live-blog, for @lawfaremedia.org , the hearing in Abrego Garcia’s civil (habeas corpus) case in federal court in Greenbelt MD. Abrego is seeking release from detention under a SCOTUS precedent called Zadvydas v Davis (2001). ... /1 tile.loc.gov

Meanwhile, in Abrego’s criminal case, a status conference is due to start at 9am CT/10am ET in Nashville TN over what sort of discovery to provide Abrego in pursuing his motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution. Unfortunately, we can't get someone there today. ... /2

Here in Greenbelt, we do not yet know if we'll hear live testimony or just oral argument. To keep Abrego detained, govt must show that Abrego faces a “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Here’s Judge Xinis’ order convening the hearing: /3

The Zadvydas issue involves these statutes, plus due process principles. Immigration laws (8 USC 1231a1 & a2) say an alien shall be detained for 90 days after his order of removal (“removal period”), & 1236a6 says that period can be extended in some cases. But ... /4

... in Zadvydas, SCOTUS held that there was a rebuttable presumption that the alien should be detained no more than 6 mos. The key is whether govt can show “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future. ... /5

... Abrego’s situation is a bit different. His order of removal was back in 2019 but he was released because he won “withholding of removal.” He was only re-arrested in March 2025. His attys say his 6-mos Zadvydas period” expired in early 2020. ... /6

... They argue basically (1) govt can’t show its really taking steps to remove him in the “reasonably foreseeable future” (in part because they’re keeping him for criminal trial) & (2) it could’ve taken steps to remove him during the 5 years he was free. ... /7

Though Abrego's attys were notified that govt planned to remove him to Eswatini (after 1st saying Uganda), at the last hearing govt attys could not even say whether Eswatini had yet been contacted. Today govt can present evidence of concrete steps its taken or is about to take. ... /8

There have also been recent reports that DHS notified his attys that now he'd be sent to Ghana, but that notice seems to have been rescinded. Doubtless we'll get the most up-to-date info shortly. ... /9 abcnews.go.com abcnews.go.com

DHS says notice about deporting Abrego Garcia to Ghana was 'premature' Looks like DOJ has brought at least one witness today, so we'll likely get testimony. /10

Plaintiffs attorneys at counsel table are Andrew Rossman, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Sascha Rand, Jonathan Cooper, & Olivia Horton. All are from the Quinn Emanuel firm excerpt Sandoval-Moshenberg, who's an immigration specialist who was Abrego's first lawyer after his 2025 arrest. /11

For DOJ I see Bridget O'Hickey (counsel to the Asst AG), Ernesto Molina, Jr. (deputy director of office of immigration litigation), and, I think, 2 others, but I can't yet ID them. /12

I suspect one of the other DOJ attys is Jonathan Guynn, who was here last time and whose name I misspelled then. (Regret the error.) He's a deputy assistant AG. (Molina is a career guy.) /13

Now getting warnings about electronic devices. (I'm in the media room.) /14

All rise. US District Judge Paula Xinis is on the bench. Attys giving appearances. Lead Abrego atty today: Andrew Rossman Lead DOJ: Jonathan Guynn. The DOJ atty I couldn't ID is Drew Ensign. /15

There's one other Abrego atty present i didn't mention before: Rina Gandhi. Govt witness is apparently John Schultz of DHS. Judge is speaking at sidebar (at the bench) with one lawyer from each side, apparently about how to conduct the hearing today. /16

Guynn & Rossman are the attys at the bench. /17

J: to be clear, that's basis for your [answer]? S: yes, ma'am. G: has ICE previously removed aliens to eswatini under that memo? S: yes. G: has Eswatini agreed to receive Abrego under this memo objection-foundation G: have you communicated with ICE about abrego's case? S: i have /33

S: spoke to Mursky about Eswatini 2 days ago. Wednesday morning about the immediate case right now ... they had not pursued further discussion J: you spoke to anderson this morning? /36

[sorry lost some frames important frames in there] He said discussions were ongoing but Eswatini had not yet agreed to receive Abrego, even if injunction was lifted.] /37

S: if injunction is dissolved, we will remove him to eswatini. G: what's your understanding of state's attempts to find additional host countries if plan to remove him to eswatini does not receive. S: also in discussions with Ghana. /38

G: has US ID'd Ghana as country he'll be sent to S: not at this time. a notice was prematurely sent to him. G: why? S: field office just trying to get ahead of things so if ghana did say yes removal would be quicker. G: if court dissolved injunction , how long would it take to remove him /39

objection--foundation G: do you have experience finding alternate 3d countries to remove aliens? S: [didn't underestand answer] haven't been involved where first 3d country fell through. ICE asks State for assistance. If country A says no, they pivot to B, i don't have visibility on country A /40

G: if court dissolved injunction, how confidetn arew you ICE could remove him to a 3d country in next 2 or 3 weeiks. S: confident we could remove him quickly. within 72 hours. Judge asks counsel to bench again. /41

[Sorry, I dont know what happened with a fairly crucial frame above. But Guynn seemed a little surprised that Schultz could not say that Eswatini would accept Abrego if the injunction was lifted. At Judge had taken over the questioning at that point. Guynn tried to interrupt, but in vain.] /42

While bench conference proceeds, this is what @joshgerstein.bsky.social heard: /43

Houston: Missing teen in immigration custody

The backstory:

The teen was reported missing after he was last seen Saturday afternoon near the intersection of Clay Road and Hempstead Road in Spring Branch.

FIEL, an immigrant-led civil rights organization, helped the boy's family put out a call for help during a press conference on Friday.

According to the organization, the teen was selling fruit with his mother and sister on Saturday when he asked to go to the restroom. His mom was reportedly busy tending to a customer at the time, and when she turned back around, he was gone.

After trying to find her son, his mom called Houston police and filed a missing person report.

Hours after the press conference on Friday, Houston Police confirmed with FOX 26 that the teen had been found safe and his family had been contacted.

FOX 26 later learned from FIEL that a law enforcement agency found the teen, and he had been in ICE custody at a Houston-area detention center since Monday. He is reportedly OK.

The family is undocumented. They are working to get him out of custody.

Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s hardline immigrant agenda is upending that protection.
So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program.
There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.
Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.","The Trump administration has once again put Dreamers on a rollercoaster ride.

The federal government is sending mixed signals about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a popular program devised under Barack Obama that had until recently allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to live and work legally without serious risk of deportation.

On one hand, in a new court filing, the federal government suggested it may eventually resume official consideration of initial Daca applications for the first time in years, which could let tens of thousands of people finally have their petitions processed.

On the other, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that immigrants who say they are under the Daca umbrella “are not automatically protected from deportations”, as the program “does not confer any form of legal status in this country”.

Such an approach has been used by Trump officials to justify detaining about 20 known Daca recipients during the new administration so far – despite no White House or DHS memo, regulation or executive order revealing a policy change.

“We started hearing from those detained that when they tell Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents that they have Daca, the Ice agents say: ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter any more’,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant youth organization United We Dream.

Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s hardline immigrant agenda is upending that protection.

Who are dreamers?

“Dreamers” is a nickname for immigrants brought stateside as children, who do not have legal status. One estimate counts almost 2.5 million Dreamers in the US.

The moniker refers to the Dream Act, proposed legislation that has been deliberated for decades in an attempt to offer Dreamers a pathway to legal immigration status. Lawmakers have introduced at least 20 iterations of the bill, but despite bipartisan support, no version has cleared both chambers of Congress.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program. There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.

Daca recipients’ average age is 31 years old. California and Texas host the largest Daca populations by far, with 147,440 and 87,890 respectively.

In 2023, more than nine out of 10 Daca recipients who were surveyed by national immigrant-focused organizations were either employed or in school. They reported that having Daca protections had made it possible for them to find jobs that paid better, work in fields that reflected their education and long-term career goals, get professional licenses and reach economic independence. The program had also opened the door for some beneficiaries to buy homes and cars.

What is Daca?

The Daca policy debuted on 15 June 2012 to address Dreamers’ need to work legally and be “lawfully present” in the US rather than hide from immigration enforcement and work under the table. To qualify, an applicant must have come to the country before they were 15 years old, have been aged 30 or younger on the date the Obama administration announced the program and have resided in the US since June 2007, among other requirements.

Daca access is barred for anyone convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors.

Although the program has been a lifeline for many undocumented youth, it’s not a legal status or pathway to citizenship, and the antiquated cutoff dates for eligibility have made it so that Dreamers in high school now are less likely to qualify. At the same time, protracted litigation has long paused the processing of initial Daca applications.

“I think it’s really important to understand how tragic it is that young people who are Americans in every sense but lack one piece of paper here not only aren’t getting a pathway to citizenship, but aren’t even getting these very basic and temporary deportation protections and work authorizations,” said Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group FWD.us.

Why Congress hasn’t done anything to provide more stability for Dreamers is the “billion-dollar question”, said Diana Pliego, senior strategist for campaigns at the National Immigration Law Center – especially, she added, when more than 80% of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for them, and when it’s estimated that providing that would add about $800bn in US gross domestic product growth over a 10-year period.

Where does the program stand now?

Earlier this year, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in practice that Daca and work permit adjudications should restart as normal everywhere except Texas, where officials successfully argued the state was negatively affected by Daca recipients because of education and healthcare costs.

The window has closed for appeals to the US supreme court, at least for the time being. Now, a district court will eventually decide how to implement the fifth circuit’s ruling, and in a recent court filing, the Trump administration outlined its vision for complying, in part through restarting initial adjudications of Daca petitions.

Yet, simultaneously, the Trump administration said those proposals would “not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to Daca”, and for now, the status quo prevails.

“This administration can do many things. So we’re just worried about creating an expectation or false hope for people with initial applications,” said Macedo do Nascimento.

Trump tried to phase out Daca during his first administration but was ultimately stopped by the supreme court.

What about Dreamers in Texas?

Though they are likely to still receive deportation protections, there’s a risk that Texas Dreamers may lose both their work permits and their “lawful presence” designation, which would affect their economic prospects and could have larger immigration consequences.

Who is being detained?

Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.

Evenezer Cortez Martínez – who came to the US when he was four years old and had a valid Daca permit through October 2026 – was deported to Mexico in March. He was eventually allowed to return to his wife and children in Kansas City, though he said: “I still have that doubt about whether it’s really true that I’m [back] here.”

Similarly, in August, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira was targeted in El Paso, Texas, in front of his children, his arm being dislocated during the chaos, before he was detained in New Mexico. DHS called him a “criminal illegal alien” because of a decade-old charge for marijuana possession as a teenager that was later reduced to disorderly conduct, and that had never stopped the agency from renewing his Daca protections.

Cortez Martínez and Gamez Lira are two of 20 or so known Daca recipients who have been arrested, detained or deported this year.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, has encouraged Daca recipients to consider voluntary deportation.

To Pliego, that would be a loss for the US.

“These are people who have built their lives here, who, you know, have been here since they were young kids,” she said. “This is their home. And so we’re losing longstanding community members who are contributing to the country, who are giving back in a lot of ways.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fbac16aee1df1683a89d7b938ea41016bd34ce/539_0_3708_2967/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dbf1abcf46db58aa4a63e88fa1f5ba4",N,,2025-10-11 12:57:56.023080

As the Supreme Court has long held, no court or executive agency can invent citizenship outside those bounds.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not confer citizenship on the children of illegal aliens, and Congress has never granted it by statute.
AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.
U.S. citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and the touchstone is total allegiance to the United States, not mere location or subjection to its laws.","America First Legal (AFL), in partnership with Boyden Gray LLC, has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of eighteen members of the House Judiciary Committee—led by Chairman Jim Jordan—urging the Court to defend the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the limits it places on U.S. citizenship.

AFL’s brief argues that allegiance is a reciprocal bond requiring loyalty from the individual and consent from the sovereign. When that consent is broken, citizenship cannot be claimed. The Fourteenth Amendment enshrines this principle, granting citizenship only to those born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction—meaning total, exclusive allegiance and lawful presence, not mere location.

The Framers said it plainly: the Citizenship Clause does not include “aliens or anyone owing allegiance to a foreign sovereignty.” Courts and scholars ever since have agreed. Citizenship is not automatic, nor is it a right: it is earned through allegiance, consent, and law.

AFL’s brief emphasizes that there is also widespread agreement that children born in the United States to foreign ambassadors or invading soldiers are not U.S. citizens—not because those parents have immunity, but because they owe allegiance elsewhere. The same principle applies to children of aliens unlawfully present in the country: their parents owe allegiance to another nation and are here without the consent of the United States. This is not a question of compassion, but of constitutional order. Citizenship cannot be born of defiance, and allegiance cannot exist without consent.

AFL’s brief further makes clear that only Congress may confer citizenship. As the Supreme Court has long held, no court or executive agency can invent citizenship outside those bounds. The Fourteenth Amendment does not confer citizenship on the children of illegal aliens, and Congress has never granted it by statute. Thus, it may not be conferred upon the children of aliens, regardless of birthplace.

“Our history and tradition stand for the proposition that citizenship depends upon a public determination of allegiance. Being subject to the country’s jurisdiction is not a default presumption. Instead, citizenship is a duty, a bond, and a privilege reserved for those who are subject to our laws and our sovereignty into an entitlement,” said Dan Epstein, Vice President of America First Legal.

AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car.
You’ll see in the video, the WGN [employee] wasn’t Black or brown … they are terrorizing anyone.","An employee of WGN-TV was detained by two Border Patrol officers and later released after federal agents swarmed a busy intersection in Chicago Friday morning.

WGN is not naming the employee, who works in the station’s creative services department, as station policy requires blurring faces and not identifying those who have not been charged with a crime.

Witnesses on site who captured the incident on video spoke to WGN, a local news station owned by Nexstar Media, about the moments leading up to the staffer’s detainment.

“I heard yelling and screaming and honking. I ran downstairs to see what was going on. It looked like Border Patrol agents in a minivan had slammed some lady to the ground. And so, I ran up to her and asked her for her name. She said she was a WGN employee,” said Josh Thomas, a witness who lives in a condo above the scene in the city’s Lincoln Square neighborhood.

Thomas added that when he made his way down to the scene, around 8:30 a.m., he realized there was another person already detained inside the minivan being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

“I didn’t get his name, although I asked for his name,” Thomas said. “He didn’t speak very good English. They claimed that the WGN employee was obstructing justice, even though she was, like all of us, just standing there, taking video.”

Giordana Mahn told WGN-TV that she was in a cab on her way to the airport when she, too, captured the scene.

“She was walking east. We were driving west, and that’s when I took out my phone. They had just, like, tackled her and brought her into the street. That’s when I asked her, ‘What’s your name?'” Mahn said.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car. She was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer, but was later released without charges, according to WGN-TV.

In an area with condos, apartments, and concerned neighbors, Thomas called Friday’s scene heartbreaking.

“It’s terrifying for the community. When I came back upstairs to my condo, my son was crying and asked me what was happening and if people were going to come take him,” Thomas said.

Mahn shared his sentiments, lamenting her fear for the community.

Just days before the raid, Mayor Karen Bass hailed a 9th circuit ruling upholding the temporary restraining order against ICE as “a great day for Los Angeles” and said that she hoped fear among immigrant communities in our city would subside.

It didn’t feel like a great day for Los Angeles when we looked down the barrels of guns pointed at us by federal agents in our workplace.

While my coworkers and I were held at gunpoint, I felt fear and rage, but not surprise. This was the 6th time ICE raided the Van Nuys Community Job Center in under three months. Just three hours earlier, my staff witnessed the same Border Patrol agents kidnap seven day laborers from the parking lot in front of the center. Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.

Without the restraining order, things will only get worse. Our entire city is on edge now that ICE is receiving billions more in funding to kidnap and disappear our immigrant neighbors, thanks to congress. ICE’s budget for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1st, is a whopping $18.7 billion.

ICE’s campaign of terror in Los Angeles escalated in June when federal agents in unmarked vehicles stormed the parking lot of the Hollywood Home Depot and surrounding sidewalks, and violently kidnapped 30 day laborers. When people rose up in response to demand ICE vacate the city, they were met with National Guard deployments, ordered by President Donald Trump.

That morning, I started receiving frantic calls from families on the ground, and later, others looking for their loved ones. Many of the people disappeared by ICE were our members. We were able to track down nearly all of those kidnapped — now being held in San Diego detention centers. ICE’s operation was indiscriminate in regard to immigration status: among those kidnapped was a U.S. citizen, later released, and a person with an active asylum case.

These kidnappings were not a one-off horror, but a terrifying new normal driven by the federal government’s white supremacist strategy to erase communities of color. ICE is racially profiling and hunting down people in our streets, making immigrants across our city afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or take their kids to school.

We need political leaders across the nation to act boldly and use the full power of their offices to throw sand in ICE’s gears — introduce legislation, continue to file lawsuits, and call these actions what they are: kidnappings driven by racial profiling. Our city and state leadership must put state resources behind protecting immigrant communities.

Mayor Bass has not been a model of solidarity. In January, she proposed cutting day labor centers completely out of the city’s budget, despite knowing that President Trump specifically named jornaleros as targets and that day laborers were doing dangerous cleanup work during the widely reported on fires that devastated our city. Our funding was only restored because we mobilized and fought back.

The city still isn’t doing enough to protect day labor centers. We call on Mayor Bass and LA elected officials to speak out against ICE’s targeting of day laborers and the worker centers that serve them, and to stand by their promise to protect all Angelenos. It’s time for city and state officials to get creative and use every legal avenue at their disposal.

In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed laws banning ICE from entering schools or hospitals without a warrant.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order banning ICE from operating on any property owned or controlled by the city.

Mayor Bass should follow Governor Newsom and Mayor Johnson’s lead and ban ICE from all city-contracted facilities like our day labor centers.

While we hold our elected leaders to account, we’re not waiting on them to protect and defend our communities. For over 30 years, we’ve built a network of worker and community centers across Los Angeles that builds power and functions as a safety net for our people. Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.

Over the decades, the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California has fought for the dignity and rights of day laborers and domestic workers by providing direct services and mobilizing for campaigns, such as improved minimum wage standards and enforcement, worker safety, and immigrant rights. We’ve raised awareness about the health hazards that day laborers and domestic workers face from wildfires and the frontline role they’ve played in wildfire recovery, and we provide wildfire safety resources as we fight for better protections.

The Institute of Popular Education of Southern California continues to track down workers detained by ICE, bring people their medications, reconnect families, and deliver groceries and other essential aid to impacted communities.

Across Los Angeles, many community members are responding in creative ways — building community defense centers, protesting outside hotels where ICE agents are staying so they can’t sleep, and growing mutual aid networks. But we need more people to be involved.

These raids are not just a threat to undocumented people. Everyone is at risk as this racist and fascist regime uses its power to sow chaos and terrorize our families, friends, and neighbors.

The way we stop them is by growing our community power. If you see unmarked vans or suspect ICE presence, report it to a trusted immigrant rights group. Join or support a local rapid response network. Donate to mutual aid efforts and funds for those in detention. Check in and share resources with your neighbors. Refuse to let kidnapping become normal.

From what we see unfolding in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, it’s clear that Los Angeles was a test site for a larger project of racial terror and ultimately ethnic cleansing. This will continue until we all rise, in all the ways we can, to stop it.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2232619972-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:30.042028

One day following the ruling, protests continued outside the facility as state police kept watch outside the gates. Notably absent was the National Guard, which had been patrolling just 24 hours earlier.

“We will protect the safety of all of our communities and the safety of all of our community members, and they do not feel safe right now,"" said protester Casey Caballero.

Illinois State police in riot gear clashed with an unruly crowd near the ICE facility in Broadview as protests continue to rage in Chicago in the wake of Trump’s illegal immigration crackdown, WLS reported.

Protestors chanted “the whole world is watching” as baton-wielding officers scuffled with the pushy group, video circulating online showed.

Photos and video showed at least four people being roughly dragged from the crowd by their clothes and bags and later handcuffed and led away by Illinois State Police officers.

Those who were arrested have been charged with resisting and obstruction, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said, according to WLS.

Demonstrations have raged across the Second City since Trump initiated “Operation Midway Blitz” — a push to crackdown on illegal immigration across the city which has been resisted by local leaders and protesters.

Trump sent several hundred National Guard soldiers to protect DHS agents as they carry out deportations in Chicago — but on Thursday, Biden-appointed District Judge April Perry granted Illinois’ request for a temporary restraining order to block the National Guard deployment.

Friday’s demonstration came a day after protesters Ray Collins and Jocelyn Robledo — who were carrying loaded weapons when they clashed with ICE officers outside the same Broadview ICE facility on Sept. 27 — had their felony charges dropped after a local grand jury refused to indict them.

At another scene in Lincoln Square on Friday, a video editor for local WGN-TV, Debbie Brockman, was detained by ICE officers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

When they checked in a few days later, ICE detained them again, and on Friday, his father was deported, the Marine told NBC 7.

Steve Rios of Oceanside said he enlisted because of his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez. He said they came to the U.S. from Mexico more than 30 years ago and have washed cars and cleaned houses from sun-up to sundown for his whole life.

“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Steve said. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in. I don't think amounts to what they've done.”

Steve and his parents were headed to pick up his younger sister Ashley Rios and her husband, who’s also a Marine, at Camp Pendleton on Sept. 28. They’ve done that every weekend for the past few months because she’s expecting her first child.

But Steve said this last time, they were stopped at the gate, and ICE agents arrived, detaining both his parents. Their family says they have no criminal history, as well as pending green card applications – sponsored by Steve – and work visas as they wait for approval.

“It was scary,” Steve said. “It was scary because my whole life, I've kind of just, it's been in the back of my head.”

“My brother texted me that they got stopped. And as soon as I heard that, I just started, like, bawling,” said Ashley, who was waiting for them with her husband, looking forward to eating French toast together. “He asked what was wrong, and I said that my parents were getting taken.”

Their parents were taken downtown and Steve said he was able to pick them up a few hours later, with ankle monitors, and bring them home. They were told to check in with ICE downtown on Thursday, Steve said, so he went with them, and they waited for several hours before learning they would be detained again.

“I just kept on looking at my parents. I didn't know if it would be the last time I'd see them,” Steve said.

ICE agents led his parents away as his father wore a red shirt and white hat that both said “Proud dad of a U.S. Marine,"" an outfit he picked out with intention for the check-in.

“He said, 'Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we'll be fine,'"" Steve said.

Steve said Friday morning, he talked briefly by phone with his dad, who told him they were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court, but they were told they will be moved to the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

When asked why the couple was detained, a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement, “As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” the statement continued.

“It's just hard because you just want to hear, like, your parents voice, that everything will be OK,” Ashley said, adding that she was nervous, especially thinking about her pregnancy. “I'd always want, like, my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it's just hard to not think about your parents there.”

Steve and Ashley said they weren’t told why their parents were detained and aren’t sure what will happen next, but they both have faith.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Steve said. “The only person that knows is up there.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/marine-parents-detained.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:57.891042

Members of the Georgia Detention Watch could count on Guevara to cover demonstrations in front of the ICE headquarters denouncing the conditions at Stewart Detention Center. He would report on the crowds brought to city and county meetings by the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights opposing the implementation of 287(g) agreements that turned local police into ICE agents.

Guevara’s on-the-ground reporting won him Emmy awards and an extensive network of community contacts that provided him with on-the-spot information about ICE activities. On June 14 Guevara — wearing a bright red T-shirt and his big black vest with PRESS emblazoned on it — went to a “No Kings” protest in Dekalb County, just north of the Atlanta city limits. The crowd was amassed on the sidewalk, so Mario with his video camera walked along the edge of the street to film the signs.

He was jumped by police who ignored his statement that he was with the press and charged him with three misdemeanors, including obstruction and unlawful assembly. Although those charges were dropped, ICE agents showed up at the jail and placed him in removal proceedings.

ICE fought every legal effort by Guevara’s lawyers to release him from the Folkston ICE Processing Center, a GEO Group facility located 247 miles from Atlanta near the Florida border. He was held there for over 100 days until he was transported to Louisiana and then put on a plane to El Salvador.

Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01].","Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Tchelly Moise was expecting this call. Ted Genoways:Hey, Tchelly, it’s Ted Genoways. Tchelly Moise:Hey, man, how’s it going? Al Letson:Ted is a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting Network and he’s been trying to reach Tchelly for almost 24 hours, ever since he heard the news out of the Trump administration. Tchelly Moise:I can tell you honestly this is the first time I feel like this is really happening for real. Al Letson:Tchelly is Haitian and has what’s called temporary protected status or TPS. It gives Tchelly the right to live and work in the US legally because Haiti is considered too dangerous to go back to. But on February 20th, all of that changed. Speaker 4:Now, despite the ongoing violence in their home country, the Trump administration is canceling an extension of temporary protected status for half-a-million Haitians. Al Letson:Haiti has been in turmoil for centuries. It suffered through colonialism, harsh dictators, natural disasters, including a devastating earthquake in 2010 that it never fully recovered from. Food and water is still scarce, and over the last several years more than 15,000 people have been killed in gang violence. It’s led many Haitians to flee the country. Tchelly was one of them. He nearly died after being shot in the chest during a robbery. The situation in Haiti felt dire. Tchelly Moise:I was thinking, “Maybe because they know what is going on in Haiti, it’s logically possible to just cancel TPS for the Haitians.” Al Letson:Tchelly says he doesn’t know anyone who is planning to leave the country, at least not willingly. Tchelly Moise:I don’t think no one is going to get on a plane and say, “Hey, I’m going back home.” I don’t think this is going to happen. I think people are going to try everything but leaving this country unless they get arrested by ICE. Al Letson:Tchelly knows a lot of Haitians. That’s because he’s a union representative for workers at one of the largest meat packing plants in the country. It’s owned by JBS, the largest meat producer in the world. At one point not so long ago, the union says the plant in Greeley employed more than 1200 Haitian migrants, just over a third of the workforce. The company has been accused of trafficking these workers, luring them in with the promise of good jobs and a place to live. Instead, the work was dangerous and the living conditions harsh. Speaker 4:Immigrants at a meat packing plant in Greeley say they were victims of a bait-and-switch scheme. Al Letson:Tchelly says he saw firsthand how people were being treated. It’s why he left JBS and started working at the union that represents the workers, to try and fight back and improve conditions. And they had made some gains, bringing national attention to the situation and forcing the company to respond. But now, after going through all of that, the workers are among the more than 300,000 Haitians who could be forced out of the US. Tchelly Moise:We’re talking about Haitians that have had TPS since 2010. Al Letson:We first told you about these Haitian workers back in February when President Trump had just taken office for his second term. And so much has changed since then that we decided to revisit that episode and update you about what’s happened since. To start, Ted Genoways of the Food and Environment Reporting Network reminds us how these people ended up working at a meat packing plant in the first place. Ted Genoways:It all started with a TikTok video. Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:03:32]. I said good news for good news because I had assurance when you’re coming, you’re going to have a job. Ted Genoways:The man in the video is Mackenson Remy. Mackenson is originally from Haiti. He’s in his 30s with braided hair and a thin beard. He’s been living in the US for almost a decade now and moved to Colorado in 2023. At that time, he began making TikTok videos about job openings in the area for his few followers, mostly other Haitians. None of them got that much attention until this one. The video opens with Mackenson driving through the parking lot of a huge meat packing plant, speaking in his native Creole. There are industrial truck beds, people wearing hard hats and reflective vests, and a giant red and white logo on the side of the building reads “JBS.” Mackenson Remy:That job, they pay good. [foreign language 00:04:28]. They pay like $22 and $23 an hour. Ted Genoways:Meat packing work is hard and Mackenson makes it clear in the video. He tells his followers, “This isn’t a job for lazy people or people who don’t like the cold.” Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:04:50]. Ted Genoways:He adds, “Speaking English is not a job requirement.” If his followers come, Mackenson says he even knows a place for them to stay. So if you’re interested. Mackenson Remy:I say, you can text me, tell me when you want to come because I already know if you came, you can have a job. Ted Genoways:Mackenson posted the video that night and when he woke up the next morning … Mackenson Remy:The video has been viral. Ted Genoways:It had gone viral. Less than a year after posting that video, Tchelly’s union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7, would issue a formal complaint to the government, accusing Mackenson and JBS of human trafficking. I’ve found that to keep its profits high, JBS has a track record of recruiting new immigrants who are desperate for work in the United States. And over the last 20 years, the company has been the subject of more than 100 lawsuits, EEOC complaints, and government investigations over its working conditions. Mackenson says he didn’t know very much about JBS when he made the TikTok video. Everything he shared with his followers, he says he learned from Edmond Ebah. Edmond Ebah:My name is Edmond Ebah. I’m from Benin, West Africa. I work at JBS Plant in Greeley in Colorado. Ted Genoways:This is a promo video of Edmond posted to the JBS Facebook page. Edmond Ebah:There is nothing I can say make my world hard because I’m happy to do what I’m doing. Ted Genoways:Lots of soft focus and slow motion, it cuts from scene to scene. Edmond driving a van, Edmond walking through the plant, Edmond making coffee. Then it ends with Edmond sitting in an office. Edmond Ebah:I applied to HR because I speak seven language and I can help people come to work for JBS. Ted Genoways:The video fades to white, text appears saying, quote, “Edmond has helped more than 30 people find a new life path with JBS USA.” Now, speaking seven languages is never not an asset for any job, but it’s especially useful at JBS because nearly all the people Edmond has hired are immigrants. There are over 3000 employees working at the plant in Greeley and the union representing those employees says between 80 and 90 percent are immigrants. JBS is hardly unique. Nationally, the meat packing industry is overwhelmingly dependent on immigrant labor. But Mackenson didn’t know this. He says he was even a little surprised when he first met Edmond. Mackenson Remy:When I meet him, it’s like I think he’s a white guy. He’s like, “Oh, you look like my people.” He say, “Yeah, I’m from Benin.” I say, “Oh, nice, I’m from Haiti.” Ted Genoways:Mackenson met Edmond the same day he made the video, and Edmond told him they had 60 jobs on the line available. Jobs slaughtering, butchering, and packaging the meat. He’s also the one who told Mackenson about the pay, the benefits, and the fact that workers didn’t need to speak English. Mackenson’s other videos on TikTok got maybe a few dozen views at most. The one he posted about the JBS job had 35,000 views the next day. And the messages started pouring in. This was way more people than expected and there are only 60 positions available. So he texts Edmond. Mackenson Remy:I sent the screenshot for him to show him how many people watched the video. Ted Genoways:But he says Edmond didn’t seem at all phased. He just gave Mackenson a new number of available positions. Mackenson Remy:He said even 100 or 200 people, he can help them out. Ted Genoways:This surprised Mackenson, but it doesn’t surprise me. Turnover in the meat packing industry is incredibly high, an estimated 40% each year. That’s because the work is grueling and extremely dangerous. That’s been the case since the earliest days of industrial meat packing at the turn of the 20th Century. People burn out and are injured all the time. But the Haitians who responded to Mackenson needed work and were enticed by the high pay. Plus, Mackenson had said he could help them find a place to stay, but he’d never expected this kind of response. Mackenson Remy:I just scared because when I see a lot of people text me and I didn’t know where they going to live. Ted Genoways:Soon, he gets a text from Edmond, promising that the new hires will be staying at a motel near the plant for two weeks free of charge. Mackenson Remy:So then after I remember, he called me. He say, “Hey, listen, we got a place for them. Don’t worry, let them come. Let them come.” Ted Genoways:And so they came. Mackenson Remy:Hey, my boss, I’m with the guy. I’m waiting for the other one, I’m at the airport right now. Ted Genoways:This is a voice memo Mackenson sent to Edmond from the Denver airport. It was December 2023, and he was picking up some of the first Haitians to arrive. Mackenson Remy:Boss, you see the last guy I sent it to, this is him ticket, he’s already booked the ticket. Ted Genoways:Edmond directed him to bring everyone to a place called the Rainbow Motel. It sits right off a highway about a mile from the JBS plant. Much like other budget motels, there’s not much to it. Tiny rooms, mismatched furniture, some plastic chairs out front. No pool, but there is a fenced-off square of AstroTurf. And yes, there is a neon rainbow on the roof. There were dozens of Haitians who came to Greeley that first month and Mackenson quickly became their point person for almost everything. Mackenson says he would sometimes stick around Greeley for a few days to drive people, to get anything they needed. Food from Walmart, coats from Goodwill. It was becoming a lot. Mackenson Remy:Boss, this work is hard for me, boss, it’s hard. I have to explain everything with them. Ted Genoways:Here’s another one of those voice memos to Edmond. Mackenson Remy:A lot of people want to come on this job, man. I got people, boy. I told you, I’m an influencer, bro. That’s why they trust me, bro. They really trust me, bro. Ted Genoways:Mackenson says he would charge each person he picked up at the Denver airport $120 to make the two-and-a-half hour trip from Greeley and back. He also charged for the rides to Walmart and Goodwill. But Mackenson said what he really wanted was to be hired by JBS and he asked Edmond to connect him with his boss. Mackenson Remy:He said, “Okay, no problem. Be patient.” When the second group came, I talked to him about the same thing. He told me the same thing, “You have to be patient.” Ted Genoways:Were you being paid by JBS? Mackenson Remy:Nothing. JBS never paid me for anything. Ted Genoways:And still, people kept coming. 100, 200, more. Even though Mackenson was frustrated with Edmond and JBS, he kept telling himself that, at the end of the day, he was doing something good, helping his fellow Haitians find a better life. People like Auguste. That’s not his real name. We’ve given him an alias because he’s worried about retaliation from JBS. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:25] Ted Genoways:Auguste came to the US from Haiti in 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:34]. Ted Genoways:He calls it an epic experience. And by all accounts, it was. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:40]. Ted Genoways:He first flew to Brazil in March 2023 and set off north, traveling across 10 different countries. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:50]. Ted Genoways:The journey included crossing the Darien Gap, a 60-mile expanse of thick rainforest at the Columbia-Panama border. Auguste walked thousands of miles. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:02]. Ted Genoways:He says he slept on the jungle floor, woken up by the sounds of wild animals in the night. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:13]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me he was always on guard because people warned him of armed thieves along the way, who would rob people or worse. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:25]. Ted Genoways:And then of course, there were the dead. Auguste says he saw bodies along the way, of people who would never finish the journey. It took a month, but he finally made it to Mexico, where Auguste immediately applied to enter the US legally via temporary protected status, TPS for short. It’s a rigorous process. He was fingerprinted as part of a background check, his cheek was swabbed for medical screening. Finally, his application was approved. Auguste entered the US in the spring of 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:10]. Ted Genoways:Today, there are more than 200,000 Haitians in the US under TPS, making them one of the largest groups with that status. Auguste spent six months waiting for work authorization, often going hungry. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:28]. Ted Genoways:But Auguste tells me it’s easier to live without food than it is without hope. Then he heard about Mackenson’s video. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:41]. Ted Genoways:He was living in Baltimore and struggling to find work. A friend of his already moved to Greeley and got hired by JBS. He told Auguste the job was legit, so Auguste decided to go, too. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:55]. Ted Genoways:When he arrived in Colorado, he was taken straight to the Rainbow Motel. The room was pretty small, just big enough to walk around a full sized bed, one bathroom, no closet, a mini fridge. And to his surprise, Auguste learned he would be sharing this room. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:17]. Ted Genoways:He tells me there were five, six, seven, sometimes eight people in one room. Auguste was sleeping on the floor. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:29]. Ted Genoways:He tells me it was hard to live this way. When was that? Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:39]. Tchelly Moise:December 2023. Ted Genoways:That’s Tchelly, translating for Auguste. We’re sitting together in an office at the union. Tchelly never lived at the Rainbow Motel, but he saw what was happening there. Tchelly Moise:Well, me, I was I would say not a victim of the process, but I was a direct witness to the process. Ted Genoways:It’s part of the reason he left his job at JBS and went to work for the union instead. Tchelly Moise:This is extremely bad. When you go to the Rainbow Motel and you have eight people inside of one little motel room with one bed, one bathroom, women and men at the same time, so no privacy. When people have to use the bathroom, it was a very bad situation. Ted Genoways:There was also nowhere to make food. The motel was off a busy highway with no grocery stores, no restaurants, nothing around for miles. Tchelly Moise:We’ve had people saying, “I was starving for two to three days because I don’t know where to go get food.” Ted Genoways:The people brought to live in the Rainbow Motel were in a strange place with little to no money, many didn’t speak English. Plus, it was December and freezing outside. Tchelly says people felt stranded. The motel has 17 rooms, and at the peak Mackenson counted over 100 Haitians staying there at once. It got so packed at one point, that Tchelly says Edmond was forced to rent a house nearby. The conditions there weren’t any better. Tchelly Moise:There were around 40 people living inside of the house. I’m saying people sleeping on the floor, on the blankets, people everywhere. And at some point, they didn’t have electricity in the house and it was winter. Ted Genoways:Auguste was one of the people living there. After a week-and-a-half in the motel, he spent five months in this unfurnished house. The people living there were charged $60 to $70 a week. Auguste:[foreign language 00:17:42]. Ted Genoways:But he says at least in the house, they had a kitchen. There may be a line of people waiting to use it, but at least it was there. Meanwhile, Auguste and his housemates were still expected to go to work. These jobs are essentially like working on a disassembly line, like a standard factory run in reverse. The whole cow walks off the back of a cattle trailer and is slaughtered, then broken down into steaks, and roasts, and ribs, and hamburger meat. This work is done with things like power knives and bone saws, tools meant to cut flesh and bone. It’s no surprise that this can lead to injuries. I’ve talked to dozens of people over my career who have lost fingers or had hands crushed by grinders. I remember one man who was a gut snatcher, which is exactly what it sounds like. The gut snatcher pulls all the guts out of the animal, while the spine splitter cuts through the vertebrae with a bone saw. But this time, they got out of sync. The spine splitter went too soon and the gut snatcher lost four of his fingers. Stories like these are common across the industry. According to data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, jobs at meat packing and poultry companies are consistently among the most dangerous. Workers at JBS and their union say the speed of the line makes serious injuries like amputation more commonplace. But the profits that companies like JBS make depend on how much meat they remove and how fast. Around the same time this new crop of Haitian workers was hired, JBS had introduced its aptly named White Bone Program. Kim Cordova:This is a program where what the company is trying to do is get as much of the meat and product off of a bone it’s literally like white bone. Ted Genoways:This is Kim Cordova, president of UFCW 7, the Greeley plant union. She says the white bone program meant more cutting, more repetition, more exertion, and all at a dizzying speed. Kim Cordova:The line speeds were really increasing to line speeds we had never seen before. Ted Genoways:Almost all of the Haitian workers were put on the same evening shift from about 2:00 to 11:00 PM, B shift. Tchelly says B shift had faster speeds than the day shift. Tchelly Moise:Way faster. We have people that have been working at the plant for 10, 15 years and they can tell us they have never seen any chain speed going over 390. Ted Genoways:That’s 390 head of cattle per hour. Typically, workers on the day shift rarely saw speeds above 300 per hour. Tchelly Moise:But right now, you’re having 420. At some point, we had 430. Ted Genoways:That’s roughly 35,000 cows a week. Kim Cordova:Workers are really put at risk for their safety because it is so fast. Ted Genoways:Kim says people were getting injured. Union members were going to JBS management almost every day, telling them to slow things down because this wasn’t safe. Tchelly Moise:Sometimes, we went from 420 to 410, which is still unacceptable. Ted Genoways:And it wasn’t just the chain speed. Kim Cordova:This new group of workers were being forced to sign documents in languages that they don’t speak, in English actually, that waived their rights or abandoned their injury claims. Ted Genoways:Workers’ medical cards were being kept from them. Kim Cordova:Medical bills not being paid. Ted Genoways:Workers’ mail was being withheld. Kim Cordova:The supervisor had total control of their US mail. Ted Genoways:Haitians were being treated differently than other workers. Tchelly Moise:If I asked for a break to go to the bathroom, I would not get it. Ted Genoways:Meanwhile, Auguste and his fellow Haitians would go back to a so-called home with little to no food, a line for the bathroom, and only the floor to sleep on. Auguste:[foreign language 00:21:53]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01]. Ted Genoways:… that each cow had its own little cage. Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:08]. Ted Genoways:But he was expected to share a tiny space with five, six, seven, eight of his coworkers. It was darkly ironic, but he found himself thinking the cows had it better. What does that make you think as you see that the cows are treated better than the workers? Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:42]. Tchelly Moise:He say, “It even make think about the past. I feel like I was being treated as a slave.” If we need to take a break, we can. Al Letson:Coming up, JBS is forced to respond. Ted Genoways:They told the union that they had never heard the name Mackenson, that they didn’t believe that there was such a person. Mackenson Remy:They lie. They lie. Al Letson:That’s up next on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. In September 2024, JBS made national news. The Wall Street Journal published a story about a new wave of Haitian workers at JBS and the terrible living conditions they found in Greeley, Colorado. The headline read, “Life for Haitian immigrants, jobs nobody wants and sleeping on the floor.” Mackenson Remy was featured heavily throughout, alongside allegations of exploitation from the very Haitians he thought he was helping. Mackenson Remy:Those Haitian, most of them, they hate me. They think I made money from them. Al Letson:Some workers alleged that Mackenson was working for JBS and getting paid for how many people he brought to Greeley. Mackenson Remy:Some of them, they said JBS give me $3,000 for each of them, each of them. Al Letson:Mackenson denies all of this. Mackenson Remy:I charge people to take them at the airport and I charge people if they need services. I didn’t charge anyone for job. No, I’m not a criminal. Al Letson:Mackenson says he was following directions from Edmond Ebah, the HR supervisor with JBS. Edmond was the one who told him to bring people to the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson doesn’t deny knowing how many people were packed in each room, but he says he never heard anyone complain, at least not to him. But dozens of complaints were made to the UFCW 7, the union representing the JBS plant in Greeley. And now, Mackenson’s name was in the news, alongside all those allegations. Mackenson Remy:I just like doing that for my people. I didn’t get money from anyone. When they see me, they talk very badly about me. It’s very stressful for me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, has been covering the meatpacking industry for over a decade. In that time, he’s watched JBS get sued again and again for allegations of workplace discrimination, wage suppression, and unfair hiring practices. All the while, JBS continues to grow dramatically. The company made $77 billion in 2024. Here’s Ted again. Ted Genoways:The union had raised concerns to JBS about the squalid living conditions long before the Wall Street Journal article came out. JBS had told the UFCW 7 that it was investigating, but the union didn’t hear anything for months. But now, with these allegations made public, JBS was forced to respond. So I’m sure you know, JBS claims that they had no knowledge of this system. TChelly Moise:Well, I’ve seen- Ted Genoways:This is TChelly Moise again, the union rep with UFCW 7. TChelly Moise:… the spokesperson from JBS that said, “Any allegations are completely unacceptable.” This is the exact word that I think I’ve seen online. Ted Genoways:Here are the exact words that a spokeswoman for JBS sent in an email to the Wall Street Journal. She said the company found, “Reports about living conditions, unacceptable and alarming.” TChelly Moise:What exactly is unacceptable? Is it the allegations or the actual situation that was going on? Ted Genoways:In that same email to the Wall Street Journal, JBS says it wants all of its employees to have access to safe housing. The company fired the two HR managers above Edmond. And Edmond was moved to a different facility. The company says it also put in new training programs to teach employees about proper recruitment. JBS maintains that their leadership didn’t know what was happening at the Rainbow Motel, something TChelly finds really hard to believe. TChelly Moise:It is really hard for anyone from JBS to deny what was happening when they had someone from that plant supervising those people every day, assigning them room and filling an application for them. It’s really hard for you to deny when you’re directly involved like that. Ted Genoways:I’ve seen the texts to Mackenson that prove at least Edmond knew. Mackenson Remy:If JBS said they didn’t know anything about the motel, they lie. I got the text message from Edmond. Ted Genoways:Edmond asked Mackenson, who was being checked into the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson replied with five, six names to a room. At one point in January 2024, Mackenson sent a list of nearly 50 people staying in nine rooms. But after the Wall Street Journal article came out, Edmond abruptly cut ties with Mackenson. I tried to reach Edmond many times, even dropping by his house. Marianne:Edmond? Ted Genoways:I’m Ted Genovese. This is my wife, Marianne. We were just hoping to talk to you for a few minutes if you’ve got time. Edmon Ebah:I get your text message. I’m going to respond to you. Trust me, we will have a conversation. Ted Genoways:He never got back to me, and instead, directed me to a company spokesperson. JBS did eventually send me a short email, in response to the many questions I sent them from my reporting. Their statement repeats much of what they sent the journal. They want all employees to have access to safe housing. They’ve hired new HR leaders and put in place new recruitment training programs. The company says they’ve taken the situation very seriously, but ultimately, deny any involvement. JBS says it conducted two separate investigations and, “No substantiated evidence was provided that tied Edmond Ebah or company leadership to the claims outlined by the union.” They did not respond to the fact that I’ve seen the text messages and phone calls between Edmond and Mackenson. JBS just underscored that Mackenson never worked for the company. And after the “alarming allegations came out,” they say they banned him from the plant. In response to the reports of dangerously fast line speeds, JBS simply said it follows the law. The email ends with, “At JBS, we have best in class workforce eligibility, safety and compliance standards.” But the union is still demanding answers. Here’s Kim Cordova again, president of the UFCW 7. Kim Cordova:We have been dealing with what we believe is human trafficking and exploitation of these workers. Ted Genoways:In 2024, the union filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations Board alleging exactly that. Kim says, “These Haitian migrants at JBS were brought here under false pretenses. They were promised a job and a place to stay, but the job wasn’t just hard, it was unsafe. And this wasn’t proper housing. They were sleeping on the floor of a tiny motel room with a bunch of strangers sharing one bathroom and little to no food.” The complaint calls this abuse of workers and it says that JBS’s investigations into this treatment were, “a whitewash.” And Kim believes she knows how we got here. Kim Cordova:I mean, the one thing COVID did was shed the light on what I call the dark secret of the packing industry. It exposed everything. Ted Genoways:Back during the pandemic, US meat workers were considered essential. After meatpacking plants across the country were forced to close, then President Trump, ordered them to reopen. And so even though the JBS plant in Greeley didn’t have COVID safety protocols in place, it brought workers back to the line. OSHA fined JBS for, “Failing to protect employees from exposure to the coronavirus.” If you watched Last Week Tonight, you probably heard John Oliver talk about it back then. John Oliver:After six workers from a JBS plant in Colorado died from COVID, the company’s total fine was just $15,000. Ted Genoways:But $15,000 was just .00003% of the company’s revenue at the time. John Oliver:And if you find a company, a fraction of a percent of their profits, don’t be surprised when they carry on only giving a fraction of a (beep) about the welfare of their workers. Ted Genoways:Kim says this started a huge fight between the company and its workers. Kim Cordova:We started to see workers mobilize, stand up, fight back. There were walk-offs not just here, but around the country. Workers were not going to die for their job. Ted Genoways:This not only led to more personal protective equipment, it also led to a new contract. The union had pressed the CEO for higher wages and better benefits and won. Kim Cordova:And workers got stronger, in my opinion, and I think that that’s what has sparked some of the change. Ted Genoways:Kim says shortly after they renegotiated that contract with the CEO, he retired and was replaced. Then came a wave of firings among union workers. Then came the white bone program and hundreds of brand new Haitian workers. The UFCW 7 complaint to the Department of Labor says, “The plant increased chain speeds to dangerously unsafe levels when these workers occupied the line.” Kim Cordova:In our opinion, they needed a new group of workers to come in, so that they had more control over them, especially to work at this high speed. Ted Genoways:TChelly says, he thinks the company just saw an opportunity and took it. TChelly Moise:Big companies like that, one of the first goal is to make money. And unfortunately, most of the time, it doesn’t matter how this money is made, it doesn’t matter what cost. Ted Genoways:August still works at JBS. After about six months, he was able to save enough money to move into his own place with his own bed and bathroom, but it all comes with a cost. As far as we know, the white bone program is still going on. August:[foreign language 00:10:30] Ted Genoways:And August told me he can no longer fully close his left hand, an injury he believes as a result of his work being too fast and too repetitive. Despite everything though, August says he is still glad to be here. August:Yeah. [foreign language 00:10:51] Ted Genoways:Because his life is stable now and he just hopes things continue to get better. Then came the second Trump administration. Donald Trump:We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger than- Ted Genoways:On the campaign trail, Trump promised to deport an unprecedented 15 to 20 million people and said, he would direct federal agencies to go after undocumented immigrants. But he also promised to go after immigrants here legally by ending programs like temporary protected status. Reporter:So you would revoke the temporary protected status? Donald Trump:Absolutely, I’d revoke it, and I’d bring them back to their country. TChelly Moise:Going back to Haiti is a death sentence really. Ted Genoways:TChelly Moise again. TChelly Moise:The biggest issue is not the deportation itself. The biggest issue is what is going to happen after the deportation. Because most of us, not to say all of us, we left the country obviously, because it was very bad in… You’re talking to some members at the plant, and they’re telling you, “Man, my cousin just got killed today and my family members, they just burned some house.” So it’s getting worse every day. You really don’t know where it’s going to get. It’s really bad. Ted Genoways:The New York Times has been tracking deportations and it’s found that the Trump administration is on pace to deport more than 400,000 people this year. While that’s far less than Trump’s campaign trail promise, the government’s tactics are disrupting communities across the country and a lot of what’s happening is unprecedented. There have been aggressive immigration raids in the recent past, but they usually focused on workplaces like meatpacking plants. Newscaster:Federal officials said today, that yesterday’s immigration raids at six meatpacking plants were the largest workplace crackdown ever. Ted Genoways:In May of 2006, then President George W. Bush, addressed the nation with promises of a new immigration policy. Part of that policy was to find and deport undocumented workers. And on December 12th of that year, he made good on that promise. Immigration and customs enforcement carried out a coordinated raid of meatpacking plants across the middle of the country. They were all run by Swift & Company, the world’s second largest beef producer at the time. Armed ICE officers arrested and deported nearly 1,300 undocumented workers at these plants. Here’s Mark Lauritsen, then vice president of the UFCW, speaking with PBS at the time. Mark Lauritsen:That one small community, the school district still held 25 children, some as young as six years old, because their parents were not around to pick them up. They were in a bus some place to points unknown. Ted Genoways:The Swift plants were located all across the country, places like Cactus, Texas, Grand Island, Nebraska, Marshalltown, Iowa, and Greeley, Colorado. In the Greeley plant alone, 220 undocumented workers were detained. After the raid, production came to a screeching halt. And though they were able to get things moving again, it was never back at the level it was before the raids. Within a year, Swift was forced to shut down and sell the plant. The buyer, JBS. And now you have to wonder, will JBS and the thousands of immigrants it employs meet a similar fate? Kim Cordova:This workforce is an immigrant workforce. Ted Genoways:Union president, Kim Cordova again. She says at one point, there were 57 languages spoken at the Greeley plant alone. Kim Cordova:JBS is the largest food producer in the world. The industry would collapse without these type of workers. Ted Genoways:The Trump campaign promised it would lower grocery prices, but deporting the workforce that meatpackers depend on would halt processing at every stage of the supply chain, from feed lots, to the packing house floor. This would drive up prices for Big Macs and Outback steaks, but also for chicken breasts and pork chops at grocery stores. TChelly says, “That’s why deporting all these people doesn’t make any sense.” TChelly Moise:I feel like us, the immigrants, we are a good part of the economy. Like I said, most of the jobs that we’re doing, people who are born in this country are not in line to do those jobs. They’re not actively looking to do those jobs. Ted Genoways:This is why TChelly says he’s confused. If mass deportations hurt not only JBS, but the economy as a whole, why do it? He says he’s left with only one answer. TChelly Moise:I think it’s just hatred against people with different skin color, because that’s the only logical thing that I can actually see. Deporting everyone, I don’t see how it can benefits honestly. I don’t see. Al Letson:Up next, we fast-forward to the present day to see how ending TPS is impacting TChelly and the other workers. TChelly Moise:I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:That’s coming up on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today, we’re returning to a story we first brought you in February, back when President Trump was weeks away from fulfilling a promise to not just go after undocumented immigrants, but to also target people living in the country legally. Speaker 2:A really scary time for the Haitian community as the federal government has set a deadline for deportation. The pressure is now on find answers and do them fast. Al Letson:Haitians with temporary protected status were told to leave the U.S. by August 3rd. But a federal judge intervened and extended that deadline to February 2026. This is the second time the Trump administration has attempted to end TPS for Haitians. During Trump’s first term, the White House claimed Haiti was once again safe and people could return. Several groups sued, arguing that Haitians were being racially targeted, and TPS remained in place. This time around, the administration says it’s ending TPS because Haitian gangs could be using the program to enter the US and threaten our national security. Only, the Department of Homeland Security has offered no proof this is happening. And once again, several groups are suing the government to keep TPS in place. Shelly says all of this is frustrating because not only are people like him not in gangs, they came here to get away from the gangs. Shelly:We are not really criminals. I mean, a lot of us in this country, we’ve never really had not even a speeding ticket. I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways of the Food & Environment Reporting Network has been keeping up with the Haitian workers at JBS, and he’s joining me now to update us on where things stand. Welcome back, Ted. Ted Genoways:Thanks, Al. Al Letson:Okay. So, first things first. What’s happening with the workers at the plant in Greeley, Colorado? Do they still have their jobs? Ted Genoways:So, Shelly was telling us that since February JBS has fired somewhere between 300 and 400 workers at the plant in Greeley. The Union says that’s about a third of the Haitians hired in the last year or so. Shelly:The company called them in, and they let them know that unfortunately we have to stop working. Ted Genoways:The Union says the workers were given 30 days to give the company documentation that proves they could continue to legally work in the U.S. Al Letson:But wait. If TPS doesn’t expire until February, how is the company able to fire all these people already? Ted Genoways:Well, when you’re working on TPS or other immigration programs, you’re given the right to apply for a work permit. Then once you get the permit, you have to keep renewing it. And some of these workers had let their permits expire. In the past, the company probably wouldn’t have been as aggressive about enforcing that paperwork, but because the Trump administration has put Haitian workers under scrutiny, companies like JBS are being more vigilant and asking more questions. It usually goes something like this. Bryce Downer:HR reaches out to me to say, “Hey, listen, we’re covering our [inaudible 00:03:32] here.” Ted Genoways:This is Bryce Downer. Bryce Downer:“You’re going to have to provide us with evidence of your authorization to be able to be employed, otherwise, you’ll have to be terminated.” Ted Genoways:Bryce is an immigration lawyer with Novo Legal, and has been working on cases for these workers. In theory, he says, an employer could allow time for these employees to figure out their work status, but the company risks being hit with penalties. And Bryce says companies like JBS simply aren’t willing to do that. Bryce Downer:It is a very difficult time right now for immigration attorneys that are counseling these employers, because generally speaking they’re incredibly conservative. Zero liability, zero risk. Al Letson:But I mean, losing 400 workers in just a few months, still seems like a big problem, right? I mean, isn’t that impacting production? Ted Genoways:Yeah. I actually asked JBS about the number of Haitian workers that were fired. And they said they don’t track workers based on national origin. But in a written statement, a spokesperson said that the company is focused on hiring people legally authorized to work in the United States and would continue to follow the guidance provided by the government. As for the workers that were fired, JBS said that if people can prove their status has changed, they would be eligible to be hired. And the company said, “At this point in time, our facilities are operating normally and our production levels remain unchanged.” When I read that last line to Shelly, he didn’t argue with it. Shelly:I would say that this is exactly right, because before they let someone go, there’s already someone there to replace them. So production is not really affected. Ted Genoways:According to the Union, JBS has mostly been replacing Haitian workers with Somali workers, another immigrant population whose TPS is still active, at least for now. Bryce says The industry has always turned immigrant populations because, for the most part, Americans are just not willing to take these jobs. Bryce Downer:And so who’s the next most vulnerable community in line? Ted Genoways:Basically, JBS has been jumping from one immigrant group to another for years. And as we heard in our original story, the way the company treats these workers has been under a lot of scrutiny and complaints over unsafe working conditions that the plant continue. Al Letson:Well, yeah, let’s talk about that. What happened with the complaint Shelly’s Union filed, the one accusing JBS and McKesson of human trafficking? Ted Genoways:Right. So the National Labor Relations Board is the government body that was supposed to be investigating this complaint. But in January, right after taking office, Trump fired two members of the board, leaving them without a working quorum, effectively killing any investigations. He finally announced new appointees just recently, but they haven’t been confirmed yet. So, even if the nominees are appointed, it’s possible that the Haitians in Greeley could be scheduled for deportation before any investigation can even be completed. For its part, JBS has continued to insist that it thoroughly investigated and found no evidence that showed its employees were involved in trafficking Haitian workers. Al Letson:So Ted, oftentimes these companies justify using immigrant labor like this as a way to keep grocery prices low. It’s something that President Trump even promised to do when he was on the campaign trail. So, I can’t help but to wonder what this all means for the price of meat. Ted Genoways:Right. So, the price of beef has increased 14% since August of last year. It’s such a steep increase the consumers are actually starting to cut back on buying beef, which historically just never happens. At the same time, JBS, along with three other companies, are being sued for allegedly manipulating the market. The claim is that big beef packers like JBS have a monopoly on beef and are artificially inflating prices. I think this underscores just how big and powerful JBS really is. Al Letson:And I guess when you’re this big, it’s pretty easy to fire a few hundred Haitians just like that. Ted Genoways:Yeah, just like that. But Al, that hasn’t been the story for everyone. August and Shelly are both still working in Greeley, and it looks like they will be able to continue for the foreseeable future. Al Letson:How so? Ted Genoways:U.S. immigration law is confusing, always. And it’s especially confusing right now. But when your livelihood depends on it, you get pretty savvy pretty fast. August and Shelly got new work permits, but those will expire in February, when TPS is supposed to end for Haitians. So they also did something else. They applied for asylum, which means that even if TPS gets rescinded, they may still be able to stay in the U.S. as they wait for their asylum cases to be decided. It’s a bit of a gamble, because the Trump administration has been trying to limit the rights of asylum seekers. But in theory, it’s another shot at a green card, and even citizenship. Now, there are so many Haitians who don’t have that kind of second chance. Shelly has spoken to many of them. And he says some tell him they will try to go to Canada, but most of them plan to just lay low and wait for another job, another court ruling, or even another president. Shelly:I can only wait, and I can only hope things get better. We hope something better comes. Al Letson:It’s such a tough situation. Ted, thanks so much for updating us about what’s happened since you first reported that story. Ted Genoways:It’s good to talk to you, Al.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.","On Oct. 9, the student-led organization URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity) held their weekly meeting to discuss immigration rights and the increase in border patrol and interior immigration enforcement following the passing of bills such as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and the “Keep STEM talent act.” The meeting began at 7:30 p.m. and lasted until 8:30 p.m.

URGE is a national organization with several chapters across American universities, including Washburn. They discuss all matters relating to their acronym, advocating and highlighting different communities to ensure that their voices are heard. They also work to make wellness products free and accessible on campus, such as Plan B, condoms and menstrual products. URGE is partnered with HALO (Hispanic American Leadership Organization), which is an organization that helps promote and support the Hispanic community on campus.

The meeting began with an interactive icebreaker game that many students readily engaged in. It involved throwing a beach ball with questions on it before the meeting was relocated due to technical problems.

Once the meeting was relocated, it began with a presentation from Loud Light, discussing the importance of voting and voting registration, which smoothly segued into the next presentation. The presentation informed students about the history of immigration, along with the current legislation, knowing your rights and how to be an ally.

Covering things such as the timeline and history of immigration, which began in 1776 with the publication of “Common Sense” by Thomas Paine. URGE discussed that the book relates back to current legislation and issues, as ICE continues to operate despite the recent shutdown of the government.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.

The members spoke about how being an ally can be as simple as asking what one can do to help. Including people and having discussions about current events can help spread awareness on matters and can help students advocate for what they need. URGE also mentioned that students can use their privilege to advocate for those who may not be safe to do so as well. Paloma Martinez, junior anthropology and criminal justice major, spoke on personal motives to advocate for these rights.

“What inspires me the most is my ethnic identity. I am Mexican, so I am trying to help the Hispanic community, because I am privileged enough,” Martinez said. “My mom’s white, my dad’s Hispanic, so I definitely feel like I have the ability if something actually ever happens to me.”

Empowering voices from different communities is vital in creating a healthy and inclusive environment that URGE prioritizes in their mission. Parker Whaley, vice president of URGE, speaks on what inspires them to get involved with these matters.

“[It’s] the safety and advocacy part of it and making people feel like they belong and [the] things that affect them are important,” Whaley said. “It affects a lot of people in a really heavy way and if nobody talks about it, then those communities will feel like it’s not important and what’s happening to them doesn’t matter. And that’s the complete opposite of the truth.”

The event ended by opening up for discussion. Students were welcomed to ask questions or share thoughts and stories of their own. Protests were brought up as a good way to advocate for rights and students brought up the No King’s protest taking place on Oct.18 at the Kansas State Capitol. Students were eager to engage in this discussion to provide information regarding protests and other organizations. Red Black, junior political science major, spoke on why they chose to attend this event.

“This event in particular is a really important one. While we’re closing out Hispanic Heritage Month, we want to keep that on people’s minds,” Black said. “Also, immigration has been a really serious issue with the recent political situations, especially with Customs Enforcement going into cities and impersonating police officers. We want to make sure that people are above and beyond safe.”

URGE holds meetings weekly. Their next meeting will be on Oct. 23 from 7:30-8:30 p.m. in the Blair Room at the Living Learning Center. They will be discussing the history of menstrual products and making medieval hats for their costume contest.

The HALO organization will be holding their next meeting on Oct.16 from 6-7 p.m. in the Blair Room of the LLC, and they will be having a cultural trivia night.

“Right-leaning parties tend to talk tough on immigration so that they keep the nationalist factions within their parties happy, but then quietly they act open towards migration,” Professor Gamlen said.

“They need to keep businesses happy by keeping labour flowing. So that’s kind of the classic right-leaning party’s strategy on migration for the last several decades.

“And then conversely on the left-wing side, we see the opposite kind of doublespeak in many places where left-leaning parties speak very positively about migration-driven diversity, and sort of claim to be the representatives of diversity to satisfy the liberal intelligentsia who favour human rights and migration.“But then at the same time, what left-leaning parties do is keep unions happy with strong labour market regulations which tend to cut migration levels, tend to make it harder to migrate.”

Looking at the figures

ANU has broken down the data finding the Coalition has generally expanded temporary migration.

The Liberal and National Governments tied universities to international student fees, created the 457 visa, expanded post-study work rights, and signed nearly 70 per cent of Australia’s working holiday migration agreements.

Labor has often tightened immigration policy. They raised financial, compliance, and labour standards on students and skilled workers, and introduced stricter integrity measures on colleges, savings, English language tests, and visa hopping.

Pressure to cut immigration rate

Annual net overseas migration peaked at 555,000 when borders reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic under the Albanese Government.

But have since dropped by 40 per cent.

However, there is political and public pressure on Labor to cut further.

Guardian Essential polling shows 53 percent of Australians think the current permanent migration cap for 2025-2026 of 185,000 is too high.

Populist parties are rising around the globe including the Republicans under Donald Trump and Reform UK under Nigel Farage.

The latest Newspoll has Pauline Hanson’s One Nation on an 11 per cent primary vote.

But Gamlen doesn’t believe a populist anti-immigration party will takeover in Australia.

“Although we often compare ourselves with them, the US and the UK are really very different from Australia,” Gamlen said.

“One of the big differences is that they have functionally open borders in a way that Australia does not and never has had.

“It’s partly about being an island nation, but it’s partly just about the fact that we’ve got this actually finely tuned and well-oiled machine in government and across many of our democratic institutions that is geared towards managing immigration because it’s such an important part of Australia’s modern story.”

‘Establish an immigration department’

Gamlen’s key advice to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is to re-establish an independent Immigration Department that handles visa compliance, and an independent research bureau on migration.

“There should be a restoration of the concentrated policy expertise in migration in one part of government in one properly empowered agency,” Gamlen said.

“You know if they do those two things and get the facts, set a basis for you know a common set of facts that we can all discuss a debate, that are reliable that will improve the quality of the debate, then that will lead into a better deliberation in our parliament.”",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-20315336/33d617b45c8fc6d05b0b67c258a7f354de469b1b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-11 08:56:33.918075

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE.
The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month.
Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture.
The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage.","Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month lasts from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The celebrations commemorate the rich history and culture of those who identify as Latinx and/or Hispanic. Recently, laws reinforced by the Trump administration have made it challenging for some people to come forward and openly celebrate this month.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was created in 2003. According to its official website, it aims to “protect national security and public safety by enforcing federal laws and prosecuting cross-border crime.” ICE is composed of two main task forces: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which deals with transnational crimes, and Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO), which enforces immigration laws. ICE reports to the president, who appoints the director of the organization.

The current administration has increased funding for the immigration department. In July, 2025, Congress approved legislation that gave $170 billion to immigration and border enforcement. Funding for ICE specifically increased from around eight billion dollars before the current administration to around $28.7 billion now. As a result of the additional funding, there has been an increase in the presence of ICE within cities and towns in recent months. There has been a growing number of reported instances of ICE raiding towns and homes and detaining individuals.

“We’ve seen our family members and friends from Southern California be picked up by ICE on their way to school or work, and so it just puts a lot more pressure on us here in the Bay, because we’re like, what if we’re next?” Itzel Vasquez Calvo, an Ethnic Studies teacher at Berkeley High School, said.

Berkeley is considered a “City of Refuge” and a sanctuary city. A sanctuary city is a city that enacts policies to limit its cooperation between the local and state governments and the federal government regarding immigration measures. In mid-2025, the Department of Justice began filing lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions, laws that limit the policy’s effectiveness. This led some sanctuary cities to revoke all of their jurisdiction over immigration officers. In other cities, it led to the city’s laws officially being in direct conflict with federal laws. Berkeley is one of the many cities that have had lawsuits filed against them, but they remain committed to maintaining their sanctuary status.

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE. Calvo is from Oaxaca, Mexico, and said she has many family members who are scared about what might happen if they attend celebrations. “(My family is) only willing to put themselves at risk for essential things, like getting groceries and going to their jobs and so the other festivals or concerts or parades, is kind of secondary like, ‘Oh, we don’t have to, we don’t want to put ourselves out there for no reason,’” Calvo said.

On Sunday, Sept. 21, 2025, an event called “Comunidad en al Placita” took place, organized by the Latinos Unidos de Berkeley organization. The event was supposed to be held at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, but many vendors moved inside the BHS campus in order to feel safer and protected.

The relocation came at a cost. “It was really poorly attended. Normally, there are a lot of people that come, and there’s a lot of music, and it feels very celebratory, but it was very muted. (...) People are erring on the side of caution and staying home and maybe gathering at home,” Susi Lopez, a Spanish teacher at BHS, said.

Under the presidential administration, many Latinx people are skeptical about attending celebrations this year. “As the federal government attacks our community and abducts people through racial profiling across the nation, many Latine people are afraid of being targeted. Many Hispanic Heritage Month events were brought to more secure locations this year to ensure we can all celebrate safely,” Berkeley Council member Cecilia Lunaparra said, “To me, this highlights the resilience of our community and the importance of coming together to celebrate our beautiful and diverse cultures.” Lunaparra is Mexican American with a mixed ethnic background, with parents who immigrated to the United States in the 90s.

The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month. Raquel L’Esperance Feldman, a junior at BHS, said, “I feel like the detentions and raids go deeper than just the celebrations this month because more immigration enforcement has been stopping many other events. For example, I know that Bad Bunny didn’t even plan a tour in the U.S.” Bad Bunny, a prominent and popular Puerto Rican Latin music artist, didn’t put tour dates in the U.S. in fear that U.S. immigration authorities could raid his venues to target his fans.

As federal immigration policy shifts, many still question where they can feel safe in the U.S. Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture. Multiple celebrations still took place, including El Grito de Delores on Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco, and the Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025, King of the Streets Lowrider Parade and Festival in San Francisco. The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage. According to many, celebrations like these are what bring the community together. “(ICE is) not gonna stop me and my family from enjoying ourselves and finding community … that’s literally the only thing that’s going to help us,” Calvo said.",https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/assets/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-10-at-3.59.47-pm.png,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:20.700784

Community members lined the sidewalks outside neighborhood schools Friday afternoon in Lincoln Square, part of a rapid response mobilization following word of ICE activity in the area.

Federal agents reportedly detained two people, including an employee of WGN-TV, Friday morning at the busy intersection of Lincoln and Foster avenues.

The TV station said in a statement that it is “actively gathering the facts” related to the “evolving situation.” The employee involved is not a member of the news department, WGN added.

Ald. Matt Martin (47th Ward) notified his constituents via social media that ICE agents were in the area and encouraged them to help their neighbors: “Many of the locations ICE agents have been spotted at are schools — both public and private. If you’re able, please consider supporting safe pick ups at the school closest to you.”

Erin Tobes and Audra Wunder had already formed a mutual aid team for Chappell Elementary — located just blocks from where the incident occurred in the morning — and were able to muster a sizable group by the time students were dismissed from classes Friday. Adults were posted all along the school’s perimeter.

“People are dropping everything,” said Tobes. “We’re hoping ICE will see all these bodies, us showing up as a community.”

Similar groups have popped up at other schools, including nearby McPherson and Ravenswood elementary schools, and organizers are sharing resources and tactics, Wunder said.

“We’re all starting this out of necessity,” she said.

The response teams are equipped with whistles to warn of the presence of ICE agents, and groups like the one at Chappell are also helping families within the school’s community who might need rides to work or other assistance out of fear of detainment.

Though neighborhoods such as Pilsen and Little Village may have larger Latino populations, schools in Lincoln Square enroll anywhere from 25% to 42% Latino students.

In addition to providing safe passage for students and parents at pick-up and drop-off, Tobes said she hoped the community’s presence would deter any action by agents that could traumatize children.

“We want to maintain the safety and innocence of all the kids,” she said.

Silvia Hernandez, who was among the parents safeguarding Chappell and adjacent Amundsen High School, said her 8-year-old daughter isn’t so much scared as she is upset, and even spent last night making a video calling on people to just get along.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.","More than three dozen federal judges have told The New York Times that the Supreme Court’s flurry of brief, opaque emergency orders in cases related to the Trump administration have left them confused about how to proceed in those matters and are hurting the judiciary’s image with the public.

At issue are the quick-turn orders the Supreme Court has issued dictating whether Trump administration policies should be left in place while they are litigated through the lower courts. That emergency docket, a growing part of the Supreme Court’s work in recent years, has taken on greater importance amid the flood of litigation challenging President Trump’s efforts to expand executive power.

While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical affects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending.

The striking and highly unusual critique of the nation’s highest court from lower court judges reveals the degree to which litigation over Mr. Trump’s agenda has created strains in the federal judicial system.

Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire sent to hundreds of federal judges across the country. Of those, 47 said the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Mr. Trump returned to office.

The judges responded to the questionnaire and spoke in interviews on the condition of anonymity so they could share their views candidly, as lower court judges are governed by a complex set of rules that include limitations on their public statements.

Of the judges who responded, 28 were nominated by Republican presidents, including 10 by Mr. Trump; 37 were nominated by Democrats. While those nominated by Democrats were more critical of the Supreme Court, judges nominated by presidents of both parties expressed concerns.

In interviews, federal judges called the Supreme Court’s emergency orders “mystical,” “overly blunt,” “incredibly demoralizing and troubling” and “a slap in the face to the district courts.” One judge compared their district’s current relationship with the Supreme Court to “a war zone.” Another said the courts were in the midst of a “judicial crisis.”

The responses to The Times serve as the most comprehensive picture to date about the extraordinary tensions within the judiciary, hints of which have begun to spill out publicly.

At a hearing in September, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said his court was “out here flailing” as it tried to apply vague emergency rulings from the Supreme Court that left judges “in limbo.” Ruling on a different case, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts noted that the emergency orders “have not been models of clarity.”

The Supreme Court has so far issued emergency orders in about 20 cases involving the Trump administration’s policies. In at least seven of those orders, the majority offered no reasoning for its decision.

At public events, some Supreme Court justices have defended their use of the emergency docket as a legitimate response to the increase in swift presidential policy-making by executive order, as opposed to legislation passed through Congress. Offering extensive reasoning or explanation, they argued, would risk locking the court into a position that might not turn out to be its final view.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment.

The Times reached out to more than 400 judges, including every judge in districts that have handled at least one legal challenge to a major piece of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Most of those who declined to participate did not give a reason. Others said they did not think it was their place to judge the work of the Supreme Court.

The judges who responded may not represent the views of the entire judiciary, but to have even several dozen judges out of the nation’s more than 1,000 district, appellate and senior judges express such concern about the Supreme Court’s behavior is highly unusual.

Forty-two judges went so far as to say that the Supreme Court’s emergency orders had caused “some” or “major” harm to the public’s perception of the judiciary. Among those who responded to the question, nearly half of the Republican-nominated judges said they believed the orders had harmed the judiciary’s standing in the public eye.

Twelve judges who responded to the questionnaire said they believed the Supreme Court had handled its emergency docket appropriately. But only two said public perception of judges had improved as a result of how the Supreme Court had handled its recent work.

The code of conduct for federal judges requires them to act in ways that promote “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” They seldom comment on public controversies and almost never share their views of Supreme Court jurisprudence, outside of the carefully chosen words of their written opinions.

Judge Luttig is a critic of the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Constitution who is in frequent contact with sitting judges from across the political spectrum. He said he believed the views expressed to The Times were broadly representative of the lower courts as a whole.

“I can’t think of words to capture the significance that federal judges themselves have to speak out,” he said, “because the Supreme Court has given them no choice but to speak out.”

‘An Atmosphere of Disrespect’

The emergency docket is known to its critics as the shadow docket, and its rise as a flashpoint for tensions in the judiciary coincides with the Supreme Court’s increasing use of it in ways that have benefited Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Time and time again, district court judges have imposed blocks on expansive policies issued by Mr. Trump’s administration, rulings that have been upheld by the appeals courts, only to have the Supreme Court remove them with an emergency order. Mr. Trump has benefited from nearly all of the Supreme Court’s rulings on emergency applications since his return to office.

For now, his administration can withhold some forms of congressionally appropriated funds, send undocumented immigrants to dangerous places such as South Sudan and use race as a criterion in making immigration stops, all because of emergency orders.

Some of the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire expressed concerns with the substance of the Supreme Court’s orders, fearing critics would see partisanship in the justices’ consistent siding with the president over lower court judges. Similar views have been aired in dissents from the Supreme Court’s liberal wing, which have called pro-Trump rulings by the majority “misguided,” “dangerous” and an “existential threat to the rule of law.”

For Mr. Trump’s allies, lower court judges are the ones who exceeded their authority in blocking presidential actions, interfering with what they claim is a popular mandate. That view was shared by one judge, a Trump appointee, who praised the Supreme Court for “flushing out anti-democratic rulings” with its emergency orders.

The main complaint voiced by a majority of the judges was not where the Supreme Court was coming down, but how it was doing so. By presenting its emergency orders in just a few sentences, with little or no reasoning, judges said the Supreme Court was leaving them without a clear path to assess what the justices were thinking.

The result, one judge said, was that the court was expecting their district court colleagues “to read their minds about what their view of the law is.”

Despite the justices’ brevity and lack of reasoning, the Supreme Court has become more insistent that its emergency orders are supposed to serve as guideposts for the lower courts. In an unsigned emergency order from July, the Supreme Court noted that while emergency orders were “not conclusive,” district court judges should still consider them in “like cases.”

Some justices have gone further, using their opinions to publicly admonish judges who, in their view, are failing to correctly apply the court’s emergency orders. In August, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh took to task Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for what they saw as a failure to apply an emergency ruling in one spending case to another. “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote.

In response, Judge Young issued a rare apology from the bench, though he expressed some bewilderment with the court’s opacity.

“Never, before this admonition, has any judge in any higher court ever thought to suggest that this court had defied the precedent of a higher court — that was never my intention,” he said.

Several judges singled out the justices’ criticism of Judge Young, an 85-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan and an Army veteran who has sat for more than 40 years, as a particularly demoralizing breach of decorum.

That view resonated with one of their retired colleagues, Jeremy Fogel, who was a federal judge for 20 years. Judge Young, he said, “has been at it for so long. He’s done the toughest cases, and he’s done them well. For a guy like that to get bench-slapped for not reading the tea leaves properly? That’s just not fair.”

Justice Gorsuch’s opinion could be read as “promoting a disrespect for the judiciary,” one that echoed Mr. Trump’s rhetorical attacks on judges, said Nancy Gertner, a retired judge who teaches at Harvard Law School. Both, she said, “undermine the bench and promote an atmosphere of disrespect.”

The Lower Courts Speak Out

Responses to the questionnaire were overwhelmingly critical of the Supreme Court, but they were not unanimous. Twenty-one judges either declined to answer the question about the effect of emergency orders on the public’s perception of the judiciary or said they believed they have had little or no effect.

A few judges were more equivocal about emergency orders, views that were echoed by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a widely respected jurist and Reagan nominee who wrote a robust defense of the role that district courts play in the constitutional scheme. In an interview, Judge Wilkinson noted that the Supreme Court was largely at the mercy of circumstances beyond its control: a high volume of emergency challenges to a presidency that “would put its foot on the pedal, because it has an agenda, and it’s sensitive to the fact that electoral mandates are perishable.”

While noting that the emergency docket had its advantages in terms of quickly and uniformly managing a mushrooming caseload from the executive branch, Judge Wilkinson said there were good arguments for the Supreme Court to be careful about using it too much.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days.","National Review, September 11, 2025

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a district-court injunction that blocked federal agents from making immigration stops based on certain demographic characteristics. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that location, occupation, language, and ethnicity – taken individually or in combination — are not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that someone is an illegal alien. But as Justice Kavanaugh explained in staying Judge Frimpong’s order, circumstances on the ground make reliance on such factors entirely reasonable:

Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.

Having recently published a report on the illegal immigrant share of workers in each Census-identified occupation, I can bolster Kavanaugh’s point with some numbers. Let’s take the example of landscaping mentioned above. As of the 2019-2023 period that the data set covers, about 17 percent of all “landscaping and groundskeeping workers” in the U.S. were illegal immigrants. Put another way, a randomly-selected landscaping worker has a 17 percent chance of being illegal. That’s already a fairly high percentage without adding any additional information.

But of course, we can add more. This case focused on enforcement operations in Los Angeles. A landscaping worker in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a 30 percent chance of being illegal. Furthermore, a i>Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles has a 33 percent chance. Finally, a Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles who speaks English less than very well has a remarkable 42 percent chance of being illegal.

This exercise can be repeated for other immigrant-heavy occupations. For example, about 21 percent of all construction laborers in the U.S. were illegal in the 2019–2023 period. Adding the factors of Los Angeles, Hispanic ethnicity, and low English ability increases that percentage all the way to 52 percent.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days. However, if a law enforcement officer encounters a suspect who has about a 50–50 chance of having committed the violation that the officer is investigating, then common sense suggests that a stop is justified.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/logo-facebook.png,N,,2025-10-11 07:57:18.046610

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.","A federal judge expressed frustration with Justice Department lawyers at a marathon hearing Friday as she weighed the Trump administration’s efforts to send to Africa Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man previously deported to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia is back in the United States in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, but he remains protected from deportation to his home country.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis is weighing arguments from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers that the administration is illegally punishing their client by floating various African countries that won’t accept him rather than oblige his demand to be removed to Costa Rica instead.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the judge should release their client. The judge will issue a ruling in writing later.

“They have spun the globe and picked various places they can identify, whether it’s to troll him for political purposes, essentially to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego Garcia,” attorney Andrew Rossman said.

In August, the government signaled it would remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda. After he expressed claims of fear, he was notified last month the government was looking to send him to the small, landlocked African country of Eswatini.

It led Xinis to demand the Trump administration bring to her Greenbelt, Md., courtroom Friday a witness with personal knowledge of the steps being taken so she can better assess the situation.

The government chose John Schultz, who has worked at Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than two decades and oversees removal operations in Africa and other regions.

During roughly four hours of testimony, Schultz revealed that the ask for Eswatini to accept Abrego Garcia did not take place until this past Wednesday evening. Schultz said the country declined, but “discussions are ongoing.”

“The final decision is made when the manifest is sent over, and no cases have been denied after a manifest has been sent over,” Schultz said.

After Uganda and Eswatini, Abrego Garcia recently received notice the government was intending to deport him to Ghana, but Ghana’s foreign minister hours before the hearing made clear on social media the country “is not accepting Abrego Garcia.”

Schultz testified the notice was “prematurely sent.”

His testimony left Xinis frustrated. She told Justice Department lawyers afterward they had “ignored” her order by choosing a witness who knew “less than nothing” about Abrego Garcia’s request to be sent to Costa Rica.

“If the government has not done anything to effectuate the one place he says he’ll go and the one place they say will take him, how can I find you’re really pursuing this?” Xinis quipped.

The Justice Department points to Abrego Garcia’s previous suggestion he feared persecution in more than 20 countries, which included Costa Rica.

“That is still potentially a live issue, although I’ll acknowledge the clarity given in court today could change the analysis,” Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign told the judge.

Xinis, an appointee of former President Obama, has temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation until she figures out next steps.

Schultz expressed confidence Abrego Garcia would be deported in as soon as 72 hours if the judge lifts her ruling and Eswatini agrees to take him.

“We could remove him very quickly,” Schultz testified.

Abrego Garcia’s case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown. His administration accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, an allegation he denies.

A Salvadoran national, Abrego Garcia entered the United States illegally and lived in Maryland for years. He garnered national attention after the Trump administration in March deported him to a megaprison in El Salvador, despite an immigration order protecting him from being removed there over fears he’d face persecution.

In June, the government flew Abrego Garcia from El Salvador to Tennessee to face felony human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.

Now, Abrego Garcia is back in the custody of immigration authorities, who are detaining him in Pennsylvania as the administration looks to potentially remove him again.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/abrego-garcia_kilmar_08252025_GettyImages-2231358090-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-11 09:56:57.152557

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report.
They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""
The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities.
""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios.","A new joint report from Harvard University and Physicians for Human Rights says U.S. immigration detention facilities are ""systematically torturing"" detainees through the prolonged use of solitary confinement — often for weeks at a time — in what the United Nations defines as psychological torture.

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report. Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" including individuals with mental health conditions, spent an average of 38 days in isolation during the first quarter of 2025 — nearly triple the 14-day average recorded in 2021.

Researchers say the findings, based on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, point to a worsening trend since late 2024, with the practice now used routinely and without clear oversight. ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" said Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, to Axios. ""This violates both U.S. and international law.""

ICE guidelines limit solitary confinement for people with mental health issues to exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, but the report found the policy is routinely violated. In many cases, isolation was used for minor infractions, such as refusing medical procedures or protesting detention conditions.

The report's authors concluded that solitary confinement in immigration detention ""has no place in a civil system,"" arguing that ICE's growing use of the practice transforms administrative custody into a punitive system operating without due process. They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""

The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities. It also urges states and local governments to ban or restrict the practice in facilities that contract with ICE, conduct unannounced inspections, and ensure detainees have access to legal representation and interpreters.

""ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities,"" the report said. ""Although transparency, accountability, and oversight are essential first steps, ICE must focus its attention on abolishing the inhumane practice of solitary confinement and immediately releasing vulnerable populations from immigration detention.""

The new report builds on earlier investigations showing that solitary placements in ICE custody rose 41% between December 2024 and August 2025, peaking at more than 1,100 individuals. Some detainees reported being held in windowless cells for weeks, denied medical care, or isolated after filing abuse complaints — despite DHS policy prohibiting segregation as retaliation.

""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios. ""And these are not criminals — they are asylum seekers and immigrants.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583579/solitary-confinement.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:19.218263

The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

""I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,"" she says. ""That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.""

But this time, she believes the administration is acting lawlessly, including by sidelining the unions.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2999x1687+1+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fb3%2F669b2b3d494eae8b0c9dde6077bc%2Fmonica-sarah-fed-shutdown.png,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:12.059158

WW was first to report the incident on Tuesday and asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment. An ICE spokesperson returned the message today, impugning the paper’s motives and journalistic standards.

“ICE officers do not abduct people. Full Stop,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email. “To suggest they do is what is leading to the 100% increase in assaults on our officers. A responsible journalist would not advocate for violence and instead would seek truth over clicks so it’s clear the Willamette Week is only interested in fueling the fire rather than seeking to tone down the rhetoric.""

Asked about ICE’s response today, Fuller wrote in an email: “As Trump himself said, anonymous sources are bullshit. The fact that ICE won’t attribute its comment to an actual person speaks to the baseless nature of its statement. The abduction video speaks for itself.”

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, where she joined officials on the roof of the ICE building and watched a small group of protesters(link is external), including a man in a chicken suit, stand along the road. She called them “uneducated and ill-informed.”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged arrest detainers against two criminal illegal aliens from Honduras for their involvement in a highway shooting in Virginia along I-295 on October 5, 2025.

Police were alerted of shots fired around 5 p.m. when a 911 caller reported possible gunfire along Interstate 295 northbound near the Creighton Road exit at mile marker 34.

A Hanover County Sheriff's deputy who was conducting a nearby traffic stop on the interstate observed a silver BMW matching the suspect description traveling northbound on I-295. When the deputy pulled onto the interstate, the BMW sped off, prompting a police pursuit. The Virginia State Police were called to assist with the investigation.

The two 17-year-olds were arrested. According to public records, the criminal illegal aliens have been charged with shooting from a vehicle, possession of a firearm under age 18, possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and reckless handling of a firearm.

ICE officers lodged arrest detainers with the Merrimac Juvenile Detention Center in Williamsburg, where the pair is currently being held in custody.

“These criminal illegal alien thugs whipped around in their BMW with complete neglect for the safety of Virginians when they decided to open fire on an interstate highway,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These illegal aliens were released unvetted by the Biden Administration into our country. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure these public safety threats are not released back onto Virginia’s roads. We are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.”

The final vote on the Senate's $925 billion version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 was 77-20, with Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) not voting. The passage tees up talks with leaders in the House of Representatives, where nearly all Republicans and 17 Democrats approved an NDAA last month.

Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Cory Booker (NJ), Maria Cantwell (Wash.) Tammy Duckworth (Ill.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Andy Kim (NJ), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Murphy (Conn.), Patty Murray (Wash.), Alex Padilla (Calif.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Adam Schiff (Calif.), Tina Smith (Minn.) Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Peter Welch (Vt.), and Ron Wyden (Ore.) opposed the bill alongside Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, and Rand Paul (R-Ky).

""Yesterday, the Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government,"" Markey said in a Friday statement. ""All the while, they are stealing healthcare from American families to fund tax breaks for CEO billionaires. This isn't a budget that funds America's real security needs.""

""The Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government.""

""Republicans rail that we need to cut government spending—for food assistance, for healthcare, for environmental protection—yet they are showering their defense contractor cronies with hundreds of billions for wasteful and destabilizing programs like Trump's Golden Dome space-based missile system,"" Markey continued. ""Yet they decry that funding will soon dry up for paying military salaries and for essential nuclear security operations at the National Nuclear Security Administration.""

""In their desperation to score cheap political points, Republicans are undermining vital national security missions,"" he added. ""Year after year, Congress continues to expand military spending while denying investments in the programs that will truly build a safer, healthier future for working- and middle-class families. The cost of passing this bill in the form of denied rights and wasteful spending is simply too great.""

In posts on Bluesky, journalist Erin Reed called out the Senate Democrats who helped pass the bill, given its attacks on LGBTQ+ Americans and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)—common targets of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.

""In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House,"" Reed noted.

""This year, history is repeating itself,"" she said. ""Senate Democrats dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of US troops.""

Early Thursday afternoon, Duckworth, a veteran herself, said that she was blocking the NDAA until she secured a hearing to investigate the president's ""gross abuse of our military"" by sending soldiers into American cities. A few hours later—shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in her state, Illinois—Duckworth announced that a hearing is planned.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the Democrats who voted for the NDAA, secured sufficient bipartisan support for his amendment to end the authorizations for use of military force related to the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Washington Post reported that ""the House bill also includes a similar measure, bringing Congress to the precipice of repealing the laws.""

Some other Democrat-proposed amendments weren't successful. According to The Hill:

Amendments that failed to pass included one from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who had hoped to block money for President Trump to retrofit a luxury Qatari jet he accepted as an intended replacement for Air Force One.

""Retrofitting this foreign-owned luxury jet to make it fully operational will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. That's money that shouldn't be wasted,"" Schumer said.

Still, Schumer ultimately voted for the NDAA—unlike Van Hollen, who proposed blocking Trump and governors from sending National Guard troops to another state if its governor or local leaders don't agree.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61737806&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C497%2C0%2C498,N,,2025-10-10 23:56:48.186191

Latest DB-OTO data presented at AAO-HNSF; U.S. regulatory submission planned later this year, pending discussions with the FDA

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced updated data for their investigational gene therapy DB-OTO for profound genetic hearing loss due to variants of the otoferlin ( OTOF ) gene were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented during an oral presentation at the annual American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNSF) meeting. These latest results from the pivotal CHORD trial show 11 out of 12 participants have experienced clinically meaningful hearing improvements, including 3 who achieved normal hearing levels. Additionally, eight participants with longer follow-up showed stability or continued improvement in their hearing, and among three who completed speech assessments, all showed significant improvement.

“Until now, genetic OTOF -related hearing loss was considered permanent, which is why many of us have dedicated our careers to this field,” said Lawrence R. Lustig, M.D., Chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a trial investigator. “This registrational data set showcases consistent, rapid and robust responses to DB-OTO, and for those followed to later timepoints, we’ve seen hearing stability as well as continued improvement in understanding of speech. These results are even more poignant when viewed by the families – as one of the parents said, their situation is now ‘unimaginable’ from one year ago. This truly represents a new era in the treatment of hearing loss.”

The CHORD trial evaluated pediatric participants with profound hearing loss due to variants of the OTOF gene that received a single administration of DB-OTO via intracochlear infusion. Among 12 participants (aged 10 months to 16 years), nine received the gene therapy unilaterally (in one ear) and three received it bilaterally (in both ears). The surgical procedure to administer DB-OTO leverages an approach similar to cochlear implantation, which enables use in young infants.

Nearly all participants (11 of 12; 14 of 15 treated ears) demonstrated improved hearing, responding within weeks of treatment. As published and presented, the trial met the primary endpoint with 9 participants experiencing hearing improvements at a threshold of ≤70 decibel hearing level (dBHL) as assessed by behavioral pure tone audiometry (PTA) at week 24. This threshold corresponds to a clinical standard that typically does not require cochlear implantation and enables natural acoustic hearing. Notably, 6 could hear soft speech without assistive devices, and 3 were further able to detect whispers (achieving normal hearing sensitivity). One participant who did not meet the primary PTA endpoint at week 24 further improved to achieve “nearly normal” hearing sensitivity at week 48. Nine participants also demonstrated an auditory brainstem response (ABR) at ≤90 decibels (dB), achieving the trial’s key secondary endpoint.

Hearing improvements remained stable or continued to improve in 8 participants who had follow-up visits of ≥36 weeks (up to 72 weeks). Speech development was also assessed in the 3 participants who were followed at least 48 weeks and all showed significant improvements. One of these participants demonstrated the ability to identify one- and two-syllable words with no visual cues and could respond to distant sounds and speech in noisy environments.

Across all 12 participants, both the surgical procedure and DB-OTO were well tolerated, and there were no DB-OTO-related adverse findings reported. Two participants experienced serious adverse events: one was attributed to a cochlear implant surgical complication and the other to a recent vaccination. Some participants experienced transient post-surgical vestibular adverse events (e.g., nystagmus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting), all of which fully resolved.

The U.S. regulatory application for DB-OTO is planned for later this year, pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DB-OTO received Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designations from the FDA. The European Medicines Agency also granted Orphan Drug Designation.

The potential use of DB-OTO for OTOF -related hearing loss is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About OTOF -related Hearing Loss

Permanent congenital hearing loss (present at birth) is a significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the U.S. and approximately half of these cases have genetic causes. Notably, otoferlin-related hearing loss is ultra-rare, affecting 20-50 newborns per year in the U.S. This specific condition is caused by variants in the OTOF gene, which lead to a lack of a functional otoferlin protein that is critical for the communication between the sensory cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve.

About the CHORD Trial

The CHORD trial is a registrational Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DB-OTO in infants, children and adolescents with OTOF- related hearing loss. The trial is currently enrolling children (<18 years of age) across sites in the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.

CHORD is being conducted in two parts. In the initial dose-escalation cohort (Part A), participants receive a single intracochlear infusion of DB-OTO in one ear. In the expansion cohort (Part B), participants receive DB-OTO in both ears at the selected dose from Part A.

Hearing improvements were assessed by PTA and ABR. PTA is the gold standard measurement of hearing sensitivity and is measured through behavioral responses to sound (e.g., turning head towards sound) that is emitted at different intensity levels and measured in dB. ABR corroborates these behavioral responses, serving as an objective confirmation of hearing function, and is measured through recording electrical brainstem responses to sound emitted at different intensity levels measured in dBs. At baseline, all participants had profound hearing loss (behavioral PTA), and no electrophysiological (ABR) responses at maximum sound levels.

Additional information about the trial, including enrollment, can be obtained by contacting clinicaltrials@regeneron.com .

About DB-OTO and the Regeneron Auditory Program

DB-OTO is an investigational cell-selective, dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by variants of the OTOF gene. The treatment aims to deliver a working copy of the OTOF gene to replace the non-functional otoferlin protein using a modified, non-pathogenic virus that is delivered via an infusion into the cochlea under general anesthesia (similar to the procedure used for cochlear implantation). In this gene therapy, the newly introduced OTOF gene is under the control of a proprietary cell-specific Myo15 promoter, which is intended to restrict expression only to hair cells that normally express otoferlin.

In addition to OTOF , Regeneron is committed to investigating several other targets for genetic forms of hearing loss.

TOP TALKER

IN A SLAP to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a federal judge in Chicago has temporarily halted plans to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois. The move stalls a key part of the president’s effort to boost federal presence in so-called sanctuary states.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued the restraining order Thursday, casting doubt on the administration’s claims of unrest in Chicago. She described the narrative of violence as exaggerated and pointed to the use of tear gas and military-style tactics against “mostly peaceful demonstrators” — a group she noted was never more than a few hundred strong.

It’s a legal blow for Trump, who’s leaned hard into law-and-order messaging, especially in cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Chicago and nearby Broadview — home to a major ICE facility — have been front and center in the administration’s push.

Within hours of the TRO, the Trump administration filed notice of appeal in the Seventh Circuit.

In Oregon, meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Oregon and other western states — signaled it was likely to rule in Trump’s favor on his deployment of the guard in Portland. Our story is here.

From the bench in Chicago: Perry, a Biden appointee, warned that National Guard troops lack the law-enforcement training to handle civil protests and could make things worse. “They’re not trained in de-escalation,” she said.

At the center of the case is Trump’s claim that Illinois is in “rebellion” — a legal basis to justify the deployment. Perry didn’t buy it and pressed the administration’s attorney repeatedly on that point.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who led the legal challenge, called the ruling a “victory for the rule of law,” saying the court recognized the administration’s lack of “credibility.”

The Illinois ruling drew praise from Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have accused Trump of using public safety as cover to go after political opponents.

Pritzker said the ruling shows “Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law,” according to a post.

And Johnson made clear: “The Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger.”

For the administration: Attorney Eric Hamilton defended the National Guard plans, citing the “urgent need” to protect federal agents and property tied to immigration enforcement.

After the ruling, he asked Perry to confirm that the order only blocks deployments in Illinois — she agreed.

The drama isn’t over. The TRO is for 14 days, and the Trump appeal will be on a fast track. Perry’s full written opinion will be released today.

THE BUZZ

SPRINGFIELD MOVES: Thursday’s court ruling addressed the National Guard, but Illinois Senate President Don Harmon says state lawmakers are examining how to address the federal immigration enforcement actions that are continuing in Illinois communities.

“People are on edge,” Harmon said in an interview ahead of next week’s legislative session. He cited masked individuals with no identification and driving unmarked cars as they detain people.

“I don’t know what tools we have to try to prevent that, but I’m damn well willing to try because that’s wrong,” Harmon said.

Although no specific bill has been filed yet, Harmon said the caucus is exploring options that could set legal boundaries for how and when federal immigration authorities can operate in Illinois, particularly in coordination with local or state agencies.

The challenge: “The system was not designed for the state to police a federal government. And a federal government assaulting an American state or an American city is just beyond the pale, so we are clearly in uncharted waters,” Harmon said.

Any ICE-related legislation could face legal scrutiny and political opposition, but Harmon said that’s not a reason to shy away.

,Policy,2025-10-11 00:12:57+00:00,POLITICO,Trump administration has failed to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Africa - POLITICO,Josh Gerstein,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportations-africa-00604195,"The Trump administration returned Abrego to the U.S. in June under court order.
The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country.
Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica.
“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said.
Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts.","Abrego is originally from El Salvador. He entered the U.S. illegally and lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was arrested in March and deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Courts declared that deportation illegal because it violated a 2019 order from an immigration judge who barred the U.S. from sending him there due to potential persecution by a local gang.

The Trump administration returned Abrego to the U.S. in June under court order. Federal prosecutors simultaneously charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee — charges Abrego denies.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country. But Abrego’s lawyers argued during Friday’s hearing that the administration is dragging its feet in those deportation efforts in order to keep Abrego in immigration jail and pressure him to plead guilty.

The meager and unsuccessful deportation efforts could lead to Abrego being released from immigration detention within days, if U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis concludes the government hasn’t shown it’s making a sincere and substantial effort to find a destination for Abrego.

Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica. One of his lawyers, Andrew Rossman, said Friday that the administration’s scattershot attempts to identify African countries instead show that the administration is intent on refusing the Costa Rica offer.

“We now know they are 0 for 3. Three strikes and you’re out. They have spun the globe and picked various places … to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego,” Rossman told Xinis. “What we’ve been getting in this courtroom is a lot of run-around.”

The appearance that arrangements for Abrego’s deportation were being intentionally or unintentionally fumbled by the administration was underscored by the testimony of Immigration and Customs Enforcement official John Schultz, who said lower-level personnel at his agency erred by formally notifying Abrego Thursday that the U.S. government intended to send him to Ghana.

“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said. “I believe the field office was just trying to get ahead of things so that, if Ghana did say yes, removal would be quicker.”

Xinis held the daylong hearing in connection with a lawsuit Abrego filed seeking his release from immigration detention. She ordered the government to produce one or more witnesses Friday with “first-hand knowledge” about the administration’s efforts to find a country to send Abrego to.

Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts. He said the State Department reported that officials in Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, “said no initially” when they were asked just this week to accept Abrego. But, he said, discussions are ongoing.

“I don’t know if there’s a rank structure on the next country if Eswatini doesn’t work,” Schultz said.

Schultz also appeared to confirm the White House’s involvement in selecting countries Abrego might be sent to. He said an official at the Homeland Security Council, Matt Ochoa, told him that Uganda was a place the administration wanted to send Abrego to, but that eventually fell through. Justice Department attorneys cut short that questioning with an executive privilege claim.

However, Schultz acknowledged he’d had no significant involvement in the Abrego matter before this week and said he was entirely unaware of discussions about sending Abrego to Costa Rica. That irritated the judge, who complained that aspects of her order were “ignored” by the government.

“You come today with a witness who knows nothing about Costa Rica — I mean, less than nothing,” said Xinis, an Obama appointee. “That seems to be in contravention of this order.”

Under a 2001 Supreme Court case, immigrants can’t typically be detained for more than six months unless their deportation is reasonably foreseeable.

Abrego’s lawyers and the government disagree about when that six-month clock started. His attorneys say it was back in 2019 when Abrego was ordered deported by an immigration judge, albeit with the caveat he could not be sent to El Salvador. The Justice Department contends the clock didn’t begin running until August.

Rossman argued that the time Abrego spent in prison in El Salvador from March to June should count as immigration detention, but regardless of the calculation the government failed to show it was making sincere efforts to find a country to take Abrego. The attorney said the administration is holding him “for political purposes” and to avoid going back on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s vow that Abrego will never walk the streets of America again.

During a separate court session Friday in Nashville, the judge presiding over Abrego’s criminal case set a hearing for Nov. 3 to take evidence and possibly testimony about whether the charges should be dismissed on the grounds that the Trump administration instituted them to lash back at Abrego for defeating the government in court over his illegal deportation.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F77%2Fad%2Fb8f009754aa090f4357389826bc1%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231303351,N,,2025-10-10 21:57:15.263226

Drawing on a well of constitutional provisions and court precedents, government lawyers have sought to justify deploying the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. Some legal experts say the president has the law on his side, while others worry Trump is threatening state sovereignty.

Democratic leaders have responded with outrage and indignation to Trump's attempts to send federal troops to their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established ""ICE-free zones"" across Chicago to prevent federal agents from using any city-owned property in their ongoing operations. Conservative critics have compared this action and similar opposition to the Trump administration from Democratic leaders to attempts to nullify federal law, hearkening back to the 19th century.

""Illinois's own Abraham Lincoln had some ideas about how to deal with this John C. Calhoun-esque ‘nullification,’"" attorney and conservative commentator Josh Hammer wrote on X.

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings.

""This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic,"" Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress.

The high court said in that case that allowing a state to impose such a burden on a federal institution would violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal law trumps state law.

The need for the National Guard

During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers.

""For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,"" said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department.

The rebellion statute that Trump is using to federalize the National Guard, which governors have shared authority over, can be invoked in those situations, McArthur argued.

He also said it was the government's position that the courts had no say over Trump's assessment of the need for the military. Blackman made a similar point.

""The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it,"" Blackman said.

States are ‘frustrating’ immigration enforcement

In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution’s take care clause to ""take care"" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws.

In Neagle, a U.S. marshal shot and killed a person who attacked a Supreme Court justice, and the Supreme Court found that the State of California could not prosecute the marshal for murder since the marshal was protecting a federal officer.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

Blackman said that states have for years been ""frustrating"" federal immigration enforcement and that these blue-state lawsuits trying to challenge the National Guard’s presence were an instance of that.

He said the states' resistance did not ""quite rise to the level of nullification,"" like when states in the South tried to block integration of segregated schools, but that it was ""in the ballpark."" If states were to defy court orders, that could escalate matters, Blackman said.

The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement.

Policing falls under ‘state's responsibilities'

Like Oregon and Illinois, Matt Cavedon, a director at the CATO Institute, said the 10th Amendment is also in play in these cases and that it implies that the Trump administration cannot typically take over a state's law enforcement responsibilities.

Cavedon also said it was unusual, in his view, that a Republican government would adopt a more expanded view of federal power.

""It's not usually conservatives who are arguing that there are just vast unenumerated federal powers belonging to the president, certainly in the domestic context,"" Cavedon told Fox News Digital.

""I think the 10th Amendment answers a question: Any powers that are not conferred on the federal government are reserved to the states, respectively,"" Cavedon added.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/f158c403-trump-national-guard-portland.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:58:17.923952

The Costa Rica alternative One of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.","GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge in Maryland seemed inclined to order the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention after oral arguments in court Friday, a potentially major development in the high-profile case.

After a more than six-hour hearing, District Judge Paula Xinis said a witness provided by the Justice Department showed little evidence that the Trump administration made an effort to remove Abrego Garcia to the southern African nation of Eswatini, and knew nothing about Abrego Garcia agreeing to be removed to Costa Rica.

The witness tapped by the Department of Justice was John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.

After hearing from him, Xinis said keeping Abrego Garcia detained indefinitely would likely be unconstitutional. She said she would issue an order soon.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania.

His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.

‘Three strikes, you’re out’

Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia.

“We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said.

Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention.

He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.

“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.

Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there.

Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.

“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.

Supreme Court ruling

A 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.

After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis.

Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August.

Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.

Protesters rally outside the courthouse

Ahead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.”

Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!”

Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.

Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.

“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”

White House involvement

Schultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia.

The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.

Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House.

While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini.

Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway.

“The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said.

Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.

Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.

Ghana another potential destination

Schultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.

However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia.

“This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”

Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.

The Costa Rica alternative

One of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.

Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.

Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.

Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there.

Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”

“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”

They went to work early that day; they headed home late in the afternoon. Hector, an undocumented immigrant who requested anonymity for this story when he and his son met with Mississippi Youth Media Project student journalists in Jackson in July 2025, was leaving Home Depot on Interstate 20 when he looked in his rearview mirror and saw a K-9 police SUV, its windows blacked out.

“At first I didn’t notice them,” David said in an in-person interview with the Mississippi Youth Media Project. “But then my dad said, ‘Look, there’s an SUV behind us.’”

A mile later, it was still trailing them.

The SUV continued to stay close behind Hector and his family before turning its lights on. Hector pulled the car over and waited patiently. The police officer got out, tapped the tailgate and continued walking up to the driver’s side window. David’s mind raced and jumped to what could possibly be happening. However, one thought stayed consistent: “I wish I was driving.”

Immediately, David asked why they were pulled over. The officer claimed the driver was driving recklessly. David, sitting in the passenger seat, saw nothing out of the ordinary in his father’s driving; both had, after all, been keenly aware of the vehicle following them closely.

The officer asked for Hector’s ID. David sat still, on edge, not knowing what could happen next because his father was undocumented. The officer assured Hector and his family that the stop was just going to be a warning. He then ordered Hector to step out of the vehicle for a search. After patting Hector down, the officer walked to his car and made a few calls, telling the family to sit on the curb and wait.

Within minutes, eight more law-enforcement vehicles arrived on the side of I-20 where the original officer’s vehicle had pulled them over. Brandon Police Department officers arrived, then the Pearl Police Department joined them. (Neither commented for this story.) The last cars to arrive belonged to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The main officer from Brandon began reading Hector his Miranda rights while simultaneously slapping the handcuffs around his wrists, the men told the Mississippi Free Press student journalists. Hector was charged with reckless driving.

The arrest was accomplished in a flash. The immigration sweep that ensnared Hector that day parted 27 men and women from their families. Some have been deported. Others languish. Most were caught somewhere in the tangle of immigrants, side-by-side with Hector, in the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, trapped in an American limbo.

‘He’s My Role Model’

The 17-year-old son watched as ICE ripped his father from him. “It all felt like a lot to bear,” David told the Youth Media Project. “He’s my role model, my biggest supporter. I rely on him a lot.”

The officer took all of Hector’s belongings, including $200 in cash he was carrying. They did, however, forget to confiscate his phone, which Hector kept on him during his detainment.

David watched his dad step into the backseat of the blacked-out SUV. As it sped off, his mind spun. He began running in the scorching sun after the car and watched as it disappeared from sight. The son was able to track his dad’s location through a tracking app called Life360. Once he got into Madison, David walked to the sheriff’s office.

Upon arrival, David saw a pastor who had been known to help immigrants, but this time the religious leader explained apologetically to the teenager that, due to the presidential administration’s restrictions, he couldn’t help Hector’s family.

‘“(The pastor) tried talking to some of the agents,” David said. “But they said they couldn’t help us with anything.”

The teenager, feeling defeated, finally called his mom from the station. He tried to cover his pain and panic with a simple “Hey, mom,” then told her what happened. She immediately picked him up and drove home, cautious of any further police presence.

Call in the Middle of the Night

At home, the family began calling all the local jails—and Hector’s phone—to find him. There was no response. It was almost as if he was a ghost. It was getting late when David’s mom suggested it was time to call it a night and try again in the morning. Everyone agreed.

The phone rang around midnight. David immediately woke and looked at the phone. It was his dad. The phone had awakened David’s brother as well, so they answered the call together. Hector explained that he had snuck out his phone to call them. He informed them that ICE was still holding him at the Madison County Detention Center.

“I’m OK, don’t worry. Everything will be OK soon,” Hector said as he hung up.

The boys sprinted out of the room and down the hall to wake up their mom.

“We just talked to Dad!” David told her. “He’s in Madison County!”

For their mother, it was a bittersweet moment. Her husband was healthy and in communication with the family, however briefly. But as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone. And this was only the beginning for Hector. He was up against a system that meant to keep him captive, a system set in place by years of consecutive administrations—but massively expanded under President Donald Trump.

His dad’s words that night were the last David would hear from him for the next few weeks.

Immigrant Health Care At Risk

The Trump administration has dramatically tightened immigration enforcement, with the U.S. Department of Justice aiming to enact a mass-deportation regime by framing immigrants as a “national security threat.” President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” provided tens of billions to ICE’s budget for hiring and the construction of new detention facilities, like the beleaguered but still open “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida, making it a larger law-enforcement agency than the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is engaging in expedited removal, which allows the government to quickly deport someone whom they believe is undocumented without the opportunity to see a judge.

President Trump signed the executive order on Jan. 21, 2025, to begin expedited removal anywhere in the country of any undocumented person who cannot prove they had been in the U.S. for two years before the arrest. These changes, which closely follow Project 2025 campaign promises and plans, were set into effect on Jan. 21, 2025—just one day after Trump took office.

The new governmental changes not only affect the detainee process but also the community’s access to health care. The Immigration Forum reports that 45% to 71% of undocumented immigrants do not have access to health care.

President Trump included plans to ensure that American taxpayer resources are not used to support immigrants in the United States in his “Big Beautiful Bill”—including access to health care. Parts of the bill, which he signed into law on July 4, 2025, are aimed at stopping immigrants from obtaining Social Security Act benefits, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

‘Are You Legal Here?’

Isaura Camacho, a community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, says new anti-immigration policies hurt the Hispanic community’s access to medical services. Camacho took her own parents and community members to discount clinics that were once federally funded but are not now.

“The first thing that was affected was the discounted clinics,” Camacho said. “The prices have gone up on appointments and medicine.”

These clinics were once available to undocumented immigrants who needed affordable health care, but new policies have created a barrier to services for immigrants.

Camacho described her experience assisting a young Colombian woman. “She couldn’t afford routine check-ups while being eight to nine months pregnant,” Camacho said. “The first thing they asked her while she was in serious pain was, ‘Are you legal here?’”

These new policy changes were not just hurting people who were detained but were destroying the entire community around her, Camacho soon realized.

“This immigration system was created for the U.S. to benefit; yet, the very people who are contributing to this system get no access to health care,” Camacho said.

‘Madison County Still Has Your Money’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Department processed Hector into the detention center in Madison County. They took all his belongings, along with the $200 cash he had worked hard to earn. When they took his money, they gave Hector a receipt and told him to keep up with it for the rest of his stay. He thought of this as a little strange, but he held on to that receipt for dear life.

As weeks went by, Hector began to get more comfortable in the system. He started talking to more people who shared similar experiences and, through this, he uncovered a dark secret: People who lost their receipts lost that money forever. The money was very important to detainees because that’s what they planned to use when they returned to the outside world. The receipt was their lifeline.

When Hector was transferred to Jena, Louisiana, he was instructed to give officials the receipt for his money, and he did. Instead of giving Hector the money, though, the family said Madison County, which declined comment to YMP student reporters, still had his money. It would take Hector over a month of calling with David’s help after his eventual release on bond to locate those funds.

But Hector couldn’t dwell too much on this money problem. From the time he walked into the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, commonly referred to as Jena or LaSalle Detention Center, he had larger problems to worry about.

‘I Couldn’t Even Eat’

On June 17, 2025, Hector walked into the Jena facility along with 20 to 30 detained immigrants. White brick walls loomed over him, and when he walked in, he was stunned by how crowded it was. Hector is not the only Mississippi immigrant who has been held at Jena. Others, such as Kerlin Moreno-Orellana and Kasper Eriksen, were also imprisoned there.

“There were around 90 to 100 people crowded into one cell with me,” Hector said.

The overcrowding was overwhelming. He was a long way from home. Problems in the facility began unfolding in front of his eyes.

The LaSalle Detention Center has faced several allegations and complaints from detainees saying their basic needs, such as food and water, were not met. Several alleged denials of—or restricted access to—medical treatment.

“We would have to ask two to three times before we were ever able to receive medical attention,” Hector said.

Hector said that, while detained, he and other inmates were exposed to bad drinking water, sickening him and many others. “They gathered us all together and announced to us that the water was contaminated,” Hector said. “But I was already experiencing stomach aches and problems prior to them announcing it.”

Mistreatment of immigrants, including the lack of safe drinking water, is a known problem in detention centers in Louisiana, both before Trump’s second term began and since his anti-immigration efforts this year.

The Jena processing center’s response to the issue was to give inmates one small 16-ounce bottle of water a day, Hector said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been notified multiple times of contamination issues at the processing center, as well as complaints of medical, verbal, sexual and physical abuse. Yale Law School students and civil-rights advocates filed a complaint about its drinking water and food within the past several years. The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights filed another recent complaint for a detainee who has experienced abuse at these facilities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has conducted several internal investigations on the Jena facility and others in Louisiana.

“I couldn’t even eat because of how filthy everything was,” Hector said.

The GEO Group, a private prison company, operates the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, or CLIPC, and has been managing the facility. The GEO Group runs 28 immigrant facilities across the U.S.

In response to an interview request, GEO Group spokesman Christopher V. Ferreira issued a statement on the water contamination at the processing center: “We can confirm that during the middle of June, water at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center was impacted for two days by scheduled maintenance to the City’s water main by the City of Jena. In the interim, all individuals at the Center were provided with bottled water. Water services at the facility have been functioning properly following the completion of the maintenance by the City.”

The Youth Media Project contacted the GEO group with further questions, but Ferreira did not respond to inquiries about detainees reporting being sickened during the water outage, neither how many reported symptoms of illness, nor what the facility did to treat their condition.

ICE Response: ‘At Times Things Happen’

Jena is one of many detention centers that the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses to detain immigrants. ICE’s stated goal at these detention centers is to “arrest and remove aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

The Youth Media Project spoke with Lindsay Williams, a spokesperson for ICE for southern states, including Mississippi. Williams stated that ICE has no record of water issues in Jena and does not handle any financial issues within the detention center.

“Our mission is to identify, arrest, detain and remove aliens from the country,” Williams said. “We do that every day.”

Williams says that facilities holding immigrants across the U.S. may have problems but have been or are currently being repaired. “I can tell you (that) just like any jail or any facility if there are plumbing issues or some sort of infrastructure issues, that has happened,” Williams said. “Just like in your own personal homes, at times things happen. You work around that.”

The ICE spokesman said he does not know the specifics of the water issues at Jena. However, he told YMP that ICE performs several inspections through a third-party inspector. July 26-28, 2022, inspection report, the Jena facility received a superior rating on the care of the facility.

Williams had no clear answer on ICE’s part in monies taken at arrests.

“I don’t know exactly how it all works, because it’s not something I do. There is a record of somebody being in a detention facility,” Williams said. “I’d imagine that there’s a record of what their property was or is.”

Williams said ICE’s main goal is to protect the states and to have an honest system. “One of the major things that we want to do is to get everything right,” he added.

‘We Couldn’t Give Up’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office released Hector on bond to go home with his family at the end of June. Although he was finally home with his sons and their mother, it was not the end for them. The family now has to figure out how to navigate life after the ordeal.

“We were trying to figure all sorts of things out and figuring out what is going to come next,” David said.

Hector now awaits his master hearing, which is a public proceeding where the judge explains the charges against the respondent and shares the next steps. The hearing has been pushed back to sometime next summer. Hector’s family must also continue paying the legal fees that come with the process of deportation.

“The bond alone was $7,500,” David said. “Not only that, but we have to pay for legal fees and for his attorney to represent him at the master hearing.”

David graduated top of his high school class with high honors this past May. He planned on entering the National Guard to serve as a combat medic; however, he expressed second thoughts now that he has seen the actions of the new administration.

“I honestly feel betrayed,” David said. “To get my father taken away like that months after I made this decision is heartbreaking.”

He still wants to serve to save his family.

“At times, yes, I still want to serve, and even though I didn’t join the military because I wanted to save my parents’ citizenship, I’m going to use that in hopes that it can carve them a path to citizenship,” David said.

Hector’s story is one of hundreds that haven’t been told. Similar incidents are happening throughout the entire state.

Isaura Camacho, the community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, said the system has had flaws for a while. Her family had a similar experience with ICE. “I remember even experiencing the same thing during Katrina. In 2005, my parents were wrongfully accused of human trafficking,” Camacho said.

She added that the problems create mistrust for organizations that are trying to support the Hispanic population of the state. “I want to help the community, and I want them to come to us for help.”

For now, Hector remains with his family in the Jackson area, awaiting what will come next. “We just had to keep going. We couldn’t give up,” David told the Youth Media Project.

Federal agents were present twice in the ""Alpha"" lot, a designated spot for rideshare drivers, with the most recent time being around 2:15 p.m. Agents were asking drivers if they were U.S. citizens and to show proof. One agent came up to NBC Chicago reporter Regina Waldroup and asked if she was a U.S. citizen.

As of the late afternoon, about 50 rideshare vehicles were in the parking lot. But NBC Chicago was told there are usually several hundred. Several people were handcuffed and taken into custody.

Agents showed up in nondescript white mini vans; they were at the lot for about 15 to 20 minutes.

The sweep marked the second time ICE went to the lot on Friday.

One driver described what happened around 10 a.m.

""It was pretty surprising to see them up here, though, honestly,"" said rideshare driver Donald Cooper. ""I didn't even see them. I was sitting in the lot for a nice little minute, and I pulled out, and they were all around.""

The union that represents rideshare drivers issued a statement that, in part, read:

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area, DHS previously said.

DHS released the following statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Friday evening:

“U.S. Border Patrol conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation at O’Hare International Airport that arrested of 12 illegal aliens, all in violation of our nation’s immigration laws. Among those arrested was Elvis Rodriguez-Colmenares, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela, who was previously arrested for domestic battery causing great bodily harm. These criminals will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.
The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began.
Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay.
Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.","Ms. James has called the charges “baseless” and said the indictment was “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

Mortgage fraud accusations have become one of the main tools the Trump administration has used to harass its political enemies.

William J. Pulte, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has threatened a crackdown on mortgage fraud. In addition to initiating the investigation into Ms. James, who prosecuted the president and his companies, Mr. Pulte started an inquiry into the finances of Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach the president during his first term.

The type of mortgage fraud that the president and his allies have used to bring charges against adversaries involves a false claim that a second home or rental property is a principal residence in hopes of obtaining more favorable financial terms.

That sort of allegation somewhat echoes a New York civil case that Ms. James won against Mr. Trump in 2024, which found Mr. Trump liable for fraudulently inflating his net worth to obtain loans or tax benefits. A New York appeals court panel later rejected the $500 million penalty the judge in the case imposed, but let the judgment stand so Mr. Trump could continue appealing it.

A mortgage fraud accusation was also used to ensnare Lisa Cook, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.

Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures on social media that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte said on social media. “No one is above the law.”

The move came as Mr. Trump railed against the nation’s central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and looked to staff the Federal Reserve Board with loyalists.

The Supreme Court said Ms. Cook, who denied any wrongdoing, could remain a governor on the Federal Reserve Board while her lawsuit against Mr. Trump proceeded.

“Another vindictive prosecution of someone on the president’s enemies list,” Mr. Schiff said on social media of Ms. James’ indictment on Thursday. “Another terrible abuse of the Justice Department as an instrument of Trump’s retribution campaign.”

The ruling is the third over the past week against the Trump administration in Chicago. On Wednesday, a federal judge imposed new limits on ICE agents, restricting their ability to make arrests without warrants. On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard, which the Trump administration hoped to send to protect federal property from protesters who were angered over immigration enforcement.

In all three rulings, the judges said ICE’s tactics were informing their decisions.

“The Court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the Federal Defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon,” Judge Hunt wrote.

She said she reached that conclusion after Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told the court that there would “be no change in our operational posture” until the protests stopped at the agency’s facility in Broadview, just west of Chicago.

Katrina Thompson, the mayor of Broadview, praised the decision as “a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.” She said that the fence would have to be dismantled by Friday.

“Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance,” she said.

Federal authorities had the fence installed last month in response to the protests, which sometimes turned violent. But in recent days, demonstrations at the facility have been peaceful and small in numbers. To quell the activists, Ms. Thompson on Monday issued a curfew near the facility.

On Friday morning, a few hundred protesters gathered at the facility in Broadview. Many carried signs, sang songs and prayed with religious groups. Some arrived during the curfew and were given citations, and a handful were arrested because they refused to get off the street.

Whenever ICE vehicles arrived, the crowd chanted “shame, shame.” By 10 a.m., many began to leave and the crowd decreased to about 100 people.

At the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago, it was even quieter. Michael Boyte, a 41-year-old bartender from Chicago, was one of about eight gathered to protest the arrests of two activists. One of the arrested, Marimar Martinez, had been shot by a federal agent.

“We thought it was important to come out and let the people who were arrested know that we got their backs,” Mr. Boyte said.

Meantime, immigration operations continued to make waves in the city. On Friday morning, a producer at one of Chicago’s largest television news outlets was detained by two Border Patrol agents in the morning rush hour.

These deals are the result of pressure from Mr. Trump, who has threatened tariffs, demanding that drug companies lower prices and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Pfizer said last week that its drug-pricing deal with the administration had helped secure a three-year grace period from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

In July, AstraZeneca said it planned to spend $50 billion over the next five years building and expanding factories and research facilities in the United States.

On Thursday, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for one of those manufacturing investments, at a site in Virginia that it said would help manufacture drugs for cancer, weight loss and blood pressure.

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, was expected to attend a scheduled event about drug prices at the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. AstraZeneca declined to comment.

In July, Mr. Trump sent letters to 17 of the largest drugmakers, including AstraZeneca, asking them to lower some of their prices. Officials said they were in talks with other major drugmakers about reaching similar agreements.

Under the terms of the Pfizer deal, the company agreed to sell nearly all of its drugs to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, at about the same prices that it offers to European countries. Some of Pfizer’s best-selling drugs include the blood thinner Eliquis; the cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi; and the Covid treatment Paxlovid.

Officials also announced plans to create a website, TrumpRx.gov, which would send American patients to direct-sales websites offered by various drugmakers like Pfizer. Officials said Mr. Trump’s online drugstore would be up and running next year.

Whether the deals will yield significant savings for taxpayers under Medicaid is unknown. In many cases, the prices Medicaid programs pay for drugs are already similar to those in Europe, experts said.

Under Pfizer’s agreement, the company made no commitment to lower prices for drugs it currently sells for employers, insurers and other government programs like Medicare, which shoulder most of the costs of drugs in the United States.

Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. But the disparities vary across types of insurance. Drugmakers already give Medicaid lower prices than other payers in the United States.

AstraZeneca’s best-selling products include Farxiga, for diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure; Tagrisso and Imfinzi, for cancer; and the inhaler Symbicort, for respiratory problems.

Like other large multinational drugmakers, AstraZeneca has long had a presence in the United States, its most important market. The company has moved recently to strengthen those ties.

AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange next year, though it will remain headquartered in Britain and listed in London and Stockholm.

Drugmakers that are building factories in the United States are expected to be at least partly exempt from Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs on imported medicines. His administration has said the tariffs will be up to 15 percent on drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world. His administration has delayed imposing drug tariffs he had said would begin on Oct. 1.

In an event on Monday at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected a series of similar announcements from drug companies in the coming weeks. He praised the voluntary nature of these deals over policymaking that would have most likely prompted legal challenges from the industry.

“All these are opportunities for us to re-envision the way the government normally works, not based on litigation, slowing everything down, but by leapfrogging litigation, if possible, to get people to do what they probably want to do,” he said.

The project, known as Esmeralda 7, would have comprised a sprawling network of solar panels and batteries across 118,000 acres of federally owned land in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. It was expected to produce up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly two million homes.

The developers of the project included NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, and Invenergy, a company that builds solar and wind farms as well as natural gas plants and battery storage systems.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly updated its webpage on the project’s permitting process late Thursday to reflect the cancellation. The webpage did not provide additional information.

Alyse Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in a Friday email that Esmeralda 7 consisted of seven separate solar projects and that the developers could still seek permits for each individual project.

But restarting the permitting process, which was already in its late stages, could lead to significant delays.

Neil Nissan, a spokesman for NextEra, said in an email that the utility was “committed” to its portion of the project and would work with the Interior Department.

The cancellation caused concern on Capitol Hill, where Nevada lawmakers and clean energy lobbyists said they were scrambling to find out details.

“The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, adding that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum should “clarify the administration’s actions soon.”

The move comes as the Trump administration has taken a rapid-fire series of steps to slow or stop the construction of renewable energy projects on public and private lands across the country.

The Interior Department is now requiring dozens of formerly routine approvals for wind and solar projects to undergo new layers of political review by the interior secretary’s office, a policy that is causing significant permitting delays. The agency is also opening investigations into bird deaths caused by wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters previously available for leasing by offshore wind companies.

In addition, the Interior Department has ordered work to stop on several wind farms off the coast of New England. Last month, however, a federal judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could restart work on one of these projects, a $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80 percent complete.

At the same time, the Trump administration has continued to approve permits for new oil and gas drilling and to encourage coal mining. The burning of fossil fuels is a main driver of climate change.

During the ongoing government shutdown, the Interior Department has designated employees who process oil drilling permits as essential, enabling them to keep working while other workers are furloughed.

Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, sent a letter to Mr. Burgum in August expressing concern about the new layers of political review for solar and wind projects. He wrote that the additional scrutiny could “prevent or unnecessarily delay energy development in the state that is poised to help meet the growing energy demands of the mining industry and data centers.”

Representatives for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Esmeralda 7 had advanced through the permitting process under the Biden administration, which prioritized clean energy development as part of its ambitious climate agenda. But after President Trump took office, the Bureau of Land Management declined to release a final environmental impact statement, the next step in the process to approve the project.

NextEra was among the companies that donated at least $5 million to fund the construction of Mr. Trump’s $200 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, CBS News reported. Another one of the utility’s large solar projects in Nevada, known as Dodge Flat II, was still listed as “in progress” on the Bureau of Land Management website on Friday.

Early indications suggested that the layoffs could be significant, affecting a wide range of agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Treasury, according to officials there and congressional aides who later learned of the plans.

Unions representing federal workers quickly denounced the attempted firings as illegal, as they blasted the Trump administration for trying to use the government’s work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. Even before the White House had announced that it would proceed with cuts, labor officials had sued to block them, and on Friday they urged a federal judge considering the case to intervene swiftly.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing the administration.

Many Democrats and even one Republican — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chamber’s lead appropriator — also condemned the administration for the timing and scope of its attempted firings. In a statement, Ms. Collins blamed Democrats for the shutdown but said that terminating federal workers could “cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.”

”Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said.

The White House repeatedly declined to answer questions about its strategy or the scope of the layoffs. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said only in a social media post that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to the reduction-in-force notices to federal employees about pending dismissals.

A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the cuts as substantial. The president’s aides had previously indicated they could range into the thousands.

By seeking to fire federal workers during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Rather than negotiate a resolution with Democrats, the president has embraced the government closure as a political advantage, using it as an opportunity to try to rearrange the federal budget without Congress and exact revenge against his political foes.

The administration has already canceled or frozen tens of billions of dollars in federal aid that had primarily benefited Democratic-led cities and states. Mr. Trump has also threatened to slash what he has described as “Democrat agencies,” reducing spending perhaps on a permanent basis, even though lawmakers have not agreed to any cuts.

“We’ll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, adding that he would give Democrats a “little taste of their own medicine.”

If the Trump administration proceeds with its plans, a new round of layoffs could further decimate the federal work force, which is expected to employ 300,000 fewer people by the end of December compared with January, officials have said. The staggering decline is a direct result of Mr. Trump, who has presided over an aggressive and legally contested effort to shrink the bureaucracy through firings, layoffs and induced retirements.

Under its published guidelines, the government must give workers 60 days’ notice before a layoff, though this may be reduced to 30 days in certain exceptions.

The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began. In a memo last month, the president’s budget aides essentially argued that a lapse in funding would mean that the government no longer needed to retain some of its workers.

The Trump administration even appeared to issue guidance that allowed officials producing termination notices to work throughout the federal stoppage, a status typically reserved for the most vital employees, including military service members.

Unions representing federal workers have contested both the rationale for layoffs and the administration’s efforts to carry them out. On Friday, labor officials told the judge reviewing the case that they believed the cuts could be significant, citing one agency — the Treasury Department — where they believed officials were working to issue 1,300 terminations.

A court previously ordered the Trump administration to respond by Friday, at which point the government was supposed to offer an explicit accounting of the layoffs it was seeking.

Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who leads his party on the House Budget Committee, described the layoffs on Friday as an “illegal” attempt by Mr. Trump to “seize more power for himself.”

By the afternoon, Democrats and Republicans did not seem anywhere close to a resolution that might reopen the government, with Congress having left Washington for the weekend.

Democrats continue to reject a Republican plan to reopen federal agencies into next month as they seek to extend a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance.

“I think to their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, told reporters on Friday.

But, he added, that could soon change.

“That’s what a shutdown does,” Mr. Thune said. “You put the administration and this presidency in a position where you have to make some hard decisions.”

The announcement followed a post Friday morning in which the president threatened retaliation and to cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping.

The president called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”

“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”

Markets shuddered at the developments, with the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday.

Rare earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. In April, the Chinese government responded to stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers.

The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt.

But China’s curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back. Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports.

On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls, asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology.

The Chinese government said it would require foreign companies to obtain licenses to export products containing even a minimal amount of rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. It also put new controls on technology and equipment used for extracting and refining minerals, and for making electric vehicle batteries. Those rules are set to take effect Dec. 1.

China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, and it also performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of such minerals. In addition to rare earths, the Chinese government has set out long-term plans in recent decades to dominate key industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics and biomedicine.

On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports.

The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple.

Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent.

The stock market was already on edge this month, after five straight months of gains had lifted prices to record levels, prompting some investors to warn of the potential for a pullback.

Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it may have backfired. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy.

John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.”

Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.”

Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.”

“Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.”

With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate in order to still hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added.

In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that the changes “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said.

The president went on to say that although China had a monopoly on rare earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!”

The White House has been planning a trip to Asia later this month for the president, which would include a meeting with Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.

The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips.

American farmers have also asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have crippled business this year. One of them, Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled.

“Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

In a letter on Friday to the Trump administration, M.I.T.’s president, Sally Kornbluth, wrote that the university has already freely met or exceeded many of the standards outlined in the proposal, but that she disagrees with other requirements it demands, including those that would restrict free expression.

“Fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone,” Dr. Kornbluth wrote.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said in a statement that “any university that refuses this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform higher education isn’t serving its students or their parents — they’re bowing to radical, left-wing bureaucrats.”

“The best science can’t thrive in institutions that have abandoned merit, free inquiry, and the pursuit of truth,” she added. “President Trump encourages universities to join us in restoring academic excellence and common sense policies.”

The White House has said it wants responses from the universities by Oct. 20. The other eight colleges are the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia.

The idea of the compacts has been deeply unpopular among faculty members and free speech advocates, who view them as yet another political intrusion into the affairs of academia. They argue that the Trump administration is threatening the independence of American higher education by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding to force top universities to adopt its agenda.

But at a politically sensitive moment, as schools are trying to avoid being singled out by the administration, most of the universities’ responses have been noncommittal.

“Brown’s course of action should and will be informed by the perspectives of our community,” Christina Paxson, its president, said in a message to the community on Friday.

Some schools, like the University of Virginia, have turned to the time-tested higher education strategy of delaying controversial decisions by creating a committee.

A letter from university board leaders to faculty said on Wednesday that the school’s response would be guided by principles of academic freedom and free inquiry and that the board “has no intention of abandoning the university’s principles,” according to a copy of the letter.

Others expressed what appeared to be concern about the compact but did not shut the door on signing it.

“I am deeply committed to Dartmouth’s academic mission and values and will always defend our fierce independence,” Dartmouth’s president, Sian Leah Beilock, wrote last week.

“You have often heard me say that higher education is not perfect and that we can do better,” she wrote, “At the same time, we will never compromise our academic freedom and our ability to govern ourselves.”

The University of Pennsylvania’s president hit a similar note.

“The long-standing partnership with the federal government in both education and research has yielded tremendous benefits for our nation,” J. Larry Jameson, Penn’s president, said in a message on Sunday.

“Penn seeks no special consideration,” he continued. “We strive to be supported based on the excellence of our work, our scholars and students, and the programs and services we provide to our neighbors and to the world.”

While university leaders have walked a tightrope, faculty members on those campuses have been more forceful. The American Association of University Professors, a faculty rights group and union, lauded M.I.T.’s decision to reject the compact.

“The ability to teach and study freely is the bedrock of American higher education,” Todd Wolfson, the group’s president, said in a statement. “We applaud M.I.T. for standing up for academic freedom and institutional autonomy rejecting Trump’s ‘loyalty oath’ compact. We urge all institutions targeted by the administration’s bribery attempt to do the same.”

The University of Virginia faculty senate called on its president to reject the compact, saying it threatens the school’s independence and “likely violates state and federal law” by infringing on constitutional rights. Sixty faculty members supported the resolution and only two opposed it.

The compact has complicated negotiations between the Trump administration and individual schools, including Harvard, who worry it is a sign that even if they reach a deal with the administration, the government will come back and ask for more concessions. Among the schools asked to join the compact are Brown and Penn, which had already come to agreements with the Trump administration.

The University of Virginia has been engaged with the Department of Justice’s civil rights division about a potential deal for months. As part of those negotiations, the department pressured the school, saying that its president had to resign before it could resolve the investigations. The president has resigned and the school has been negotiating a potential agreement. Because the University of Virginia is a public school, the negotiations have become a flashpoint in the state’s governor’s race.

The offer of a compact has added a layer of complication to the ongoing talks, according to three sources involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Perhaps the most enthusiastic response came from the University of Texas at Austin, which is in a state that has aggressively tried to control what professors can teach in the classroom on sensitive topics like gender.

The chair of the system’s board, Kevin Eltife, a former Republican state lawmaker, said he was honored that the Austin campus was selected. “We enthusiastically look forward to engaging with university officials and reviewing the compact immediately,” Mr. Eltife said in a statement last week.

What we know:

Agents surrounded the vehicle in a school pickup line. Though the women were not there to collect any children, the incident happened as parents and students watched nearby.

In the video, one of the women says they were followed by ICE agents from Cicero to the West Loop — a distance of just over seven miles. The incident occurred around 2:51 p.m.

The video was recorded by a teacher named Eryn, who began filming after hearing screams.

She said she saw a woman named Jocelyn shouting that the agents did not have a warrant. Eryn said she was alarmed for the woman’s safety and well-being.

Later that day, Eryn said she heard from Jocelyn’s friends and family that both women were released, raising questions on whether any wrongdoing actually occurred.

""I was scared for Jocelyn's life… I didn't know what was about to happen. Even just talking about it right now. It just makes you feel very uncomfortable. That's not something that we want to see, it's not something that's fair, it's not something that's okay. I needed to cry because that was very scary. The last thing I saw was just them pushing them into their car. I didn't know where she was headed,"" Eryn said.

The son of Palestinian refugees who “could barely read or write,” the University of California, Berkeley, researcher was captivated by chemistry at a young age after gazing at “stick and ball” models of molecules in a library. This week, Yaghi received a share of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on revolutionary materials called metal-organic frameworks.

Yaghi moved to the United States at 15 years old, initially attending community college and eventually receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His path isn’t unique: Half of this year’s United States Nobel Prize winners in science are immigrants. Researchers with stories similar to Yaghi’s have propelled the country’s global scientific ascendance for generations. But with the increasingly restrictive immigration policies and science funding austerity enacted by the administration of President Donald Trump, the country’s top research rank—and future Nobel wins—hangs in the balance.

“The Trump administration is systematically discouraging international students and undercutting the research infrastructure that attracts them,” says James Witte, professor emeritus at George Mason University and former director of its Institute for Immigration Research. “Those students will find their academic homes elsewhere.”

“I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates.”

The U.S. wasn’t always the academic powerhouse it is today. Prior to World War II, Nobel laureates mostly hailed from European institutions—before the 1930s, scholars affiliated with U.S. institutions received less than 12 percent of all science Nobel Prizes. But as the country invested more in research and conflict rocked Europe, foreign scientists increasingly migrated to the states. Most famously, this exodus included Albert Einstein, who escaped Nazi Germany, eventually landing in the U.S., and Enrico Fermi, who fled fascist Italy by attending the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm and from there decamping to New York City. At the time, most researchers emigrating to the U.S. hailed from Europe, some of whom, like Fermi, contributed to the Manhattan Project.

This trend helped fuel the United States as it rocketed to scientific preeminence. From 1941 to 1950, researchers working at U.S. institutions represented 47 percent of all Nobel laureates in science categories, 19 percent of whom were immigrants.

“That was a period when the U.S. jumpstarted the golden age of science and innovation,” says Ina Ganguli, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Growing numbers of scientists from Asia, including India and China, began arriving in the U.S. in the 1960s. This coincided with the end of immigration quotas affecting Asian countries and, a decade later, the opening of China’s economy. The U.S. share of Nobels peaked between 1991 and 2000. During this period, U.S. scientists composed 72 percent of all academic Nobel laureates—a quarter of those prizewinners were immigrants.

Seeking bountiful academic opportunities, researchers and students across the world have continued to flock to the U.S. After receiving their Ph.D.s, the majority of international STEM students settle down here and start their scientific careers, some carving their path toward a Nobel or other accolades over the course of decades. One study, looking at the career trajectories of young medalists from the International Math Olympiad, found that those who immigrated to the U.S. went on to have more productive careers than those moving to other countries. This higher productivity in the U.S. has likely owed to more abundant resources and opportunity, says Ganguli, one of the paper’s authors.

Beyond awards, immigrants have outsized impacts on innovation—in 2011, 76 percent of patents awarded to the country’s top patent-producing universities “had at least one foreign-born inventor” on the team, according to a report from the Partnership for a New American Economy.

But over the past two decades, the share of international students at U.S. universities and colleges have declined. This is likely related to the rising costs of attending school here, Witte says, which are particularly prohibitive for people arriving from low- or middle-income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with strict immigration policies from the first Trump administration, have likely also played a role, Ganguli adds.

Now, the Trump administration’s increasingly restrictive policies may exacerbate the slowing trickle of global academic talent to the U.S. by attacking academia on multiple fronts. For one, significant federal funding cuts and freezes threaten research programs that have long attracted people from around the world. Just getting here is becoming increasingly difficult. The administration introduced travel bans and restrictions affecting nearly 19 countries this summer, is ramping up vetting of student visas, and recently attached a hefty $100,000 fee to H-1B visa applications. This latter policy change could wreak “catastrophic setbacks” to U.S. research, according to higher education groups who recently filed a lawsuit challenging the fee.

Potential impacts on the U.S.’s Nobel chances likely won’t be obvious at first, says Patrick Gaule, an economist at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom who co-founded the Global Talent Fund, a non-profit that supports STEM students across the world. Over time, more young students could opt to attend universities in nations other than the U.S.—taking their award-winning smarts with them.

“It’s a very long gestation lag with the Nobels,” Gaule says, because it can take decades for one’s research to mature to the point that it’s recognized by these awards.

But an exodus of scientists already further into their careers could yield more immediate effects, Ganguli says. Even in the early days of the current Trump term, Canada and Europe were courting U.S. scientists. Seventy-five percent of U.S. scientists polled by the journal Nature said they were contemplating leaving the country, according to a survey published in March.

“If we go at this rate with more [immigration] restrictions, then I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates,” Ganguli says. “The big question is, how soon is that gonna come?”

A legal advocacy group called the Northern Immigrant Rights Project filed a class action suit against the Seattle ICE field office, she said.
U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released.
There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.
“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said.","An Anchorage restaurant worker who was detained by federal immigration officials in August has been released after a judge’s ruling in a class action lawsuit.

ICE arrested Santiago Martinez, a 30-year-old Mexican national seeking asylum in the U.S., on Aug. 11 outside the sushi restaurant where he worked and sent him to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington.

Martinez is one of at least 56 people detained by ICE in Alaska this year, according to the state Department of Corrections, which jails detainees under a contract with the federal government.

Immigration judges in Seattle were refusing to let detainees like Martinez out on bond, said Margaret Stock, Martinez’s lawyer. A legal advocacy group called the Northern Immigrant Rights Project filed a class action suit against the Seattle ICE field office, she said.

“They won their case, and they got an order from a federal judge saying that people cannot be detained, that their detention is unlawful,” Stock said.

U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released. He officially left ICE custody on Tuesday.

There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.

“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said. “And because Santiago had an attorney, me, I was able to assert his membership in the class and work with the lawyers to get the TRO issued. People who don't have an attorney, it's very difficult for them to deal with this situation.”

A regional ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Stock said she’s concerned over the high number of immigration detentions during Trump’s second presidency. The Department of Homeland Security is acting unlawfully and misrepresenting who’s being detained, she said.

“Although DHS claims they're only arresting criminals, that's not the case,” Stock said. “They're going after mostly people that are not criminals. They're going after people who are legally in the country, doing things that are perfectly legal, working legally.”

Stock said she plans to continue helping Martinez apply for asylum, now that he’s been released from detention.

Martinez returned to Alaska Thursday night.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said.
The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants.
Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland.
And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point.","Pamela Yates and Paco de Onís visited Oberlin this week for the screening of their film, Borderland: The Line Within, at the Apollo Theatre. Over the course of their time in Oberlin, they visited classes, spoke with students, and hosted a Q&A following the film’s showing.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said. “What they’re asking is, ‘What kind of things can be done now to prepare for future reckoning?’”

Yates and de Onís head Skylight, a nonprofit responsible for creating documentary films that center protagonists’ stories in the name of human rights and strengthening networks between activists. Faber, a longtime friend of Yates and de Onís, has helped organize past Skylight screenings at Oberlin, including that of their film, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator, which included outtakes from Yates’ prior work that were used as key evidence in the trial against Guatemala’s former dictator. Their latest film was created with past truth commission processes in mind. Faber noted that Latin America and the rest of the world may have much to teach the U.S. about exposing governmental abuses of power.

Paco de Onís, producer of Borderland, explained in an interview the importance of applying the same tools used by the government to track undocumented immigrants to monitor detention centers and removals of people from their homes and families by ICE. In the documentary, digital humanists analyze data on everything from these centers to companies and politicians with funds linked to ICE to demonstrate the vastness of the border industrial complex.

“They turn the tables,” de Onís said. “The whole point of journalism is a kind of surveillance of the government and society, in the sense that you’re bringing into account if there’s corruption, mishandling of government. Journalists can bring that to light.”

Together, Yates and de Onís are forging a path in documentary film that traces narratives back to those experiencing them and puts the authority in their hands. From there, narrators like Gabriela Castañeda and Kaxh Mura’l delve into their own experiences. The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants. The latter is a Guatemalan land activist who was forced to flee his home and seek asylum in the U.S. following death threats from a mining company.

“It’s important to realize what is being done and who’s doing it,” Faber said. “It’s the communities most affected that are also the most active resistors and the smartest resistors and the most inventive resistors. … The movie lays out what the interests are that are driving much of this so that the audience can come out more informed, more hopeful, and with a clearer sense of what they can do.”

The question of what could be done weighed on many students’ minds following the screening. As Yates described it, people become emotionally invested in the lives of those they’ve met in the film. During a Q&A following the Wednesday night showing, one student inquired about how Obies can use their privilege to help those who need it. Yates and de Onís pointed students to identify their local representatives and find out what is being paid for in their district by the border industrial complex, then voice their concerns. Yates in particular emphasized that all students should ensure that immigrants they know have their name, address, and phone number, in case they ever need to use it. More broadly, she spoke to the idea that everyone affects change differently, and the power is in one’s commitment to the cause.

“That is a great question,” Yates said. “And, I can’t really answer that for you. But what I can say is, you have to throw yourself into some activity … and become proximate to the immigrant community.”

In creating films that take years to come to fruition, Yates and de Onís place value back on long-term reporting. They tell compelling stories about complex issues in a moment when news is often reduced to a stream of information that can feel distant from peoples’ day-to-day lives. Borderland closes the gap by championing individuals and their place among the national headlines. Yates and de Onís know better than anyone what it is to devote themselves to the facts that build the basis for future justice.

In response to the screening and surrounding events, students have shown curiosity and gratitude. Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland. College first-year Griffin Larson-Erf spoke of his own interest in the field of journalism and said that the film reminded him why reporting is still valuable.

“Everybody says ‘tell the story, document’ … because we think it’s going to help.” Larson-Erf said. “We don’t actually know. And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point. … I’m glad the documentary exists, that all of their work exists, and I’m hopeful.”

Samantha Soto, College second-year, described at once the distinctiveness of each individual story in Borderland and the familiarity of the film’s sentiment as a child of immigrants.

“Having family members, friends that have been deported, the process of leaving your home country to go to the United States … [they’re] experiences that aren’t too out of this world,” Soto said. “I’m glad more awareness about this is spreading to Oberlin.”",https://oberlinreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masthead_alt.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:56.873635

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence.
There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.
Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.” “It involves both organized doxing.
DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing.","The Trump administration says it’s cracking down on “organized doxing campaigns,” but free speech advocates worry its use of the vague term is conflating forms of protected speech with crimes, or most recently, domestic terrorism.

The administration has accused a Democratic lawmaker and activists who document enforcement operations of “doxing,” a nonlegal term that usually means exposing someone’s private or identifying information online. But as the administration stretches the meaning of the word, civil liberties groups are growing increasingly worried that it will intimidate people out of recording or reporting on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s activities with the threat of criminal charges.

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence. In DHS’s own words, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents.”

But there’s plenty of pushback to that interpretation.

“The law protects federal agents against disclosures of personal information made with the intent to threaten, intimidate, or incite crimes against them, but it doesn’t protect ICE agents from public criticism or justify this Administration’s efforts to silence dissent, investigate activists, and recast lawful organizing as ‘domestic terrorism,’” said Becca Branum, the deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Free Expression Project, in a statement to NOTUS.

There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.

Constitutional experts and former national security officials have already expressed discomfort with President Donald Trump’s newest public national security directive, which links some commonly held Democratic and progressive viewpoints to domestic terrorism — potentially subjecting more citizens to warrantless surveillance.

In that order, the president argues that online “doxing” is essential to so-called left-wing terrorist groups’ operations.

“These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions,” the order reads, without providing examples or evidence.

“These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them,” the order goes on.

Last month, DHS issued a subpoena to Meta, demanding the social media company hand over information about accounts that posted about an agent for an “official, criminal investigation regarding officer safety,” calling it “Doxing.”

Federal judges so far have temporarily blocked the request for at least three immigration activists’ Instagram account information. Lawyers representing those users maintain that their clients didn’t break any laws.

“DHS’s Subpoena demanding that Meta disclose identifying information appears motivated by the government’s disdain for Doe’s viewpoint and a desire to chill Doe’s expressive conduct,” the ACLU of Northern California argued in its motion to quash the request.

In a separate motion filed on behalf of another user whose data was subpoenaed, the Civil Liberties Defense Center, an advocacy and legal defense nonprofit, argued that the request violated their client’s First Amendment right to anonymously engage in political speech.

“If they actually had evidence that someone violated one of the federal cyber laws, for which there are many, they would utilize those, but they don’t,” said Lauren Regan, an attorney with the CLDC. “That speaks to the true intention of subpoenas like this, which is to try and chill Americans from engaging in this First Amendment-protected activity in criticizing, or drawing attention to, ICE and the government.”

A judge last week temporarily blocked Meta from complying with the government’s request for that user’s information.

When it comes to the administration’s focus on what it sees as left-wing terrorism, doxing is clearly top of mind. A reporter pressed White House senior adviser Stephen Miller on Monday about the “vast” networks he’s claimed are responsible for recent high-profile shootings. Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.”

“It involves both organized doxing. It involves violent threats and intimidation. It involves explicit calls to commit violence against a targeted person, and then that tends to escalate into physically violent and obstructive acts,” Miller said. “It’s this continuum that we see over and over again, where they’re trying to use illegal violence and intimidation to disturb the operations of the federal government and federal personnel.”

“Who’s ‘they?’ Antifa isn’t actually an organization, right?” the reporter asked, as Miller moved onto the next question. In response to questions from NOTUS, the White House did not clarify which specific organizations Miller was talking about, or address civil liberties’ groups concerns.

“Left-wing, anti-Trump organizations are constantly looking for new ways to criticize the President’s popular efforts to Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in a statement, referring NOTUS to “the President’s antifa roundtable highlighting the countless examples of radical left-wing violence that his executive action will address.”

Doxing did not come up at that meeting, and the White House didn’t clarify how it distinguishes protected speech from doxing.

But plenty of case law protects people who post truthful information that serves the public interest, including people who film and identify DHS personnel, said David Greene, the civil liberties director with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“There might be governmental interest in shielding people from harassment, but then the government has to tailor their response to actually the harassment, not the mere identification,” Greene said. “The fact that someone is involved in something, that’s a matter of public interest — not typically something that would be considered ‘doxing.’”

Greene added that prosecutors attempting to go after people the Trump administration considers doxers would mean that the government still has to prove that the publisher intended for an illegal result to happen, according to existing statutes.

“Merely calling something ‘doxing’ doesn’t really have any type of legal effect. It’s just a rhetorical characterization,” Greene said.

If throwing around “doxing” is intended as a rhetorical tool, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has a history of using it loosely, and often.

DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing. The administration alleged that he shared an ICE official’s business card “with members of the violent mob” at a farm raid in Carpinteria, California, which DHS said resulted in someone throwing a rock at an ICE employee.

“ICE’s ‘doxing’ claims are completely unfounded. Their on-site public relations officer voluntarily handed me a business card in full view of TV cameras, reporters, and dozens of livestreamers,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to NOTUS. “To characterize it as ‘doxing’ is a deliberate distortion, and an attempt to mislead the public and deflect accountability for their aggressive actions that day, which endangered numerous civilians.”

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS routinely argues that its personnel wear masks to protect them from “doxing.” DHS and Republicans have generally characterized Democratic efforts to prohibit that policing tactic as an effort to subject federal law-enforcement personnel to acts of targeted violence.

The administration’s rhetoric about so-called doxing is especially worrying organizations representing photojournalists — people who might find themselves documenting and publishing identifying photos of federal law-enforcement personnel as part of their job.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8471c3f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5587x3143+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2F4d%2F55e870b749f19567b856a2b2079d%2Fap25129668082609.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 23:57:01.257603

Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution.
In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators.","The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is led by three presidentially appointed members who may be removed from office only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. In 2025, President Trump attempted to fire FLRA Chair Susan Tsui Grundmann without cause, in violation of the FLRA’s governing statute. President Trump asserts that the FLRA’s leadership structure is unconstitutional because it allows the President to remove the agency’s members only for good cause, not at will. After Grundmann sued, a federal district court held that her attempted firing was unlawful, and the Trump administration appealed this ruling. In October 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in support of Grundmann.

President Trump argues that under the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, the FLRA’s members must be removable at will by the President. Our brief shows why this is wrong.

We first demonstrate that Seila Law did not call into question the legitimacy of agencies structured like the FLRA, sometimes referred to as multimember independent agencies. As we explain, Seila Law addressed only the relatively new phenomenon of an agency led by a single director who is not removable at will. Based on three unique features of these single-director independent agencies, the Court concluded that they represent a novel intrusion on presidential authority that clashes with constitutional structure. The Court was clear, however, that it was not overruling its precedent upholding similar removal limits for the leaders of “a traditional independent agency, run by a multimember board.” None of the reasons the Supreme Court gave for striking down the leadership structure of the CFPB in Seila Law apply to the FLRA—a traditional multimember agency that resembles agencies dating back 150 years in every constitutionally significant way.

Our brief next explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt. In separation-of-powers cases, courts place significant weight upon historical practice, because it embodies the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of government themselves have reached. Congress has been assigning regulatory authority to multimember independent agencies for most of the nation’s history, beginning nearly 150 years ago. Supreme Court decisions, including Seila Law, have consistently confirmed the validity of these traditional agencies.

Finally, the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. The Constitution does not address removal, and there was no agreement at the Founding that presidents had inherent or exclusive removal authority. Instead, the topic was vigorously debated. Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution. In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators. These two doctrines do not conflict: both reflect established practice that settled what was initially a constitutional ambiguity.

In short, the FLRA’s leadership structure is consistent with Supreme Court precedent and established practice, and the attempt to fire Chair Grundmann without good cause was unlawful.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:58:34.640306

But can travel and tourism thrive at a time when the U.S. is working to overhaul border and trade policy?

Las Vegas, Nevada, had been a red-hot spot for travel and tourism in America, but, right now, the economy there is being dealt some tough hands.

Take dinner time on a weeknight, for example. There are, to be sure, cars at the stoplights near the corner of corners: Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. But traffic’s a breeze. Next month, a big Formula One event should bring a surge of racing fans.

And since it’s Vegas, you’ll always find some hubbub.

“I'm a big TikTok person,” said Ashley, from Toledo, Ohio. “So everything says it's going to be dead here. It's a dying city. And we're like … it's not that dead.”

So not totally empty, but using the August figures, the number of visitors is down 6.7% from a year earlier. And under the video canopy covering Fremont Street downtown, foot traffic is also sparse. Leah and Claes are part of a Dutch and Belgian tour group out sipping refreshment. They came, but, “some people of our group, they skipped the trip because the situation here in the U.S.,” Leah said.

That situation being hardened borders and a global trade war, along with higher fees to come into the U.S. and other restrictions for people without U.S. passports. For instance, the early fall has typically been prime time for people from Mexico and points South to come. But this time, many Latin-themed events got canceled. As for that other part of North America President Donald Trump talks of adding to the United States?

“Canada's down, probably the most significant of anyone, by some measures, down 30% over where they were a year or two ago,” said Jeremy Aguero at Applied Analysis. “But Canadians make up about 3% to 3.5% of all the visitors that come to Las Vegas. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's an impact.”

Among the down spots are what people here call “the three Cs”: visitors from Canada; China, with its property market mess hitting disposable incomes there; and, one more “C.” Not a country but the adjacent state.

“People from California,” said Diana Valles, president of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, Nevada. “And with all these raids and deportation and all these anti-immigrant messages that are going on right now, people — they don't feel good coming in here. They're fearful.”

“We're seeing layoffs,” she added. “We're seeing restaurant closures. People are nervous just to, like, go to the grocery store. Yeah, the people are nervous just to go to church. Even if you are documented … you never know what's going to happen. Is it your profile? When we heard people saying that they're going to deport criminals, we're OK about that. Our members are not OK to deporting people, working people, just because the way they look.”

Another shift engineered in Washington that’s percolating into every regional economy — this one included — are new import taxes, the tariffs.

Juanny Romero opened seven high-design cafes in Las Vegas called Mothership Coffee Roasters.

“Oh, my goodness. The majority of coffee is from Brazil,” she said. “And it's like, just because the president doesn't like the way the Brazilian president is talking to him, we're going to impose a 50% tariff and literally change everything overnight.”

Mothership has deals with women-owned suppliers of raw beans in Brazil — relationships not easily switched to lower-tariff countries.

“The most important thing is, like, we care from beginning to end, and that's what makes coffee really cool and relevant,” she said. “But with these things going on, a lot of roasters aren't able to care as much because prices are going up. They can't afford to care and charge their customer like — you can't charge your customer $40 for a bag of coffee. That's insane.”

Here’s how Aguero see this: “Any of these things, if it was just one of them, you and I wouldn't be even talking,” he said.

“But the combination of conflict in Washington, D.C.; conflict around the world; the fact that consumers are feeling uncertain — all of that is converging today into this very difficult circumstance that we see ourselves in,” he said. “Do I think it's permanent, like structurally unsound? No, I do not.”",https://img.apmcdn.org/b8285eff7e180461938c24535013bf06d6f7c971/widescreen/d98582-20251008-las-vegas-slowdown-tourism-trump-economic-immigration-policy-2000.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:52.149635

“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”","The Department of Homeland Security has condemned the “dangerous” doxxing of immigration agents and their families as the agency pleads to dial down the pervasive and escalating rhetoric emanating from lefty politicians and media outlets.

“The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

DHS says not only have threats increased against its agents, but assaults have skyrocketed by 1,000% in recent months as the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown.

The menacing incidents have come in the form of vicious, profanity-laced voicemails and social media postings revealing the home addresses of the federal officers, leading to several arrests.

Three women were indicted last month for allegedly stalking an ICE agent from the Los Angeles Civic Center to his home, livestreaming the unhinged pursuit on their Instagram accounts while providing detailed directions to their followers.

When they arrived at the agent’s home, they continued streaming while shouting to bystanders that their “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

They publicly disclosed the agent’s home address and encouraged viewers to “come on down,” according to the US Attorney’s Office of the Central District of California.

On Sept. 22, a 68-year-old man was busted in San Diego after he posted the home address of an ICE attorney online and urged people to harass her, or even “swat” her, a dangerous harassment tactic where fake emergency calls are made to provoke an armed response by law enforcement.

The hateful messages continued with a vile voicemail left for a Texas ICE officer’s spouse, comparing them to Nazis and outright threatening their family.

“I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F–k you, f–k your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F–k you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family,” an unidentified female said on the line, her voice dripping with contempt.

Another agent’s spouse received a message on Facebook from an account apparently with the sender’s full name, Robert Buckley, warning, “your husband, the ice man, is a f–k and retribution will come your way eventually.”

“These types of threats against our brave ICE law enforcement officers and their families are disgusting. These officers risk their lives every day to arrest murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our communities,” McLaughlin said, slamming the harassment campaigns.

CNN on Friday asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including members of the Texas National Guard seen entering it earlier in the week.

In an emailed response, the department said: “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email reads.

The statement is identical to one the Defense Department released Thursday.

A CNN crew in Broadview did not see any National Guard troops outside the facility on Friday morning.

Before Thursday’s ruling, the Trump administration federalized National Guard troops from Texas and deployed them to Illinois, arguing the troops were needed “to protect federal property and personnel who are executing federal law.”

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Illinois Army National Guard before retiring as a lieutenant colonel, slammed the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard in American cities in a Friday news conference outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

Duckworth made her comments as she and a fellow Illinois Democrat, US Sen. Dick Durbin, visited an ongoing protest outside the Broadview facility.

The site is a flashpoint in the legal battle over the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard to Illinois and send some to the Broadview facility. A federal judge Thursday temporarily halted the deployment, and no troops were seen outside the Chicago-area facility this morning, though some were seen entering it earlier in the week.

Duckworth said both she and Durbin tried to enter the facility Friday to “see what the conditions are, and they would not let us in.”

“You don’t run and hide if you are proud of what you’re doing. That’s what ICE is doing right now,” Duckworth said. “This is not America. This is not what this democracy is about.”

Duckworth also said she believes the Trump administration is trying to “normalize” the presence of troops on American streets.

“They are trying to normalize an extension of presidential power that is not appropriate under the Constitution,” she said.

“Our National Guard men and women are doing a fantastic job, but you know what? They signed up to be tank drivers. … They should be practicing to defend America against our enemies around the world, and that’s what they would rather be doing.”

CNN has asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including those seen entering it this week. In an emailed response, the department did not answer the question directly, but said, “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email read.

Speaking Friday outside the Broadview Immigrations, Customs and Border Patrol facility – which has become a flashpoint in the debate over the National Guard deployment –US Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he agreed with the federal judge who temporarily halted the Trump administration’s plans to deploy troops in the state.

“She said that the information given to the court was unreliable. It’s a point we made over and over again. This is totally unnecessary,” Durbin said of the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard.

“If you want to fight crime this is … a diversion of law enforcement from what they can be doing in our neighborhoods to make them safer,” he added. “This political theater may have a lot of opportunities for television and such, but it doesn’t get the job done in fighting crime.”

Durbin made the comments while visiting the protest site outside the Broadview facility with US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois.

Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen who was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent last weekend in Chicago after she allegedly rammed a CPB vehicle, was indicted Thursday on one count of forcibly impeding, intimidating or interfering with federal agents using a “deadly and dangerous weapon.”

Martinez was scheduled to appear in court today, but the hearing was canceled following the indictment. Her attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN he expects an arraignment to be scheduled next week.

A 21-year-old man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, was indicted on the same charge as Martinez.

The Department of Justice says both Ruiz and Martinez boxed in and struck a federal government vehicle. The Department of Homeland Security previously said that CBP agent fired “defensive shots” at Martinez.

But her lawyer disputes that account. Parente said body camera footage, which he said he viewed but has not made public, shows an agent saying “Do something, b*tch” to another agent before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” Parente said.

The video, the attorney said, shows a CBP vehicle swerving into Martinez’ vehicle — not the other way around, as the charging complaint claims. Then, “within seconds” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez.

The charging complaint says a CBP agent shot at Martinez five times. Parente said she suffered five gunshot wounds.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump’s federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

At least nine National Guard troops began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in Memphis.

It was unclear how many Guard members were on the ground or expected to arrive later.

During an NAACP Memphis forum on Wednesday, Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped Guard personnel would help direct traffic and have a presence in “retail corridors,” but not be used to operate checkpoints or anything similar.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he never requested the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump announced the Guard’s deployment on September 15 and Republican Gov. Bill Lee agreed, Young and other officials said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.

Members of the National Guard were absent Friday from outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, a day after a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s deployment of Guard troops in the state.

When CNN arrived at the facility Friday morning – located about 13 miles from downtown Chicago – no Guard members could be seen outside the facility or on the roof, where they’d been staged in previous days.

“We do not see a single member of the National Guard,” CNN’s Whitney Wild told Kate Bolduan from outside the facility.

Instead, local law enforcement observed as a group of protesters occasionally erupted in boos and jeers as vehicles passed.

Members of the Texas National Guard had arrived at the facility Thursday. Although they did not appear to be outside the facility today, it’s unclear where they are or if they’ve returned to an Army training base about 40 miles away, where they had been staging earlier this week.

Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated which type of personnel was absent outside the facility.

Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt criticized the deployment of the Texas National Guard into Illinois during an interview with the New York Times Thursday, saying it goes against his beliefs in states’ rights.

While he said he supports the National Guard’s mission to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, he thinks the president should have federalized the Illinois National Guard first, saying he worries about the precedent set for future presidents.

Stitt is the first Republican governor to speak out against the tactic. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, however, joined two filings in the Portland and Chicago cases supporting the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard.

“We believe in the federalist system — that’s states’ rights,” he told the Times. “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

“As a federalist believer, one governor against another governor, I don’t think that’s the right way to approach this,” he said.

Stitt, who is also a chair for the National Governors’ Association, said he is speaking for himself and says his views don’t represent the organization. CNN has reached out to Stitt’s office for comment.

A federal judge says Immigration and Customs Enforcement must remove the 8-foot-high metal security fence on a street in front of its building in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of intense protests.

The village of Broadview, a Chicago suburb, filed suit, saying the fence had been installed in the middle of a public roadway without local government permission or permits.

Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, had blamed the situation on Broadview.

“Local inaction has enabled agitators to escalate violence and placed federal offices, first responders, and Broadview residents in harm’s way,” Lyons wrote in a letter to village officials. “If our officers were provided the support they need, the crowd control … would not be necessary.”

Hunt ordered both sides to submit a proposal by mid-afternoon Friday to determine a deadline and process to dismantle the fence, which has been in place since September 22.

Editor’s Note: Since this post was first published, the court record has been updated to reflect that today’s scheduled hearing for Marimar Martinez was canceled after she was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday. Her next court appearance has not yet been scheduled.

Marimar Martinez, an American citizen who was shot by a Border Patrol agent in Chicago last Saturday during an altercation, will appear in court Friday to face a charge of “forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin described the shooting as “defensive” and claimed the suspect was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN on Monday the federal agents were being provocative.

Parente said body camera footage of the incident showed a Customs and Border Protection vehicle swerving into his client’s car, not the other way around as the charging document says. He also claimed the video shows one agent saying to another, “Do something, b**ch” before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” he said.

Parente acknowledged Martinez had a handgun in her purse at the time of the incident but says his client – who has a concealed-carry license – did not brandish it and has no criminal record.

CNN has requested the CBP body camera video, but federal authorities have not released it. Parente is not allowed to share a copy of the video because it is covered under a protective order from the court.

In a criminal complaint, Martinez was described as part of a “convoy of civilian vehicles” that was “aggressively” following a Chevy Tahoe with three Border Patrol agents inside through Chicago streets, attempting to “box-in the CBP Vehicle.”

After the vehicle was sideswiped by Martinez, according to an FBI affidavit, a Border Patrol agent exited their SUV and fired on the car driven by Martinez five times.

Martinez drove to a repair shop a mile away, according to the complaint, and called 911. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where a nurse said she was treated for gunshot wounds, the complaint states. Martinez was later released from the hospital and is free on a $10,000 bond.

CNN’s Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.

After video of a Chicago pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside of an ICE facility went viral, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order Thursday to limit the types of force and crowd-control measures agents can use against protesters.

The judge’s order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from firing various types of less-lethal projectiles and chemical irritants and from “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual.”

In an interview with CNN, Rev. David Black said agents shot him in the head and the face and “multiple times” in his chest, arms and legs during a September 19 demonstration outside of an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there, who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black told CNN. “We could hear them laughing as they were shooting us from the roof … It was deeply disturbing.”

The future of National Guard troops now standing by for deployment in Portland, Oregon, is in the hands of a three-judge appeals panel in San Francisco, following a hearing in which the conservative majority expressed skepticism that President Trump’s orders could be constrained.

The attorney representing Oregon argued that the protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that have been going on for months are no longer experiencing the violence cited by Trump in his original order and the current clashes can be handled by non-military means.

The appeals court did not give a timetable for when it will make a decision.

Even if the Trump administration gets the stay they are requesting, Guardsmen would still be prohibited from mobilizing in Oregon under a separate order by District Court Judge Karin Immergut, who is also a Trump appointee to the bench. But administration attorney Eric McArthur said if their appeal is successful, they will ask Immergut to immediately cancel her order, which is scheduled to expire on October 19.

CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report from Portland.

The mayor of Chicago declared victory Thursday over the Trump administration’s efforts to mobilize the military in that city – at least for the next two weeks.

“This ruling is a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement after US District Court Judge April Perry blocked any National Guard troops from being deployed in Illinois until at least the end of the day on October 23.

The decision came at the end of a contentious hearing that stretched on for hours in a Chicago courtroom, with Perry – a Biden appointee – expressing strong skepticism that continuing protests outside a suburban Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility prevented federal agents from doing their jobs.

The Trump administration immediately announced it will appeal the ruling. That appeal had not been filed with the court as of Friday morning.

Unlike the judge in a similar case in Portland, Oregon, Perry did not suspend President Trump’s order federalizing hundreds of Illinois guardsmen against the wishes of the government, and the administration says there will be no change to their status.

Members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, early Thursday morning. It’s not clear if they will remain there or go back to a base 40 miles away where they were staging when they first arrived from Texas.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul declined to speculate on what would happen if the troops don’t leave the ICE facility, saying if they believe the judge’s order isn’t being followed, the state will take that up with the court. But he added the Texas troops do not have to leave the state as long as they are not mobilized.

“They’re welcome to stay at our hotels if they pay the hotel rate,” said Raoul. “They’re welcome to eat at our restaurants like any American city.”

Francisco Miranda, 46, was leaving work on Friday, Oct. 4, when he was approached by two plain-clothed immigration officers wearing masks, who repeatedly told him that he was “here on an overstay,” meaning he had stayed in the country longer than he was allowed as a non-citizen.

Miranda recorded much of the interaction on his cellphone before it was confiscated by immigration officials. The video appears to show officers asking him repeatedly where he was born, which he responded was in California.

Miranda’s attorney, Michael Fuller, wrote in a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, that Miranda showed the officers his Oregon driver’s license, but officers handcuffed him, struck him so hard they knocked him to the ground, then placed him in the back of an unmarked van.

Miranda was taken to the ICE facility in Portland and detained for hours, Fuller said.

He was eventually released, Fuller said, “without being given any legitimate reason for his abduction.”

Miranda’s arrest was first reported by Willamette Week.

In the days since Miranda’s arrest, Congresswoman Janelle Bynum has called for an investigation into what happened, saying that raids by ICE are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act of the mid-1800s, when law enforcement would hunt down runaway slaves.

“That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history,” Bynum wrote in a statement. “We must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

The Milwaukie City Council has also condemned the actions.

“This is not just unconstitutional, it is immoral,” the council wrote in a shared statement, “It represents an affront to the basic values of our nation and to this community: dignity of the individual, compassion for our neighbors, fairness under the law, and respect for human life.”

Miranda’s case is not unique. The agency has been criticized for detaining, and sometimes deporting, U.S. citizens by mistake several times over the years. Reports of such incidents have increased over the past year, since the Trump administration expanded ICE’s mission, giving them more authority to find people living in the U.S. illegally.",https://oregoncapitalinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/10/IMG_1772-1536x1152-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:58:09.810169

Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is ""intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.""
While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.","Greenbelt, Maryland — A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.

Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.

Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who ""knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica."" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, ""getting to the three strikes, you're out.""

The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of human smuggling plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.

Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.

Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.

Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.

The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.

Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country ""is not accepting Abrego Garcia.""

""He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,"" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. ""In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.""

Schultz said he is ""confident"" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.

Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take ""in the reasonably foreseeable future"" to deport Abrego Garcia.

Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision that found federal law does not permit ""indefinite detention"" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a ""period reasonably necessary"" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.

After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a ""purported"" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the ""presumptively reasonable period"" of detention would've expired in 2020.

Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in ""continuous confinement"" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained — with the exception of a brief weekend in August.

The ""U.S. government held the keys"" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.

Rossman said the administration is ""0 for 3"" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.

The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him ""upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.""

Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is ""intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.""

""They have spun the globe and picked various places,"" he said, to effectively ""fail on purpose"" by selecting countries that would be ""completely unpalatable"" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated — during which he would remain detained.

""That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,"" Rossman said.

Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.

""Why hasn't there been?"" she said of discussions.

Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.

Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.

He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.

He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.

Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been ""vindictive,"" writing on Friday that ""The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success."" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.

There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.
ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.
Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.
“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court.","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests continue to soar across the country, federal judges in San Francisco are rebuking the agency over due process concerns and have ordered the release – at least temporarily – of dozens of immigrants being held in detention facilities across California and beyond.

The judges’ orders come in response to a wave of legal filings from attorneys representing immigrants being held in ICE detention – called “petitions for writ of habeas corpus” – arguing their clients are being illegally and indefinitely locked up without being afforded a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

An NBC Bay Area review of 24 habeas cases filed in the Bay Area’s federal court district – involving 37 separate immigrants detained by ICE in recent months – found that in every case, judges have issued temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions granting the temporary release of those immigrants until their habeas petitions are resolved.

In a small handful of other cases, judges have yet to rule on the detainee’s motion for a temporary restraining order that would release them from ICE custody.

“The violation of constitutional rights is so egregious,” said Jordan Weiner, who heads the immigration defense program at the San Francisco nonprofit La Raza Centro Legal. “Just arbitrarily arresting someone who hasn’t missed any court hearings or hasn’t committed any crimes.”

Until recently, Weiner said her work typically focused on helping immigrants navigate their asylum cases, not fighting in federal court to free them from detention.

“That’s all changed because ICE agents have been waiting for them in court and arresting them,” said Weiner, who also serves on the San Francisco and San Mateo County Rapid Response Networks, which dispatch attorneys to provide legal aid when immigrants are detained by ICE.

In San Francisco, ICE agents have arrested dozens of immigrants – many of them asylum seekers – after hearings in immigration court, according to multiple Rapid Response Network attorneys. Others have been detained at routine ICE check-ins.

Immigration cases are considered a civil matter in the U.S., and immigrant rights advocates have slammed the agency for the widespread detention of people who are not being held in connection to an alleged crime.

One habeas petition, filed in late July, described the arrest of an asylum seeker who fled Peru and arrived in the U.S. nearly three years ago. When he first arrived in the U.S., according to the petition, federal agents “briefly detained him” before releasing him on his own recognizance with a notice to appear for removal proceedings in immigration court.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.

A day after the habeas petition was filed, federal Judge Trina Thompson issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to release the asylum seeker from custody.

“District courts have routinely granted temporary restraining orders barring the government from detaining noncitizens who have been on longstanding release in their immigration proceedings, without first holding a pre-deprivation hearing before a neutral decisionmaker,” Thompson wrote in her order.

The judge has since issued a preliminary injunction ordering the immigrant’s continued release from ICE custody until the resolution of his habeas case.

“He risks being separated from his family and community, and being subjected to ICE’s inadequate, subpar medical care,” Thompson wrote in her order granting the preliminary injunction. “The public has an interest in preventing constitutional violations, and Respondents-Defendants only risk minimal harm in delaying Petitioner-Plaintiff’s detention.”

For decades, immigration judges have been permitted to grant bond to migrants who were not deemed a safety threat – and who attended mandatory ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings – until their cases were resolved.

However, a July Department of Homeland Security policy memo stated that anyone who crossed the border without permission would be classified as “an applicant for admission” to the U.S, irrespective of when they arrived. According to the memo, those immigrants would be subject to mandatory detention and immigration judges – who serve under the Department of Justice, not the judiciary– lack the authority to hold bond hearings.

In September, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) – also under the executive branch – upheld the administration’s interpretation of the law. Government attorneys opposing the wave of habeas petitions hitting federal court have cited the BIA decision, and the underlying regulations, in support of keeping many immigrants in detention for the duration of their pending immigration cases.

Attorneys such as Weiner, however, say the new policy upends decades of tradition, and call the practice a violation of immigrants’ civil liberties.

“Our argument is that the constitution protects people from arbitrary deprivations of liberty,” Weiner said.

Time after time, federal judges are agreeing.

NBC Bay Area was in federal court in September when a seemingly frustrated Judge James Donato pressed an assistant U.S. attorney on why ICE continues to detain migrants without giving them a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney.

“There’s an easy answer here, government: Just give them a hearing,” Donato added.

ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.

Weiner said most, if not every federal judge in San Francisco, likely has at least one habeas case involving an ICE detainee on their plate, something that has not gone unnoticed by Donato.

“What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again and again and again in front of every judge in this district,” Donato asked.

Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.

Jorge Valera - an asylum seeker from Peru with no criminal record, according to his habeas petition – is one of the detainees a judge ordered ICE to set free.

“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court. “They shackled my feet. I am not a criminal, I am not a murderer.”

Valera said he was sent to a detention center in Arizona and spent a week in ICE custody before a judge ordered ICE to release him.

Weiner said her “little nonprofit” is focusing on what they can, but they’re hoping others will take up the cause.

“I just want to show that this is how they’re spending their time and resources,” Weiner said. “I’m hoping to shine a light on the lengths that the government is willing to go. They don’t care that the local AUSAs, the local government attorneys defending these cases are overworked and fighting losing cases over and over again.”",https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/10/ice-releases-1010-e1760102488903.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-10 18:57:50.013683

But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.
The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.
Yet the GAO found no formal procedures inside the State Department for making, recording, and sharing their decision-making process.
Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.","On paper, the guardrails are clear. When the U.S. ships weapons overseas, partner governments promise three things: That they’ll use them only for authorized purposes, keep them secure, and not hand them off to third parties.

If those conditions are violated or serious suspicions arise that they are, the State Department is obligated to investigate and, in many cases, alert Congress.

In practice, however, a new Government Accountability Office report shows the system is ad hoc, with little guidance or follow through.

The State Department largely relies on overseas Defense Department officials for tips about potential end-use violations.

Since 2019, the Pentagon has flagged more than 150 incidents that could be violations. But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.

The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.

Experts in the arms trafficking and conflict monitoring are dismayed, calling the reported gaps an affront to both national and global security.

“It was really shocking to see how far the U.S had fallen behind,” said Kathi Lynn Austin, executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project, who added the number of potential incidents flagged was “extraordinary.”

“We are violating our law and not protecting our own security — at a time when there is so much volatility in the world,” Austin said. “We need to understand this is urgent, and Congress needs to push to maintain transparency and public trust in our arms dealings.”

The 39-page GAO report, published to little notice in September, lays out a simple mismatch: Defense personnel stationed abroad are often the first to see or hear about possible violations, but diplomats with the State Department haven’t told military officials clearly what to flag. (GAO, Pentagon, and State Department officials said the government shutdown left them unavailable to comment.)

In other instances of being tipped to potential violations, the GAO says, the State Department could not produce records showing whether anyone ever decided if the law’s reporting thresholds were met.

The Arms Export Control Act requires notifying Congress when there’s information that a substantial violation may have occurred regarding purpose, transfer, or security; it also requires reporting when an unauthorized transfer actually happens. Those are low thresholds for alerting the legislature, by design. Yet the GAO found no formal procedures inside the State Department for making, recording, and sharing their decision-making process.

In the report, the State Department agreed with GAO’s six recommendations, including providing concrete guidance to the Pentagon, standardizing investigations with timelines, and creating procedures for deciding and documenting what gets reported to Congress.

The GAO cannot force a federal agency to bend to its report and relies on voluntary compliance.

If the changes aren’t actually implemented, however, Congress will continue flying blind when it comes to U.S. arms sales negatively impacting national — and international — security.

The Misuse Pipeline

The mechanics of “end-use” sound bureaucratic, but the stakes aren’t. Around the world, U.S.-made weapons moves from legal sale to illicit use on the battlefield, stolen from depots, through corrupt commanders, transfers to proxies, or simple loss.

The results are everywhere. In Afghanistan, for instance, vast quantities of U.S.-supplied small arms and vehicles seeded regional black markets. Conflict Armament Research, a U.K. group that tracks conventional weapons, traced the Islamic State group’s ammunition stocks to dozens of countries — including U.S.-linked supply lines — often thanks to the chaos of collapsing units and unsecured stockpiles.

A recent Intercept investigation linked U.S manufactured rifle rounds to cartel slaughter in the heart of Mexico.

“The biggest concern for the average American citizen is the potential for these arms to be used against us,” said Brandon Philips, a public affairs professor at California State University, East Bay. “We are in a position right now where we aren’t everyone’s favorite country.”

When the government puts tracking systems in place, however, more of the leaks get plugged. In Ukraine — a challenging venue for containing arms flows because of the sheer quantity of material being introduced — early Pentagon watchdog reviews faulted shortfalls in tracking designated sensitive items amid an active war. Follow-ups found marked improvement as the U.S. expanded “enhanced end-use monitoring,” boosted staffing, and raised compliance rates.

Even with a partner government that has strong incentives to cooperate, effective control requires sustained, well-resourced checks. But the U.S doesn’t even have a system for how those checks should happen.

In its report, the GAO zeroed in on this vagueness. Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.

The ambiguity increases the odds that important cases fall into a bureaucratic void, never formally investigated or reported. The GAO even found examples where one incident drew a full document review and coordination, while a similar one drew no action at all.

“A number of us for years have talked about insufficiencies around end-of-use monitoring, and this report continues to show the problems of how this is done,” said Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank. “The American people are attuned that a lot of harm is caused in the world by our weapons.”

The infrastructure exists to track weapons — the State Department has systems to vet its direct buyers, and the Pentagon has a program for enhanced end-use monitoring. But the GAO found that the connective tissue of such programs doesn’t.

“The fact that this report is mostly about things that happened during the Biden administration, and the second part of Trump, shows it’s a systemic problem. It shows that we are going sell things and not bother,” said John Lindsay-Poland, coordinator of the nonprofit Stop U.S. Arms to Mexico. Poland noted that the report only covers a small portion of government-to-government sales, while the bulk of U.S. arms exports are commercial sales and small arms.

“If your priority is selling stuff,” he said, “taking into account whether the stuff you’re selling is massacring people, destroying communities, strengthening terrorists and drug trafficking, or driving immigration is secondary.”

Gaza and Double Standards

The GAO’s accounting of the oversight vacuum comes at an incendiary moment.

In 2024, the Biden administration put a policy in place that required assessments of whether partners receiving U.S. arms in active conflicts were using them consistent with international humanitarian law.

In May 2024, the administration’s report to Congress concluded it was “reasonable to assess” that Israel had used U.S.-provided arms in ways “inconsistent” with international law in some instances, while adding that wartime conditions made case-by-case attribution hard. Human rights groups blasted the equivocation and urged suspensions; Israel rejected the accusations.

In February 2025, the new administration scrapped the policy.

The Gaza debate is precisely where a functioning end-use system should be strongest.

Independent investigators and journalists have documented repeated Israeli strikes that allegedly used U.S.-origin munitions against protected sites or in ways that were indiscriminate. The State Department’s own human rights reporting, before becoming hollowed out this year under President Donald Trump, catalogued grave harms.

Abramson, who has tracked global armament and misuse, said failure to monitor end-use violations and report them to Congress can put American foreign policy in a diplomatic chokehold.

“Around the world,” he said, “we are trying to make friends, But when they have seen our weapons being misused it undermines that ability, and makes us seem hypocritical, dangerous.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240008789-e1760106927494.jpg?fit=3960%2C1980&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-10 16:57:31.867274

(KABC) -- An Altadena woman has been detained by ICE after her family says she went in for her annual check-in. They're now desperate for her to be released.

Riya Khan never imagined she'd be visiting her mother, Masuma, behind bars. The 64-year-old is being held at the California City Correctional Facility since her appointment Monday took an unexpected turn.

""She went in for her annual check-in and that's when she was detained and taken,"" her daughter said.

Masuma Khan, originally from Bangladesh, has no criminal history. She came to the U.S. on a visa in 1997 when her daughter fell ill while visiting family.

Two years later, she was eager to get a green card. Her daughter says her mother was taken advantage of by someone who claimed they could help.

""He took her money and he was gone. She never got any notices, she never got any letters to appear in court or anything so she was just unaware.""

Since 2015, the Khan family has been working with attorneys as Masuma's husband, who is a U.S. citizen, petitioned for her green card.

""She is making efforts to attempt to regularize her status, and it seems, at least on the surface, that the only reason she was taken in is a blanket policy of being more strict,"" said Steven Ridgill, an attorney for the family.

That policy is adding insult to injury for the Khan family, who live in Altadena and were temporarily displaced for months following the Eaton Fire.

Their future is once again uncertain as Masuma's family grows increasingly worried for her health while she remains detained without vital medications.

The Trump administration has, however, filed an appeal to that ruling.

The decision from U.S. District Judge April Perry was in response to a lawsuit filed this week by Chicago and Illinois and marked a temporary win for the city and state's Democratic leaders. It comes as President Donald Trump works to move troops into major urban areas, arguing they have a rampant crime crisis, despite statistics not always backing that up. Troops were expected to start patrolling Friday in Tennessee, and a court battle continued over Trump's plans to deploy them in Portland, Oregon.

But what will happen to the hundreds of troops already in Illinois, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, remained unclear.

In U.S. District Judge April Perry's ruling, she said the administration violated the 10th Amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th Amendment, which assures due process and equal protection.

The judge said the order would expire Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. She set an Oct. 22 hearing by telephone to determine if the order should be extended for another 14 days.

State and city leaders celebrated the decision, including Gov. JB Pritzker, who said: “The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago.""

Local

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said they plan to take to the case to higher courts.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

Perry heard arguments in a crowded downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

She pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show a significant recent drop in crime.

Perry referenced Alexander Hamilton in condemning the president’s actions.

“(The founders) would never believe that it would ever come to pass that one state militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” she said.

Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

It marks the second major ruling surrounding Chicago immigration enforcement.

In a separate hearing, federal agents were ordered — temporarily — by a federal judge to wear badges and were banned from using certain riot control weapons against peaceful protesters and journalists outside the Broadview ICE facility.

The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis restricts agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

KATU reached out to ICE for additional information about the arrests.

Portland police have increased presence

There was a noticeable increase in the number of Portland police officers Thursday.

Protesters like Bianca Barrett took notice of the increased presence by Portland police.

""Yes, it definitely got a lot more aggressive and more cars and like patrols and bike police,"" she said.

One man, who would only give his first name, Horace, was a counter-protester from Illinois. He thought Portland police are taking sides.

""Sometimes I feel like they do let stuff get out of hand on some occasions. They don't pay attention that much to situations,"" he said.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day told reporters earlier there is ""no cover-up or collaboration.""

""Our job doesn't change. It's the same today as it was yesterday as it was six months ago,"" he said.

According to Portland police, officers have made 47 arrests since the protest began in June. Twenty-eight of those were in June.

Day said the police bureau has increased enforcement.

""So we have more officers in the area. We're also working closely with the state police,"" he said.

The lawsuit brought in federal court in Colorado alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are arresting and detaining people because of their skin color, accent or perceived nationality to fulfill arrest quotas set by the Trump administration without determining probable cause and flight risk.

The firms are bringing the lawsuit on behalf of four people, including Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah student who was brought to the U.S. as a child. ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County Sheriff deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status. She spent 15 days in ICE’s Aurora detention center.

“Our state’s 169,000 undocumented immigrants, and hundreds of thousands more Latine Coloradans, now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the lawsuit said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

The lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Colorado, Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, names three defendants: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons and Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office Robert Guadian.

ICE’s Denver Field Office referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE agents must have probable cause to believe the person they are arresting is living in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs in the case say they were arrested indiscriminately. All reported experiencing physical injuries, pain and hunger during their arrests or while in detention, according to the lawsuit.

Refugio Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father and lawful permanent resident who has lived in Colorado for 20 years and is the father of four U.S. citizen children. ICE agents in unmarked cars pulled him over in May when he was on his way to work in Grand Junction at the construction concrete company where he has worked for 18 years. ICE held him at the detention center in Aurora for more than 90 days, according to the lawsuit.

A 36-year-old asylum seeker identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. has lived in Colorado for 15 years. On Feb. 5, ICE agents raided the Whispering Pines Apartments complex, where he had lived for seven years. At the time, J.S.T. was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job at a restaurant and grocery store when ICE agents arrested him. He spent four weeks at the Aurora detention center and lost his home as a result, according to the lawsuit.

That same day ICE agents conducted raids in at least seven apartment complexes and communities across Denver, Aurora, and Thornton, the lawsuit said. At some apartments, ICE agents knocked on every door, the lawsuit alleges, asking tenants to provide identification without a warrant.

A 32-year-old father and construction business owner identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver for a friend. G.R.R. spent seven weeks at the Aurora detention center, according to the lawsuit.

“Plaintiffs and their families were devastated by the unlawful captures and now live every day in a heightened state of fear of again being separated,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to consider the plaintiffs as representatives of a class of all people in Colorado who have been arrested since Jan. 20, 2025, or will be arrested without a warrant and without “a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk.”

The lawsuit describes the similar experience of many other people whom ICE has arrested since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to deport “vicious and bloodthirsty criminals,” but also promised to execute “the largest deportation program in American history.” The resulting roundups of immigrants working in fields, attending court hearings or walking in their neighborhoods have included those with work permits, permanent residency cards and even U.S. citizenship.

In May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said, “we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” after reports from other news outlets that Miller and Noem had set the daily arrest quota. The administration later disavowed the quota after running into questions from federal judges about its constitutionality.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSCF2614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:57:24.404854

In campaign speeches, press conferences, and executive orders, President Donald Trump has relentlessly vilified Latin American immigrants as criminals, invaders, and burdens on the U.S. economy.[i] He has declared a “national emergency” at the southern border to justify authoritarian power grabs, deployed troops and razor wire against asylum-seekers, and fast-tracked deportations to countries like El Salvador — stripping people of due process and ignoring well-documented risks to their lives and safety.[ii] These tactics are not about border security; they are about scapegoating vulnerable people to obscure deeper systemic failure as corporations cash in.

As Trump and other politicians use immigration as a political weapon, the real crisis goes unexamined: the economic system that displaces people through trade and investment policies, exploits their labor upon arrival, and criminalizes their existence.

“This fight is ours, it’s our community’s, but it belongs to everyone. We all have to fight for them.” -David Huerta, President of the Service Employees International Union California. Original photo: David Crane, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG.

The consequences are felt beyond the border. Within communities, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is detaining Spanish-speaking American citizens, sweeping up Native Americans in immigration raids, and even deporting U.S. citizens.[iii] This targeting stems from hate-fueled bias, and a recent Supreme Court ruling has effectively sanctioned racial profiling and the unjust treatment of individuals whose only “crime” is their heritage.[iv]

Trump’s criminalization of migrants does nothing to address the U.S. economic policies that displace people across Latin America and extract profit at every step of their journey. Instead, it lines the pockets of a powerful corporate lobby: the private prison industry.

In his second term, President Trump has directed his administration to intensify its efforts to crack down on immigration. In the early days of the administration, ICE arrests averaged around 660 daily, but just four months later, the agency arrested a record 2,300 individuals in a single day.[v] White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made clear the administration’s goal is to increase arrests to 3,000 per day.[vi]

Detainment operations, conducted with militarized tactics and unmarked vehicles, have sparked widespread peaceful protests. In Los Angeles, community resistance was met with an unprecedented deployment of federal troops. The raids have affected diverse communities such as garment workers, day laborers, and local businesses, leading to mass arrests and heightened community unrest.[vii]

Private Prisons: Cashing In on Detained Migrants

The Trump administration’s xenophobic campaign rhetoric and ensuing ICE raids have proven highly profitable for private prison companies, especially GEO Group and CoreCivic. Since Trump took office, their stock value soared — GEO Group’s by 35% and CoreCivic’s by 57%.[viii] Their financial success is intricately linked to Trump’s policies, particularly his rescission of a Biden-era order aimed at reducing the use of private prisons.[ix] These companies run detention centers and create surveillance technology to monitor immigrants, capitalizing on the mass deportation strategy.

Lobbying

GEO Group and CivicCore have aggressively lobbied to expand immigration enforcement and detention to boost their revenue. Between 2008 and 2014, they collectively spent over $16 million on federal lobbying, targeting the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees immigration detention funding and policies.[x]

In 2017, during Trump’s first administration, GEO Group significantly increased its lobbying expenditures, spending $1.7 million — a more than 70% increase from the previous year — to influence policies related to immigration enforcement and detention. This marked the highest amount on record for a private prison contractor at the time.[xi]

In 2024, GEO Group reportedly spent $1.38 million, and CoreCivic allocated $1.77 million to federal lobbying, continuing their efforts to influence immigration and detention policies.[xii] In the first quarter of 2025 alone, GEO Group invested $350,000, while CoreCivic spent $490,000 on lobbying efforts.[xiii] These expenditures help secure favorable government policies that align with their business interests.

Government Contracts

That lobbying has paid off. Following its surge in lobbying in 2017, GEO Group announced it had won the Trump administration’s first federal contract for a new immigration detention center: a $110 million, 1,000-bed facility in Conroe, Texas.[xiv] GEO Group and CoreCivic have continued to benefit directly from mass deportation efforts, securing lucrative ICE contracts to run detention centers and provide detention beds. GEO Groups secured $747 million in contracts in 2023 alone, and CoreCivic received an ICE contract worth $2.2 billion, representing 30% of its total revenue.[xv]

The companies’ profit model thrives on the detention of immigrants, with “bed quotas” mandating a minimum number of immigration detention beds, thus ensuring a steady demand for facilities.[xvi] This “bed quota” policy, which guarantees payment of $150 per detainee per day, is funded by taxpayer dollars.[xvii] This financial incentive to maintain high incarceration rates further fuels the cycle of mass detention, as private interests profit from the very policies that fuel the raids targeting the displaced.

Revolving Door

The revolving door between government officials and high-ranking roles within companies raises serious ethical concerns. For example, Pam Bondi, Trump’s Attorney General, previously lobbied for GEO Group.[xviii] Most recently, David Bible, a top ICE official, left his position to become Executive Vice President at GEO Group, shortly after advocating for more funding to expand detention capacity and technology to monitor migrants — efforts that directly benefited his future employer.[xix]

Forced Labor and Inhumane Conditions

A key element of the profit-driven model is the exploitation of detainees as cheap labor. GEO Group, which operates 16 ICE detention facilities, has faced multiple lawsuits over inhumane labor practices, including forcing detainees to prepare meals, wash laundry, and scrub toilets for just $1 per day.[xx]

Forcing detainees to do this work for so little avoids the costs associated with hiring paid employees. A federal court ruled that GEO must pay $17 million in back wages, plus $6 million for “unjust enrichment” — still accounting for less than 1% of GEO’s total revenues in 2024.[xxi] Nevertheless, GEO Group is refusing to pay and vowing to “vigorously pursue all available appeals.”[xxii]

Detainees spell “SOS” during a protest against inhumane conditions in the courtyard of ICE’s Krome Detention Center in Florida, 2025. Original photo: Paul Ratje/Reuters.

The company has also faced numerous lawsuits for mistreating detainees, including children.[xxiii] These conditions include moldy food, solitary confinement, and severe medical neglect, resulting in preventable deaths.[xxiv]

In 2023, GEO Group was sued for using toxic chemicals to clean its facilities, causing detainees to fall ill and suffer long-term health consequences.[xxv] Such inhumane conditions are unacceptable under any circumstances. Importantly, migrants detained in ICE centers are not criminals. They are held in legal limbo while an immigration judge determines whether they should be deported.

Booming Business

As the mass detainment of migrants following ICE raids intensifies, the financial incentives of this punitive system become increasingly apparent as corporations that house detained migrants profit from human suffering, funded by taxpayer dollars.[xxvi]

In 2022, the GEO Group reported $4 billion, accounting for approximately 43% of its revenue, from ICE contracts.[xxvii] This revenue stream has only grown as demand for detention space surges under the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. In 2025, CoreCivic signed a new contract with ICE to expand its detention capacity, accommodating up to 784 additional detainees at correctional facilities that the company runs in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma, including a maximum-security prison.[xxviii]

Criminalizing migrants does not protect national security — it protects corporate profits. It sustains a system in which workers displaced by trade are penalized for surviving, and where their legal precarity is exploited as a tool of wage suppression.

Our officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.

Harassment at home: In September, three women were indicted by a federal grand jury for livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home and then posting the victim’s home address on Instagram. Upon arriving at the law enforcement officer’s home, they began shouting “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here,” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

Direct threats to families: In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

When agents and their families are identified, they receive violent threats in their messages and even death threats. One agent’s spouse was sent this Facebook message by Robert Buckley of Lakeville, Massachusetts: “Your husband, the ICE man is a f*** and retribution will come your way eventually.”

Doxxing online: An investigation by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility in San Diego led to the arrest of Gregory John Curcio, 68, who is accused of doxxing an ICE attorney by posting her personal information online and urging others to harass her. Court documents allege in February 2025, Curcio posted the attorney’s home address to social media and directed others to “swat” her; a tactic involving false emergency calls to provoke an armed law enforcement response.

In recent weeks, public demonstrations and policy debates have surged, highlighting concerns over the legal status of undocumented youth in Canada. With immigration a key topic, the push for inclusive policies is gaining momentum across North America.

The Push for DACA Canada Immigration Reform

Advocacy groups across Canada are intensifying their efforts for DACA immigration reform. The growing political and public interest stems from recent discussions about immigrant rights and legal protections. These groups are calling for policies that reflect Canada’s values of inclusivity and diversity. Research shows that an inclusive approach can lead to better social and economic outcomes, benefiting the country as a whole. In the past month, several rallies have taken place in major Canadian cities, drawing attention to the plight of undocumented youth. These events aim to galvanize public support and influence policymakers. Experts argue that reforming immigration policies not only upholds human rights but also enhances Canada’s international image. This push is part of a larger movement to align North American policies on immigration.

Challenges in Canadian Immigration Policy

While advocacy efforts intensify, challenges remain in reforming Canadian immigration policy. Current policies often leave undocumented youth without clear legal status or pathways to citizenship. This uncertainty impacts their access to education and employment, creating barriers to full participation in society. Recent reports indicate that over 200,000 undocumented people are residing in Canada, many of whom arrived as children. Advocacy groups stress that reform is crucial to address these pressing issues. Legal experts also point to the need for clearer frameworks that protect the rights of all residents, including the undocumented. Enhanced legal status would provide much-needed security for these individuals and their families.

How the Immigrant Rights Movement Influences Policy

The immigrant rights movement in Canada has gained traction as more people advocate for comprehensive reform. Social media has played a significant role in spreading awareness and initiating conversations about DACA and immigration policy. Platforms like X and Reddit have become hubs for discussion, where advocates share strategies and highlight personal stories. For instance, a recent report shows how these advocacy efforts are starting to influence political agendas. Politicians are increasingly acknowledging the need for policy adjustments to reflect Canada’s commitment to human rights. By leveraging public and policy support, the immigrant rights movement continues to pave the way for meaningful changes.

Conclusion: The Way Forward for DACA and Immigration Reform

Looking ahead, the momentum for DACA and immigration reform in Canada seems strong. Advocacy groups are rallying support not only from immigrants but also from broader communities. These efforts highlight an increasing awareness that inclusive immigration policies are vital for social cohesion and economic prosperity. Moreover, as Canada positions itself as a leader in human rights and inclusivity, aligning immigration policies with these values becomes imperative. The focus now is on translating public support into legislative action, so undocumented youth and immigrants can secure their future. Change may not be immediate, but each step taken by advocacy groups, individuals, and policymakers contributes to a more just and equitable system. Canada’s journey towards reforming immigration policy underscores a commitment to diversity and inclusion, offering hope for those who seek certainty and belonging.

Final Thoughts

As advocacy groups in Canada push for reform, attention is turning to the impact of uncertain legal status on undocumented youth. Their efforts emphasize the need for policies that reflect Canada’s commitment to inclusivity and human rights. As awareness grows, so does the potential for meaningful change in immigration policy. It’s crucial for lawmakers to heed the call for reform, providing pathways to legal status that ensure the well-being of all residents. This ongoing movement offers hope for a more inclusive future.

Friday morning's demonstration got underway after a federal judge granted the state's temporary restraining order, barring National Guards troops from taking part in immigration operations.

That TRO is in effect for two weeks and could be extended.

Chopper 7 captured dozens of National Guard members gathering outside the Army Reserve training facility in far southwest suburban Elwood on Friday morning.

Judge April Perry's decision came hours after the Guard arrived at the Broadview immigration facility on Thursday. Troops could be seen walking around and lingering near the facility.

The Trump administration has argued that the bolstered military presence is needed to protect federal property and employees. But the judge said the government's claims about an out-of-control public on the brink of rebellion were not credible.

The White House responded to the judge's move to grant a temporary restraining order, writing, in part, ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement, saying, ""President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Chicago following violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxed by left-wing rioters. The President's lawful actions will make Chicago safer. We have the law and supremacy clause on our side.""

Judge rules fencing surrounding Broadview ICE facility must come down

Meanwhile, a judge has ordered the removal of a fence surrounding the Broadview facility.

Attorneys for the federal government argued that the fencing across Beach Street was needed to conduct business and to protect vehicles and personnel, after conflicts erupted during protests of ICE action during operation ""Midway Blitz.""

The village of Broadview said the fence was put up without village approval, and it blocks emergency response.

The judge sided with Broadview officials, granting their request for a TRO.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued a statement, saying, ""This is a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety. The judge's decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview's ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders. The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.""

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.
In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.
G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience.
In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.
Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.
And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said.","To say bluntly what was on most every mind here, it’s entirely plausible that Britain, Germany and France are led by far-right nationalist parties by the end of the decade, and it’s not clear the traditional parties and leaders know how to stop it from happening.

But before we consider that jarring future, let’s dip into the past.

In one respect, the Tory conclave had the “It’s a Wonderful Life” feel of an alternative past in the U.S., had Trump lost the primary or general election in 2016 and created his own populist splinter party.

Republicans before 2016 longed for another Reagan, decorating their conferences with his image and even cardboard cutouts, and surely would have continued to do so had Trump not taken over the party. So it was no surprise that Thatcher’s name was emblazoned on one of the conference forums, her dresses and campaign posters were on display and, yes, there was even a cardboard cutout of the Iron Lady.

Even the venue had the air of yesterday, taking place beneath the bones of Manchester’s renovated old central train station.

Swap out ill-fitting suits and missing collar stays for Barbour and tweed and this could have been a CPAC or RNC meeting in a world where Trump doesn’t define the modern Republican Party.

Beyond the nostalgia for what was — and airbrushing out of more recent, inconvenient party leaders — the Conservative leaders and rhetoric reflected the course Republicans surely would have taken had Trump walked. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch used her speech on the conference’s opening day to denounce identity politics from both flanks, Labour on their left, and the right-wing party that’s supplanted the Tories: Nigel Farage’s Reform.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience. “I am British, conference, I am British, as we all are.”

It doesn’t require much imagination to envision a Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio delivering their version of that same speech as they jockeyed to lead a non-Trump GOP after 2016.

Yet it’s what Badenoch said next that illustrates how desperate Conservatives here are to catch up with Farage’s Reform, which has made a hardline on migration its calling card. In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.

“Yes, Britain is a multiracial country,” Badenoch said. “That is part of our modern story. But it must never become a multicultural country where shared values dissolve, loyalty fragments and we foment the home-grown terrorism we saw on the streets of Manchester this week.”

Badenoch was alluding to the terrorist attack on a local synagogue on Yom Kippur, a tragedy which prompted a show of security that took longtime conference-goers by surprise. Manchester police wielding long guns were ubiquitous, and one of the officers told me that, until last week, his force hadn’t fired a service weapon in the line of duty for 14 years.

The incident has only accelerated the pressure Conservatives feel to keep pace with Reform here and Trumpism abroad, a task Tories have nobody to blame for but themselves, given the soaring migration that took place on their government’s watch following Brexit. The urgency was made clear on the conference’s opening day when Badenoch explicitly modeled her deportation proposal after ICE and even included a Stephen Miller-level quota by vowing to deport 150,000 migrants a year.

But why would Britons who are animated by immigration support the lite beer version of what Farage is offering when they can vote for full-bodied Reform? More challenging for the Tories in the UK’s multi-party system is that their lurch right isn’t cost-free. While they strain to slow the exodus of hard-liners to Reform by proposing an ICE-style crackdown, they lose more of their moderates to the centrist Liberal Democrats. It’s not hard to grasp why the governing party of the previous 14 years is in danger of not even claiming third today when you see how they’re being eaten away from the middle and far-right.

More to the point, Badenoch can attempt a third way-style criticism of the identity politics of both extremes, but the inescapable fact is that many would-be Conservative voters grow more enamored with right-wing identity politics when somebody named Jihad al-Shamie drives a car into pedestrians outside a synagogue and then stabs Jews celebrating the highest of holy days. And if that wasn’t apparent, then the crowds that racist rabble rouser Tommy Robinson are drawing to his rallies — with Elon Musk cameos! — should make it blazingly obvious. Which is to say nothing of the ever more frequent display of the British flag, a topic of frequent discussion here as some argue it’s being used to sow discord.

The famous former Manchester United footballer, Gary Neville, caused a stir this week by saying “the Union Jack flag being used in a negative fashion is not right” and lamenting the division being “created by angry middle-aged white men, who know exactly what they’re doing.”

Well, one of the middle-aged white men whom Neville clearly had in mind, Farage, emphatically does know what he’s doing. And he responded with a rejoinder video that has already racked up over 1.5 million views on Twitter. The Reform leader said Neville was insulting the sort of Brits who watch the athlete-turned-telecaster on Sky Sports — the same people “who pay his wages” — rather than faulting the real source of division: an “evil, crazed, mad Islamist.”

To say that Farage’s counter-attack on a Man U legend moved more quickly into the British bloodstream than, say, Badenoch vowing to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights is like saying images of Trump at that McDonald’s drive-thru got more attention than Kamala Harris’s campaign-concluding speech on the Ellipse. In other words, the Tories are using conventional weapons against Farage’s nuclear warheads.

Revealingly, the old guard is trying to mimic some of the same language that has vaulted Farage to the de facto leader of the opposition.

When The Guardian reported that top shadow minister, Robert Jenrick, had complained that he “didn’t see another white face” when he visited an area in Birmingham, lamenting he didn’t want to live in such a country, one of his Conservative colleagues defended him. “We’re a majority white country,” said Claire Coutinho, a shadow minister whose parents were Indian immigrants. “If you walk through an area and don’t see a single white face, it is a sign that integration has failed.”

Privately, Tories sound a lot like those less-than-MAGA Republicans explaining that, look, voters want this from us. As one Conservative told my colleagues this week, “The Overton Window has shifted” on immigration.

Yet that doesn’t mean they’re fully comfortable with the shift.

Sitting for separate interviews in the POLITICO Pub during the conference, two of the party’s most prominent shadow ministers shied away from the ICE comparison when it was posed directly to them.

“The way they do their border security is for them,” said shadow housing secretary James Cleverly, alluding to Americans.

“America’s model is very different,” said Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary.

Interviews with former members of Parliament turned up more hope than much of a plan. Farage wasn’t offering realistic solutions and, once faced with the real prospect of him as prime minister, surely Britons wouldn’t elect such a character — right?

“The big problem that Reform has is that, while they can definitely benefit from exasperation with the whole scene of the moment, by the time we come to the next election, it’ll be a job of work to do, and I don’t think that they will have demonstrated that they either have the team or the ability necessary given the scale of the challenge,” Michael Gove, the former minister in a series of Conservative governments, told me.

Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.

“They’ve got left-wing labourites supporting socialist economic policies and those on the far-right because of immigration,” said Mortimer.

To my ear, after 10 years of watching Trump, it all sounded quite familiar.

The most realistic assessment was the one that Democrats in the U.S. should pay heed to: that the only way to defuse populism is for traditional parties to show an interest in and aptitude for the issues voters want addressed. And for all the talk about making the economy work again, voters here couldn’t be clearer that it is identity (and therefore immigration) that they’re focused on.

If Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is able to bring order to the immigration process, that could drain some of the energy out of an issue that right now would vault Farage to Number 10.

“It depends on whether this government can make any progress,” is how Mark Harper put it when I asked him if immigration would be as central in the next general election, likely in 2029, as it is now.

As he pulled a frothy, pre-noon brew from the POLITICO Pub tap, Cleverly, who lost on the final ballot to be party leader in the Tories’ general election defeat last year, acknowledged that “disillusionment in the public is a real problem” across western democracies.

There is, he said, “this real desire for simple answers to complicated questions,” and populist parties like Reform here or the AFD in Germany or the National Rally in France are offering simple answers.

And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said. “But wanting it harder, mate, is not a policy. That’s where it falls down.”

Looming over the conference — the demanding Ghost of Christmas Present to Thatcher’s inviting Ghost of Christmas Past — was Farage.

And his answer to the proceedings, to Cleverly and company’s demand for hard answers and specifics, was succinct.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc9%2F8f%2Fcfae60cc43329d049cbf09bffed9%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2239929394,N,,2025-10-10 11:59:55.505580

When Mimi Lettunich, a family friend with powerful social connections in Portland, Oregon, learned of their disappearance, she spared no effort to locate the immigrant mother and her four U.S. citizen children.

It would take another eight days — and an unorthodox road trip by a hands-on member of Congress — before the Trump administration would even disclose where it was holding the family. And it would be four days after that before the children were released to Lettunich and set free from conditions likened in a congressional hearing to “psychological torture.”

The story of Jackie Merlos is singular and conscience-shocking. “They literally disappeared her — kept her from due process in the presence of her four U.S. citizen children,” Rep. Maxine Dexter, who serves Portland in Congress, tells Rolling Stone. But her experience is also emblematic of the full-throttle mass-deportation machinery put into motion by the Trump administration. “Our government is kidnapping people,” Dexter says, “and holding them in incredibly inhumane situations.”

The Merlos family nightmare began, ironically, with a hug, at Peace Arch Park.

Kenia Jackeline “Jackie” Merlos is the mother of four children under the age of 10. Although she arrived undocumented from Honduras more than two decades ago, Jackie was a model non-citizen, with a pending U-visa, a work permit, and no criminal record. She and her husband Carlos own a small business in Portland. Jackie had been the worship director in her church.

For the Merlos family, early summer was a season of reunion: Jackie’s parents had flown to the United States on valid tourist visas. With her mom, Juana, and her four kids, Jackie drove from Portland to the U.S.-Canada border for the afternoon of June 28 to have a picnic with Jackie’s sister, Flor, and her family, legal residents of Canada.

Peace Arch Park sits astride the border, near Vancouver. Maintained by both British Columbia and Washington state, the park doesn’t have a clearly delineated boundary between the two countries, and it has long functioned as a neutral space for cross-border reunions and international exchange. (During the pandemic, cross-border lovers canoodled in the park without attending to international quarantine controls.)

Editor’s picks

The Merlos family picnic took a devastating turn when Flor was giving goodbye hugs to her relatives. The family was intercepted by Customs and Border Patrol agents, who claimed Flor had crossed illegally into the United States. The CPB agents took the whole clan into custody. A spokesperson for CBP told Rolling Stone in a statement that its agents “arrested Kenia Jackeline Merlos at Peace Arch Park as she attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States.”

To Jackie’s advocates, this notion is nonsense. Jackie’s father and her husband, Carlos, had remained in Portland because there wasn’t room in the family car for more passengers. “If you’re smuggling somebody, you’re certainly not bringing your four young children and your elderly mother,” Lettunich tells Rolling Stone.

The government never brought smuggling charges against anyone. Flor and her kids were soon released back to Canada. Jackie’s mother Juana, despite her tourist visa, was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. But Jackie and her four children disappeared into off-the-grid federal custody, while the Trump administration attempted to speed-run their removal from the United States.

The family remained hidden from friends, a lawyer hired on their behalf, and even Rep. Dexter, who made it a mission to physically track down her missing constituents. In the meantime, Carlos, the children’s father, was also seized and detained by ICE. This story has been pieced together from congressional and court documents, interviews with Dexter and Lettunich, as well as comment from CPB.

The mistreatment of the Merlos family — and in particular the citizen children — offers context for why the ICE building in Portland has become a hotspot of local protest, and a focal point for Donald Trump’s militarized crackdown on dissent.

At a moment when anti-immigrant hysteria affects the highest levels of our national government, likely hundreds if not thousands of similar stories are unfolding outside of public scrutiny, as law abiding immigrants and even their citizen children are being torn from the fabric of their communities and unjustly exiled from America.

Mimi Lettunich runs a creative agency and lives in a wooded, modernist home in Portland’s prosperous West Hills, where she invited Rolling Stone for an interview in late September. She had known Jackie and Carlos for nearly 20 years; the couple’s firm had done work on a remodel of Lettunich’s home, and the two women became fast friends. “Jackie and I are like sisters,” she says.

When Jackie and her children were first detained, Lettunich had been out of town attending to a death in the family. She returned home July 2 to news that her friends were missing. “I talked to Carlos that evening,” Lettunich recalls. For the Merlos family, the nightmare was about to widen. “By the next morning he was taken,” she says of Carlos, by federal immigration agents.

The following days, encompassing the 4th of July holiday, were a blur. “We started calling everybody we could. We got an attorney. We got some national groups involved. And we started navigating the chaos of the immigration system,” Lettunich says. “Make a phone call. Somebody tells you to call somebody else. You call — it’s a dead end. It’s very challenging. I feel horrible for people that don’t have other resources,” she says. “How they’re finding their loved ones has gotta be just a nightmare.”

The days ticked by. Jackie and her children didn’t turn up through any of the online locator tools maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Lettunich reached out to Rep. Dexter through a mutual friend to see if the congresswoman — newly elected in 2024 — could help.

Dexter was all in. The freshman legislator is a medical doctor who has carved out a lane in Congress fighting for the due process rights of immigrants. Earlier this year she joined a congressional delegation that traveled to El Salvador demanding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from that nation’s foul gulag.

But even a member of Congress couldn’t get a straight answer from the Trump administration. “Nothing from CBP or ICE was helpful,” Dexter tells Rolling Stone. “They’re like, ‘We don’t know where they are. Maybe they’re in Blaine or Ferndale,’” she says, naming Washington state cities with immigrant detention facilities.

On Thursday, July 10, Dexter decided to take matters into her own hands. “Carrie, my chief, and I just got in the car, and we’re like, ‘We’re gonna go try to find them.’” As the congresswoman headed north, she and her staff were still gathering information, and leading a loose caravan up the interstate. “Mimi was a couple hours behind us.”

Dexter zeroed in on CPB lockups, because few ICE centers can hold children and they’re not supposed to hold U.S. citizens. By policy, CPB facilities are only supposed to hold detainees for 12 hours. “But it’s not illegal to do longer than that,” Dexter says. “And because Jackie was refusing to separate from her children, they couldn’t send her to an ICE facility. So they were caught in this sort of no man’s land, literally, near the border.”

Late in that afternoon, Dexter and her crew pulled up at the CPB facility in Ferndale, outside Bellingham, Washington, well north of Seattle. “We literally rang the bell. I said, ‘I’m Congresswoman Maxine Dexter. I’m here looking for a family.” The representative was told she’d have to wait for the arrival of the facility supervisor. Dexter persisted: “Can you just tell us if we’re in the right place? And he was like, ‘Yes, you are.’”

“That’s the first time somebody was recognizing that they had custody of these kids and their mom,” she says.

Dexter alone was allowed to enter the lockup, without her phone, to see where her constituents were jailed. “It’s a windowless cell to the outside,” she recalls. “But there’s a soundproof glass window that the guards can look through. There’s no privacy at all. The lights go on and off all night long.” The cell had a toilet, a “tiny sink,” and a cement bench. “They were the only people at this detention facility. They don’t have food facilities, they don’t have shower facilities. It is not meant for long term detention.” The conditions looked dismal: “There were a few mats on the floor and a couple blankets,” Dexter says. “They had been there 12 days at that point.”

The member of Congress wasn’t allowed to communicate with Jackie. She could only wave, as the mother sat on the floor with her children, praying. “Jackie had no idea who I was, or that we were trying to help her. She didn’t know if her family knew where they were. This is happening on our watch,” Dexter says. “With our taxpayer dollars.”

Attempting to talk sense into the officials in the scene, Dexter objected to the jailing of the Merlos children, insisting: “They didn’t do anything wrong. You can’t just detain them.” The officials countered that Jackie wouldn’t let herself be separated. “Would you?” Dexter shot back. “You don’t know if you’ll ever get to see your kids again.”

“I’m a mother,” she tells Rolling Stone during an interview from her district office in a federal building in Portland. “I wouldn’t agree to have my kids removed from me either.”

Locating Jackie and the children didn’t end the drama. Federal authorities were still attempting to rush the family out of the country. Dexter had arrived on a Thursday, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next day she presented again at the facility with Jackie’s attorney. But the family was already being moved around by federal authorities, who were pressing forward with a plan to remove Jackie and the kids from the country. “They put them in a van and went to Portland to go try to find the paperwork that they needed to get them passports,” Dexter says.

The government claimed that Jackie had signed an order for voluntary removal — but would not produce that paperwork, even for Dexter. The children didn’t have passports, and to obtain them the government needed their father’s consent. Jackie’s team soon learned the government had taken pictures of the children to the ICE detention center in Tacoma where Carlos was being held, and had him sign documents verifying these were his offspring. “They showed him photos of each of his kids, and said, ‘Is this your child? Yes? Sign this form,’” says Dexter. “It was the form to get them passports.”

For Jakie’s advocates, it was time to pull out all the stops. Dexter dressed down the Congressional Affairs liaison for CBP, warning him that effectuating the involuntary removal of four American citizens would be an “enormous illegal maneuver, and I, as a member of Congress, will not stand silent on that.” Simultaneously, Jackie’s lawyer filed a request for a temporary restraining order in federal court to block Jackie and her children from leaving the country.

That restraining order came through Monday morning, with the judge detailing that Jackie had been “serially re-located and denied contact with counsel” in ruling to block her removal from the court’s jurisdiction. The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.

Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie’s kids. “I got a call the day we got the TRO,” Lettunich recalls. “They say, ‘We have the Merlos children. Would you like to come get them?” It was the first time the idea had been floated, and suddenly the government was behaving, Lettunich says, as if the children had just wrapped up a play date. “Come get them.” Lettunich rushed to the pickup at SeaTac airport. ”I still didn’t get to see Jackie, but we picked up four children — with four new passports.”

Rolling Stone reached out to the Department of Homeland Security with a detailed list of questions about the Merlos family’s experience. A CPB spokesperson responded with a brief emailed statement about Jackie: “At her request, her children initially remained with her in CBP custody. She is now in ICE custody, and formal removal proceedings are underway.” The statement adds: “For clarity, DHS does not deport U.S. citizens. In cases involving minors, parents are given the choice to accompany their children during removal proceedings, or alternatively, to have the children placed with a designated guardian of the parent’s choosing.”

In the car with Lettunich, the kids revealed a secret. “Mimi, Mom wrote you a note.” One of the children had left the facility with a coloring book provided by the feds. On the first page was a handwritten note to Lettunich offering thanks and parenting pointers — asking that the kids be careful near the swimming pool and noting an upcoming orthodontist appointment. “I will miss my babies. Please take care of them. This is so hard,” Jackie wrote, adding: “We are on God’s hand.”

Lettunich and her husband were aspiring empty nesters. “I have two boys. They’re both drinking age,” she says. In her mid 50s, Lettunich has now been vaulted back into caregiving for nine-year-old triplets — two boys and a girl — and one younger brother, seven. The children share a bedroom, and have the run of the lower floor of the Lettunich home, which has a basketball hoop and a life-size sculpture of a bull by the covered pool.

Debriefing the children from the traumatic experience of their incarceration, Lettunich learned that they had been questioned by federal agents, away from their mother. She testified to this in an unsworn “shadow” congressional hearing held by Democrats in Washington D.C. in mid-September. Lettunich denounced “the state sponsored abuse the children endured.” As she described it, “Agents interrogated the children without Jackie. They were asked: Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have relatives? Did they have a father? Shortly thereafter, ICE took their dad,” Lettunich said. “The children believed that was their fault.”

Jackie is now being held in an ICE facility where she can be reached by phone and is an active part of the children’s parenting. “They talk every day,” says Lettunich. The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they’ve been raised. That said,” she adds, “they’re in trauma. They’re seeing a psychologist. A couple of them have night constant nightmares.”

The four children have their clothes and possessions organized in a tidy series of bins with their names on them, spaced throughout their bedroom, and on shelves in the closet. Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents.

Here is also taped a handwritten note from Jackie to her children, in Spanish, decorated with an array of small pink hearts. “Pardon me for not being there,” it reads, promising the children that she is saving up all the hugs and little kisses she has not been able to give them directly. “What’s happening to us won’t last a lifetime,” Jackie adds. “I only ask, my children, that you be patient and that we trust in God that the best is yet to come.”

Jackie has so far been denied release, and her next court date is October 14. After weeks in detention, her mother, Juana, was finally set free in late September, telling The Oregonian: “I’m so traumatized that I have nightmares that I’m still there.” As detailed on the family’s Go Fund Me page, Carlos lost his own hearing in early October. Lettunich tells Rolling Stone he was deported to Honduras on October 7. “It’s hard to be optimistic,” she admits.

Dexter holds up the Merlos family story against the promises of Trump and his administration to to target violent offenders and drug dealers for deportation. “This story is so egregious and so cruel — and so clearly not what the American people thought Donald Trump was going to be doing,” she says. “He said he was going after the ‘worst of the worst’ — and cleaning up crime and getting fentanyl out of our communities.”

Perez, who was arrested in February, admitted to using his position to smuggle people across the border illegally, accept bribes, and traffic cocaine.

Prosecutors revealed that his criminal activities dated back to November 2019.

RELATED:

Perez was arrested at the Paso Del Norte Bridge in downtown El Paso, where investigators say the timeline of alleged offenses begins in December 2023 when he allowed a gray Nissan Pathfinder to cross the border multiple times to smuggle undocumented migrants for money.

The same vehicle reportedly passed through the entry point again in January, May, and August of 2024, each time with undocumented migrants.

In November 2024, Perez allegedly permitted the vehicle to enter with three undocumented migrants, including two adults and a minor.

The charges he pleaded guilty to carry significant prison sentences:

Drug trafficking could result in 10 years to life

Human smuggling up to five years

Bribery of a public official up to 15 years

Prosecutors stated that Perez accepted:

Over $700,000 in bribes

A black massage chair

A Rolex watch

Assorted jewelry

$3,884

He also helped smuggle more than 250 migrants and conspired to distribute over 32 kilograms of cocaine, which ended up in North Carolina and Louisiana.

RECOMMENDED:

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said,

To traffic drugs and smuggle humans while wearing the badge is not only a disgusting betrayal of our patriotic Customs and Border Protection officers but of our nation and the American people. Manuel Perez will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

CBP declined a request for an interview, however, they provided the following statement:

CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission, and the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. We defer to the office of the U.S. Attorney for anything further on this matter.

When helicopters descended on a Chicago apartment building last week with federal agents kitted out in military gear, locals saw a terrifying escalation in the federal government’s incursion into Chicago.

Department of Homeland Security officials saw a cinematic opportunity for a “Call of Duty”-style recruiting video with images from helmet cameras and dramatic music.

Flush with money from Republicans in Congress and on a hiring spree, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs to recruit a lot of people.

It also wants to send a message to immigrants, as it did with a more traditional international ad campaign earlier this year. The message is stay out of the US and leave if you’re here.

From the DHS side of the camera lens, there are videos like the one with the hunting or military-style tag line “Bag it. Tag it. Take it down,.”

The behind-the-scenes versions are on CCTV, like this post from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute immigration expert David Bier, a critic of the administration, that shows agents, with a masked photographer in tow, sprinting after unidentified men who had been drinking coffee on the corner.

These videos borrow from the wartime Uncle Sam posters of yore to call for recruits as it has relaxed standards, waiving age requirements and offering a $50,000 signing bonus to bring in new people. And its videos might be intended to entice a certain type of young adult into the federal service.

At the same time, the underlying events behind the videos today could be traumatizing kids, including US citizens, who find themselves on the business end of raids.

“Imagine being a child wakened in the middle of the night by a Blackhawk helicopter on your roof,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a news conference on Tuesday, as he complained about federal agents arriving with camera crews in tow.

Not the first propaganda films

The videos also dovetail with a long line of US government wartime propaganda efforts, albeit with a harder edge than Rosie the Riveter. During World War II, the Hollywood director Frank Capra produced a series of “Why We Fight” films in order to boost morale and instill loyalty.

The DHS videos, by contrast, are focused on action inside the US instead of protecting the country from foreign threats.

The videos also make questions about deploying the National Guard in US cities beside the point. There’s already a militarized force on the ground.

CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said there is nothing strange about law enforcement recording their activities. Some jurisdictions in fact require the use of body cams. But these videos are different, she said.

“They do not look like police videos,” said Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs during the Obama administration. “They look like campaign ones.”

Rather than serve a policing purpose, Kayyem said, the videos seem more designed to “scare communities, pretend like they are fighting a dangerous threat, or, as I suspect, to be used in GOP campaigns.”

When the government trolls

DHS doesn’t just post action movie-style content. It also trolls critics who don’t like the image of masked agents arresting people without warrants in American streets.

When the country singer Zach Bryan published a snippet of a song that seemed to criticize ICE for kicking down people’s doors with the tag line, “the fading of the Red White and Blue,” DHS clapped back at the US Navy veteran by using another one of his songs, “All Night Revival,” as the soundtrack for a montage of its raids.

Bryan has since clarified that he falls on neither of the “radical sides” of the political aisle.

“Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are,” he said in an Instagram story. “We need to find our way back.”

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos”

The DHS social media effort is hip to the social media age, loaded up with guns, “Cops”-style arrests, fit-looking agents in combat gear, and knowing jokes.

One video took out of a context a comment by the comedian and manosphere podcaster Theo Von, who was recorded by a fan saying, “Heard you got deported dude, bye.”

That snippet was used by DHS as the punchline of another video. In his own social media post, Von asked the government to take it down.

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos,” Von said on X. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”

Surely the Von controversy only got more eyeballs on the video. A video featuring hard-hitting arrests over the Pokémon theme also got attention. The US government did not seek permission to use the theme, according to Pokémon.

Who is being arrested and deported?

The videos make use of the conservative media ecosystem by tapping influencers for ridealongs.

One recent video shared by the conservative content creator Benny Johnson showed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, apparently talking to a man she identified as a pedophile, driving home the government allegation that they are first targeting criminals for deportation.

But the man being arrested was not identified, making it impossible to verify the story.

When DHS posted a release identifying the “worst of the worst” of the undocumented immigrants arrested in Portland, alleging they were hardened criminals and pedophiles, some of the names did not have Oregon or federal cases associated with their names. Others had recently been in prison, serving sentences.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Their allegations about detainees must be verified, however — especially after allegations about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador for a time earlier this year, turned out to be overstated.

Abrego Garcia is back in the US and the government has charged him with human smuggling, a charge a federal judge said recently may have been brought out of vindictiveness.

Stars of the genre

Abrego Garcia was initially taken to a supermax prison in El Salvador, a place that seems designed to go viral for its harshness, as CNN’s David Culver documented.

The initial transfer of deportees to that prison was the subject of multiple US government videos.

Noem is a frequent star of government deportation videos, including a trip to the El Salvador prison, after which critics accused her of playing to cameras.

Another star of DHS videos is Gregory Bovino, the border patrol chief leading efforts on the ground in Chicago.

During an interview for a recent profile, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez asked him about the videos and social media strategy. Bovino argued they are “so real life they appear to be Hollywood.”

“You think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life”

The full exchange is interesting:

ALVAREZ: What is the message you want people to take from the videos and your general presence on, for example, X?

BOVINO: Transparency. Uh, I think the public sometimes doesn’t get transparency. We can go back to that reporter that misquoted me. That wasn’t transparent. That was agenda-driven. This is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public a snapshot, a real-time snapshot of what is really happening, whether it’s on the border, or now in Los Angeles and or Chicago, what’s really happening. So they can take a look at that social media, those social media pages, and they’re getting an accurate snapshot of what’s happening. Now you might say, “Hey, that’s Hollywood. That looks like Hollywood.” Well, you know …

ALVAREZ: It’s highly produced.

BOVINO: Well, you know, it’s actually produced — there are Border Patrol agents that produce that. Those are border patrol agents that have learned their craft. Border Patrol agents right off the line — and they learn their craft — that are producing those, but you think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life. It might be so real life that it appears to be Hollywood, but a lot of that is real time.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-03t160559z-680349489-rc2d4hatbfze-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago-20251009210438411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-10 12:00:35.017488

The oh-dark-thirty immigration enforcement raid in the early hours of 1 October featured an air assault from helicopters. Officers went door to door in the building, using charges to blow the hinges off doors and flashbang grenades to clear apartments. They hauled men, women and children from the building in zip ties and often little else, ostensibly to capture undocumented gang members.

The troubled apartment building at 7500 S South Shore Drive hadn’t passed an annual inspection since 2022. With the remains of doors and furniture and the bloodied, scattered belongings of former tenants in tatters, it may struggle to pass another.

“So many of these people remain without shelter or a place to live because it essentially rendered their homes and that entire apartment complex uninhabitable,” said Colleen Connell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. She described the apartment raid as a military-style attack. Days afterward, the building looked like a war zone, which may be the point.

Addressing an assembly of high-ranking military officers last week, Donald Trump in impromptu comments called for the military to use American cities as “training grounds for our military”. The comment was a continuation of his belligerence toward cities full of Democratic voters and nonwhite populations, delivered a couple of weeks after he meme-posted an image cribbed from the war movie Apocalypse Now about going to “war” in Chicago.

For those on the receiving end of federal force from masked agents in military fatigues, a flashbang grenade thrown by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent or a soldier may be a distinction without a difference.

Mónica Solórzano was standing next to the mayor of Carpinteria, a farm town in southern California, watching Ice raid a marijuana farm when a flashbang grenade went off at her feet.

“The canister flashed and made a loud explosive sound, like a firecracker. The noise hurt my ears,” she wrote in a deposition for a suit filed by the Los Angeles Press Club in July, seeking an injunction against attacks on the press, protesters and observers there during the administration’s immigration enforcement surge. “When the flashbang detonated, the people around me started screaming and running. I fell to the ground and thought I was going to be trampled.”

Solórzano, a Carpinteria city council member, was one of dozens of witnesses who described homeland security officers wearing military-style fatigues, using armored personnel carriers and military equipment as they rolled through communities as part of Ice’s surge.

Flashbang grenades are standard tools for clearing a room when soldiers conduct military operations on urban terrain. But the use of them by civilian police officers has been sharply curtailed, with many jurisdictions banning them entirely.

“The use of flash-bang or stun grenades for crowd control is an example of the inappropriate, inadequately regulated use of military weapons for crowd management,” wrote California physician Rohini J Haar, offering expert testimony for the LA Press Club suit. “While the stated objective of stun grenades is to cause disorientation and a temporary sense of panic, the potential for severe blast injuries and even death caused by the pressure of the blast or by shrapnel from the fragmentation of plastic and metal constituents of the grenade is disproportionately high. The blinding light and deafening sound they produce can also cause injuries indiscriminately.”

Haar is the author of Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons, a report cataloguing deaths from flashbang use.

Federal agents used flashbang grenades both to disperse crowds of protesters in California in July, and as room-clearing munitions on the raid on an apartment building in Chicago last week.

“Treating a US city like a war zone is intolerable,” wrote a group of eight Democratic lawmakers on the US House homeland security committee, asking the Department of Homeland Security to produce arrest or search warrants for the operation, arrest figures, confirmation of anyone they claim was a member of Tren de Aragua, and a justification for the “heavy-handed” tactics employed. “Please detail why helicopters were needed for this operation,” they asked. “Which agency provided the helicopters and agents manning them?”

DHS has not responded to their questions, nor to those of the Guardian.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and former Seattle police chief, reviewed the testimony offered in support of the LA Press Club suit, concluding that DHS had regularly engaged in excessive use of force.

“Some of the agencies involved have no responsibility for urban crowd control, such as Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is an investigative agency within DHS, that typically does fraud investigations and human trafficking investigations,” Kerlikowske wrote in an affidavit. “Similarly, the Special Response Team (SRT) is a tactical unit with DHS that is part of CBP Office of Field Operations that executes dangerous warrants. It also provided security for me, when I was head of CBP. These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so.”

A preliminary injunction was granted last month barring LA police from arresting journalists and limiting their use of force.

Even without reference to the use of national guard troops and equipment in support of enforcing the law – a proposition by Trump that federal courts have rejected multiple times this year – the use of military equipment and military tactics like armored vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, Predator drones and military weapons by civilian law enforcement in the administration has drawn notice and condemnation.

The police agencies of large cities have experience with street protests, and the crowd-control tactics permitted to those agencies are often the result of arduous, deeply argued policy debates by locally elected leaders.

That’s not what Chicago is seeing on the ground.

“What we have seen in particular is the shooting of projectiles, so-called nonlethal rounds, at protesters and at members of the press,” said Connell of the ACLU. “Rather than shooting at the ground, we’ve seen actual incidents of protesters and the press being hit by those projectiles. … We’ve seen an exacerbation of the sort of display of military-style equipment and tactics, whether it’s an armored vehicle with an armed, masked, camouflaged Ice agent or other federal law enforcement agent atop the turret, armed with heavy military-style equipment.”

Journalists from Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club and other press organizations filed suit Monday in federal court, seeking an injunction against the federal government for actions against journalists outside the Broadview Ice facility. Four of Block Club’s journalists were “indiscriminately shot with pepper-spray bullets and tear-gassed by federal agents” while covering the raid. The lawsuit is an attempt to bar federal agents from, among other things, indiscriminately using chemical weapons against journalists asserting their first amendment right to report.

While federal agencies could fly a helicopter in for a raid on an apartment building in Chicago, many civilians in the Windy City have been locked out of their drones for two weeks.

Citing “special security reasons”, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 12-day-long ban on drone flights by anyone without a special commercial operating exemption across a 15-nautical-mile radius around the Ice facility near Chicago. As a practical matter, it denies anyone except news stations with a helicopter from observing federal operations from the air. Practiced drone operators – and journalists – have little experience with this kind of airspace control.

“I’ve had a drone license basically with the FAA for almost as long as that program has existed – at least eight years – and I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the LA Press Club and deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “They’re trying to basically take their militarization techniques to the sky. They’re trying to keep the enemy out of the sky, the enemy being anyone who is observing them.”

Rose notes that the no-fly space above Los Angeles during the protests earlier this year was 900 times smaller than Chicago, but that DHS filled that airspace with Predator drones drawn from the border to surveil crowds.

“It doesn’t matter what uniform they wear, whether they are federal agents or troops, they are bound by the constitution,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “People need to know that if any member of the federal force violates their rights, they need to be held accountable”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0b612c25ad32d87969d7a66d8df2faac2b9bfc/621_0_6211_4971/master/6211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47ad2d558c9cb006e34498ec9ec699fd",N,,2025-10-10 11:59:47.648965

Why it matters: In recent days, Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago over the objections of local city officials — and he's steadily ramped up immigration raids around the country since taking office.

Zoom in: The Seattle Police Department ""will maintain functional independence"" should federal troops arrive in the city, and ""not act at the direction of the National Guard or federal authorities,"" according to the first executive order signed by Harrell Wednesday.

Seattle police will ""report daily"" to the mayor on the known actions of any deployed federal troops, the order adds.

It also creates a city task force aimed at preparing for troops to arrive, while directing Seattle officials to ready a lawsuit to challenge any such deployment.

What they're saying: ""As we've seen in Portland and now Chicago, President Trump is unilaterally ramping up his military occupation of American cities,"" Harrell said during a press conference.

""He is showing no respect for the rule of law,"" Harrell said. ""We are ready to fight in court.""

The order also addresses possible protests against federal troops, saying the city ""shall offer to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful"" and ""minimize the potential for conflict.""

In the other executive order, Harrell pledges to submit an ordinance to the City Council banning federal civil immigration enforcement activities on city property.

The mayor will also propose an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by federal law enforcement agents, the order says, citing recent ""warrantless arrests and detentions by masked and un-uniformed individuals"" under the Trump administration.

Between the lines: ""We'll continue to build trust and transparency to ensure that our immigrant and refugee communities continue to see Seattle as a true welcoming city,"" Hamdi Mohamed, director of Seattle's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, told reporters.

That will involve regularly requesting information about federal immigration enforcement actions in Seattle, to help ""identify any patterns of bias and overreach,"" per Harrell's order.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.
In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.
G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

Overcrowding and migration links

Belgium’s prison network now holds 13,689 detainees for roughly 11,040 places, the Central Monitoring Council for Prisons reported in April 2025. Amnesty International has described the situation as ""structural overcrowding,"" citing people sleeping on mattresses on the floor and limited access to rehabilitation services.

In an analysis published on 1 April 2025, Belgian newspaper Le Soir reported that foreign nationals account for about 43 percent of Belgium’s prison population, though only around 31 percent lack residence rights.

The paper noted that many inmates had valid permits before detention and lost them while serving their sentences, complicating assumptions about who could legally be transferred abroad.

Van Bossuyt argues that convicted offenders without the right to remain in Belgium should serve their sentences outside the country.

""Anyone staying illegally in our country and choosing to commit crimes must leave -- either to their country of origin or to a prison outside Belgium,"" she told Belgian media.

The government argues that transferring even part of this group could ease pressure on domestic facilities while reinforcing its policy of linking migration control with enforcement of criminal judgments.

Balkan option under study

Under the Belgian government's current coalition agreement, any new facility must be located outside the European Union but in a European constitutional state where the rule of law and human-rights standards are respected. An internal feasibility study by the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons concluded that Kosovo and Albania meet those criteria.

The idea draws on the Denmark-Kosovo agreement, under which Copenhagen is renting 300 cells in Gjilan prison for foreign inmates at a cost of about 210 million euros over 10 years. Implementation has been delayed until at least 2027 as Kosovo upgrades the facility to Danish standards.

Belgium also rented space in the Tilburg prison in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2016 to cope with similar shortages, but that arrangement ended amid financial and logistical difficulties.

Legal and human-rights issues

Any foreign-detention plan would have to comply with Belgium’s obligations under the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the EU Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA, both of which require agreement of the states involved and usually of the prisoner.

Existing bilateral treaties with Albania and Kosovo allow only case-by-case transfers. Establishing a prison abroad would therefore require new bilateral agreements and parliamentary approval.

Legal experts and rights advocates warn that moving prisoners outside Belgium could blur accountability. As the sentencing state and a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, Belgium would remain responsible for ensuring detention conditions meet international standards and that inmates have effective access to Belgian courts if their rights are violated.

Both Amnesty International and the Central Monitoring Council have urged the government to strengthen domestic capacity and maintain clear oversight mechanisms if any foreign facility is pursued.

A Justice Ministry briefing reported in Belgian media found that only about 255 cases were legally transferable under existing treaties -- less than 2 percent of the total prison population -- highlighting the limited short-term impact of such schemes.

Afghan returns and migration diplomacy

The prison initiative coincides with a broader tightening of Belgium’s migration policy, particularly concerning returns of irregular migrants and foreign offenders.

On October 3, 2025, Van Bossuyt announced that she would seek European Union support to explore ""technical cooperation"" with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to confirm the identities of Afghans that Belgium intends to deport.

""At a diplomatic level, we need to look at how to deal pragmatically with the Afghan regime,"" she said in a statement released by her office.

Van Bossuyt said she had discussed the issue with EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner during talks on the implementation of the European Migration Pact, and planned to raise it again at an informal ministerial meeting in Munich on October 4 with counterparts from Germany, France, Denmark, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic.

According to the Flemish news agency VRT, Afghans remain among the largest groups applying for asylum in Belgium, yet less than half of the applications are approved. Returns and voluntary repatriations have been impossible since 2021 because Belgium has no diplomatic ties with the Taliban.

""This problem is not unique to Belgium,"" the minister’s office stated. ""Solutions for the voluntary and forced return of Afghans must be sought at a European level. For those that have no future in the European Union, the message must be clear: return is the only option.""

Van Bossuyt said she hopes to build a coalition of EU countries to address the European-wide impasse on Afghan deportations.

European and regional context

Several European governments are experimenting with ways to manage migration and detention externally.

In the United Kingdom, Politico reported that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is considering a ""migrant-return hub"" in the Western Balkans, with Kosovo viewed as a possible location for processing failed asylum seekers.

Both the Belgian and British discussions illustrate a shift toward regional partnerships for returns and detention, even as analysts warn that political fragility and foreign influence in the Balkans could complicate implementation.

Next steps

Belgium’s talks with Albania and Kosovo are exploratory; no binding agreements have been signed. A senior Justice Ministry official told The Brussels Times that even under favorable conditions, ""it would take at least three to five years before becoming operational.""

Since June, Mr. Trump has sent soldiers — often over the objections of state and local leaders — to cities including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, Memphis and Portland, Ore.

The mobilizations represent a departure from the traditional role of the Guard, a state-based military force whose domestic deployments have historically involved humanitarian assistance. And they have prompted lawsuits across the country, several of them accusing the Trump administration of exceeding its legal authority.

Here’s how courts have landed on those cases so far.

Los Angeles

In June, the Trump administration sent nearly 5,000 troops, from both the National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps, to the Los Angeles area, citing a need to quell protests over immigration raids. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California filed suit on June 9, accusing Mr. Trump of an “unprecedented usurpation of state authority and resources.”

On Sept. 2, Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the National Guard troops were being used illegally. He wrote that the Trump administration had violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that makes it illegal to use federal troops for domestic policing in most circumstances.

The ruling barred the federal government from using troops anywhere in California to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

Mr. Trump has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which agreed to pause the district court’s ruling for now, pending a hearing. In the meantime, the Pentagon has withdrawn most of the troops who were sent to Southern California, and Mr. Newsom has asked the court to send them all home.

Portland, Ore.

State and local leaders in Oregon filed suit against the Trump administration on Sept. 28, after it called 200 Oregon National Guard members into Portland. Mr. Trump called the city “war-ravaged” and cited protests against federal immigration raids.

On Oct. 4, a federal judge blocked the mobilization with a temporary restraining order. The judge, Karin Immergut of the U.S. District Court in Oregon, said the president had most likely exceeded his legal authority in calling up the troops. Judge Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the protests “were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the president’s directive.”

Mr. Trump then tried to deploy out-of-state National Guard troops to Portland. In response, Judge Immergut broadened her order to cover “the relocation, federalization or deployment of members of the National Guard of any state or the District of Columbia in the state of Oregon.”

The federal government appealed Judge Immergut’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the protests in Portland amounted to a “rebellion” and that courts do not have the power to review the president’s decisions about when to deploy the National Guard.

Three judges from the Ninth Circuit ruled on Wednesday that Oregon National Guard members could stay under federal control until a broader legal ruling was issued, though they left in place a temporary order from Judge Immergut that barred the troops from being deployed. At a hearing on Thursday, the panel appeared to take seriously arguments by the administration’s lawyers that deployment would be legal, and they questioned Judge Immergut’s conclusion that a military presence was not needed.

It is not clear when the court will issue a ruling in the case.

About 200 National Guard troops were brought in from Texas. Earlier in the week, a federal judge declined to immediately block the deployment, setting a hearing in the case for Thursday.

After that hearing, the judge, April M. Perry, temporarily blocked National Guard operations in the area for 14 days. She said that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois” and that the deployment of troops would “only add fuel to the fire.”

Judge Perry said a full written opinion was likely to be issued on Friday. The Trump administration is likely to appeal.

Washington

The case in Washington, filed earlier this year by Brian Schwalb, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, is a bit different from others.

The District of Columbia does not have a governor — the official who typically approves the use of federal military forces before they can be sent to a state — and the case and arguments over the deployment of National Guard troops there have largely hinged on the Home Rule Act. That law, from 1973, gives the federal government control of the District of Columbia National Guard, while the district is granted local governance rights, such as giving residents the power to elect their own mayor and a local council.

On Aug. 11, Mr. Trump, citing the Home Rule Act, took control of the District of Columbia police for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to address what he called a “crime-infested wasteland” in the nation’s capital.

Mr. Schwalb sued the administration over the takeover, saying its actions had exceeded the law and would “sow chaos” in the police force. The case settled after lengthy negotiations in which the U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, agreed to allow the city’s police chief to maintain control of her department’s day-to-day operations while taking orders from the mayor. Ms. Bondi directed the mayor to order the Police Department to help with immigration enforcement.

On Sept. 4, Mr. Schwalb filed suit again, this time over the deployment of the troops, whose numbers peaked at about 2,400. He argued that the deployment without the mayor’s consent had violated the U.S. Constitution and Washington’s autonomy under the Home Rule Act.

Mr. Schwalb asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the deployment. A preliminary hearing for the case is scheduled for Oct. 24.

Memphis

Mr. Trump announced on Sept. 12 that he would send National Guard troops to Memphis, citing concerns about safety in the city. The State of Tennessee, which has a Republican governor, has not filed any legal challenges seeking to block the troops. The soldiers are expected to be deployed in Memphis on Friday.

This client alert recaps the first birthright citizenship SCOTUS decision, intervening court cases, policy memo, and what a decision to accept the case could mean for the Fourteenth Amendment. Building on our client alert, ""Supreme Court Decision Continues Legal Battle Over Birthright Citizenship,"" we also explore how an implementation memo would operate in practice and what clients should anticipate while the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the case.

Recap of Supreme Court Ruling

In its June 27 decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court did not address the merits of the birthright citizenship EO ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship"". Instead, the Court narrowed the scope of the lower courts' nationwide injunctions that blocked its implementation, limiting them to the parties involved. SCOTUS directed the lower courts to revise their orders ""expeditiously,"" and pushed the EO's effective date back to July 28, 2025. While that date has now passed, subsequent lower court rulings have kept the EO on hold, as discussed below.

Subsequent Court Rulings & The Rise of Class Actions

In July 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a nationwide preliminary injunction, agreeing that broad relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. This appeal arose from a February 2025 decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, which had blocked the EO in a suit brought by a coalition of states: Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit sent a signal of its view on the merits, concluding there is a ""strong likelihood"" that the EO is invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Similarly, on October 3, 2025, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the nationwide injunction. The latest appeals court decision marks the fifth federal court since June to either issue or uphold orders blocking the EO.

Throughout the various cases this summer, the Trump Administration indicated that it planned to ask the Supreme Court to take up the question of the constitutionality of birthright citizenship imminently. On Friday, September 26, the Administration did so. Specifically, the Administration cited the ruling by the 9th Circuit, as well as the district court decision in New Hampshire.

The July 25 USCIS Memo

On July 25, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released a memorandum outlining how the Trump Administration intends to implement its birthright citizenship policy in the event that it prevails in the courts. The memorandum provides new definitions of ""unlawfully present"" and ""lawful but temporary"" presence and specifies which categories of children would no longer be recognized as U.S. citizens at birth: changes that, if implemented, would have sweeping consequences for mixed‑status families, temporary visa holders, and other noncitizen populations.

The USCIS memo does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of certain children whose mother is ""unlawfully present"" or whose mother was present in a ""lawful but temporary"" status if the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. The ""lawful but temporary"" category broadly encompasses most nonimmigrant visa holders, TPS beneficiaries, and Visa Waiver Program entrants, among others.

Potential Impacts of Birthright Citizenship Restriction Policy

The USCIS implementation memo could affect a broad range of temporary visa holders, humanitarian beneficiaries, and mixed-status families. These include, but are not limited to:

A child born to a mother whose nonimmigrant status, such as an H-4, is pending might also have ""pending"" citizenship status.

A child born to an F-1 parent who violated their duration of status (D/S) by unauthorized employment might also be deemed in violation of immigration status and potentially subject to removal.

A child born to parents who applied to adjust status based on an employment-based sponsorship, who are waiting for a green card number to be available from their country, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a mother with DACA who has spent years in the United States and to a father on an H-1B visa leading a team at a tech company in Texas, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Ukrainian mother living in the United States who fled Russia's invasion and was granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) as the father remains fighting for the Ukrainian army, would not have certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Haitian mother who recently fled political violence and instability, paroled into the country only months ago, while her partner claims asylum, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S. citizen.

Concerns About Inconsistent Application

If the Supreme Court were to further restrict national injunctions and allow the implementation of this policy, it could take effect in some states but be blocked in others. As a result, if a mother traveling for work from Arizona to Nevada goes into labor unexpectedly, then her baby, delivered in a Nevada hospital, would not be recognized as a U.S. citizen, while a baby born a few days earlier at her home hospital in Phoenix would be recognized as a U.S. citizen. A family living near the New Jersey–Pennsylvania border could have two very different outcomes depending on which side of the state line their child is born on while visiting relatives.

Concerns About Stateless Children

This policy implementation could also result in some children being born stateless. Some countries do not automatically grant citizenship to children born abroad, or impose complex requirements that parents may be unable to meet. A stateless individual without a recognized citizenship may be denied a passport or public benefits and could lack certainty about where they could lawfully reside.

Concerns About Uncertain Enforcement

The USCIS memo also creates uncertainty about what would happen to children born without citizenship under this policy. It states that, ""to fill any regulatory gaps,"" the Department would propose to defer immigration enforcement against these children until new rules are in place. That language is unclear about whether it intends to only offer temporary protection from deportation or whether the government would ultimately seek to remove those children once that deferral ends.

Next Steps at SCOTUS

The Trump Administration chose not to fast-track its request, but instead allowed the case to move through the Court's normal schedule. If at least four justices vote to hear the case, oral arguments could occur sometime in 2026, with a decision by the end of the Court's term next summer.

We recommend that employers assess whether they have workers who may be affected, that families with pending or potential immigration applications seek legal guidance on available paths to permanent status, and that all stakeholders stay informed as litigation and additional agency actions unfold. Our team at Klasko will continue to track these issues closely and is available to advise on proactive steps to mitigate risk and plan for multiple outcomes.

The order follows a motion filed by the Village of Broadview, which argued that ICE’s installation of the fence on a public street violated local ordinances and created safety hazards.

The fence, built on Sept. 23, was intended to protect the ICE facility during protests that have at times turned tense, with occasional clashes between demonstrators and federal agents.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson called the ruling ""a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.""

""The judge’s decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview’s ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders,"" Thompson said in a statement.

The overture was rebuffed by the head of the County Board, which also oversees the jail as the Board of Corrections. Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of ICE tactics, responded in a brief statement that the board had not been involved in related conversations with Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

Garcia said he does not anticipate the board entertaining an ICE contract “any time in the foreseeable future.”

The authority to bring forth an agenda item to the Board of Commissioners or Corrections of the state’s most populated county lies with the board chair (Garcia) or a four-commissioner majority.

Money source

Hanson, in his statement, said he has urged the County Board to reconsider entering into a detention agreement with ICE. Attached was an Oct. 7 memorandum addressed to Garcia and Vice Chair Mike Friend, which noted in part that nearly 80 workers detained in a June 10 Omaha immigration raid were transported to the Lincoln County jail in North Platte, which is more than four hours away.

Hanson said that, for those individuals, a Douglas County-ICE detention contract could have meant staying nearer to loved ones, with “real, in-person access to legal representation” and access to Omaha’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.”

Furthermore, Hanson said, an ICE detention contract would result in “millions of dollars of much-needed revenue.” He said his department’s proposed budget was trimmed by nearly a half-million dollars and said the safety of county residents will suffer.

Hanson’s proposal comes as the State of Nebraska is transforming a McCook-based state prison facility into a nearly 300-bed Midwest hub for ICE detainees. That proposal, backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and several state legislators, has sparked controversy and opposition from various organizations and some lawmakers.

“Ultimately we cannot control what the federal government does,” Hanson wrote to county commissioners. “What we can control is retaining our neighbors and shared constituents within our community as they navigate their due process.”

He contends the county jail is operating at “historic low capacity” and that space exists to “keep our neighbors in our community.”

LULAC’s role

Hanson’s statement also announced that his office and the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) Nebraska, had started discussions on “humane and accountable detention practices.”

The sheriff said that while his office and LULAC Nebraska hold different perspectives on whether the county should enter into a detention agreement with ICE, their dialogue “reflects a commitment to transparency and community input.”

Elsa Aranda, LULAC Nebraska state director, said she has offered to help develop independent oversight structures and detainee support frameworks to ensure fairness.

However, national LULAC spokesman David Cruz told the Nebraska Examiner that the sheriff’s statement was “premature” and that “any inference that LULAC is either supporting or endorsing or approving such a project would be inaccurate.”

He said the civil rights organization’s national leadership did not approve “a public statement using the name of LULAC in such a context.” LULAC describes itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic and Latin-American civil rights organization in the U.S.

Three months after Omaha raid: One ICE detention chapter winds down, another heats up

Cruz said LULAC’s national president Ramon Palomares and advisor Hector Flores did speak with Hanson and his chief deputy at a conference they all attended in Dallas — as the sheriff wrote in his memo to the County Board.

But he said that the LULAC representatives did not know beforehand the topic to be discussed. “They went and listened,” he said, and said they’d take it back to the organization’s attorneys.

Aranda, in remarks included in the sheriff’s statement, said her role as Nebraska state director was “to ensure that if detention occurs, it happens under humane, fair and transparent conditions – and that the rights and dignity of every person are protected, just as the sheriff is proposing.”

Cruz, however, said the national network’s stance is “staunch” opposition to detention centers for “detainees who are being held on immigration-related issues.” He added, “Any use of the name LULAC or the appearance lending weight to this decision would be inaccurate.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MaskICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:00:08.195249

Barrot said that the details would be shared with the United States “so that they can integrate them” into future plans. John Irish reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drone and missile strikes overnight have wounded at least 20 people in Kyiv and caused blackouts across Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities said today. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko called the attack “one of the largest concentrated strikes” against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian attack drones, missiles and guided bombs over the Zaporizhzhia region killed a 7 year old and wounded his parents, military officials said. AP News reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, yesterday indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan. James’ first court appearance is scheduled for October 24. “These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,” James said yesterday. Kristen Holmes, Hannah Rabinowitz, and Kara Scannell report for CNN.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week fired Navy chief of staff Jon Harrison, without providing a public explanation. Five former and current officials said that there is a deepening sense of uncertainty in the department and concerns about Hegseth’s objectives. One official spoke about a “culture of fear; there’s a culture of intimidation and retaliation.” Another said, “It’s better just to keep your head down.” Paul McLeary and Daniel Lippman report for POLITICO.

The Internal Revenue Service yesterday pivoted on its position that furloughed workers would be “compensated on the earliest date possible” after the Government shutdown ends, according to an email obtained by POLITICO. The email sent to employees yesterday states that IRS’s initial memo on furlough guidance “incorrectly stated the nature of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019” and that further guidance will be provided on the issue. Danny Nguyen reports for Axios.

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children is running out of money, despite a White House pledge earlier this week to use tariff revenue to support the program during the government shutdown. “We have gotten no information about how much money would be available, when it would be available to states or what states would be able to use it for,” National WIC Association policy director Ali Hard said. Several sources said that lawmakers and their staff had not been informed of the administration’s plans. Marcia Brown reports for POLITICO.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) yesterday criticized the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Illinois, adding that he “believe[s] in the federalist system – that’s states’ rights.” “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration,” Stitt told the New York Times. Stitt expressed support for Trump’s effort to protect ICE agents but raised concerns about the precedent that was being set by guard deployment. J. David Goodman reports.

Tennessee National Guard troops will begin patrolling Memphis today, providing additional “eyes and ears” to Memphis police officers, the city announced in an online update. It is unclear how many troops will be deployed. Emily Cochrane reports for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Officials in Los Angeles County are considering declaring a state of emergency to provide relief for immigrants who have suffered financially from fear of ICE raids. The county board voted 4 to 1 on Tuesday to put an emergency declaration up for a vote on October 14. “Families are now afraid to go to work, to attend school or even to buy groceries,” a county supervisor said on Tuesday. A declaration would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to put in place an eviction moratorium and other protections. Orlando Mayorquín reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Appeals court judges yesterday appeared sceptical of Oregon’s case that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland during oral arguments. “What I’m struggling with is, the president gets to direct his resources as he seems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say ‘No, you need to do it differently,’” Judge Ryan Nelson said. It is unclear when the court will issue a ruling. Kale Williams reports for Axios.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked Trump from federalizing or deploying the National Guard from Illinois or any other state for use in Illinois for two weeks. The judge said that “there is overwhelming evidence submitted that the provocative nature of ICE’s enforcement activity, the repeated constitutional violations, has itself caused a significant increase in protest activity.” The judge added that her full written order will be made available today.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations.

The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE, a 10-fold increase in its current budget, as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as a result of the Republican dominated Congress and its failure to pass a spending measure by October 1, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, one of Trump’s top priorities, is still flush with cash.

MILLIONS SPENT ON THE 30-SECOND ADS

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington DC. Adding to the list: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of October 6, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in October, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a September 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

LOCAL POLICE CAN’T COMPETE WITH ICE PROMISES

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Captain John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

LAKE NORDEN — The names on the list included some of Dorothy Elliott’s best employees: hardworking, reliable, honest.

Most had been working at Drumgoon Dairy for years. Some worked there for nearly two decades, playing a role in the operation’s expansion and success.

But after an audit of the dairy at the end of May by the federal Department of Homeland Security, 38 of those employees are gone.

The department said they each had inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.

Elliott co-owns the farm near Lake Norden, 5 miles from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s eastern South Dakota home. Elliott asked the affected employees for updated documentation but ultimately had to fire those who weren’t able to adequately resolve the problems with their documents. One person returned home because his visa was expiring, and another quit.

The audit decimated Elliott’s workforce, once more than 50 employees, dropping it to just 16.

Audits at dairy farms under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement efforts have “created unrest” among workers and owners, Elliott said. It’s made for a tough summer in an industry that was flourishing after decades of support from state government.

Elliott’s remaining employees have been working without breaks, she said. Without a pathway or plan to create a sustainable workforce in agriculture and by “removing everyone working in it,” she worries some agricultural operations will go out of business. She hopes Drumgoon isn’t one of them.

“Basically, we’ve turned off the tap, but we’ve done nothing to create a solution as to how we find employees for the dairy industry,” she said.

Never previously audited

Elliott is required to file I-9 forms with documentation proving her workers’ identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. It puts employers in a difficult position, said Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, because applicants may present fraudulent documents an employer doesn’t catch. Yet employers could also be sued for mistakenly rejecting valid documents.

“If employers are presented with documentation that looks real and legitimate, they’re obligated to accept it,” VanderWal said. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offers similar guidance, saying employers must accept documentation if it “reasonably appears to be genuine.”

Elliott could use the federal government’s web-based system, E-Verify, that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the country. But E-Verify is not mandated for new hires in South Dakota, and Elliott said she doesn’t use it because of “unreliable results.” Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed the use of E-Verify, citing reasons including errors that cost people jobs because the system wrongly flagged them.

So Elliott evaluates applicants’ documents herself. If their IDs are out of date or if they have a visa and are applying from another farm without returning home, she passes on hiring them. She’s turned people away a dozen times over the years, she said.

Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

Drumgoon was never audited before. In her past dealings with the Department of Homeland Security during nearly two decades of running the dairy, Elliott said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would merely tell her they were searching for a person and ask for a notification if the person applied for a job.

This time was different. After an audit, employers are required to terminate unauthorized workers who can’t prove their employability, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Audits — which are distinct from raids or other immigration enforcement operations — are meant to ensure businesses comply with federal employment laws.

Elliott does not know where her 38 former employees went. They could be working at other dairies in the U.S. They could have left the country. They could be anywhere.

Because the dairy is near a farm owned by Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, and because Noem was in the state during the month of the audit to receive an honorary degree, South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Homeland Security if Noem had a direct role in the audit. The department didn’t respond to the question.

Elliott declined to talk about Noem, saying she recognizes that federal immigration authorities “have a job to do.”

South Dakota Farmers Union President Doug Sombke called federal dairy audits “stupid,” because they needlessly displace workers.

“Why the heck can’t we continue to use them there as an intern or apprentice or whatever you want to call it and make it legal? Why is it so important we grab them and call them a criminal? No one wants those jobs,” Sombke said. “I don’t understand why you’d cripple or cause problems for a labor shortage when all you have to do is get them legalized.”

Immigrants hiring immigrants

Elliott’s connection to immigrants isn’t limited to her employees. She was born in the United States but married her husband, Rodney, in Northern Ireland, where they had their children.

Eliott worked in health care and her husband operated their 140-cow dairy farm in Northern Ireland when a newspaper ad, “Wanted: Dairy farmers in South Dakota,” caught their attention. Moving to America meant fewer regulations, cheaper land, cheaper feed and the ability to grow their business, she said.

The couple used the EB-5 investment-for-visa program to secure backers for their operation, opened the dairy in 2006, paid off the investors within a few years and have been expanding ever since. They started with about 1,500 cows in 2006 and have grown to 6,500.

Elliott’s children got their citizenship shortly after moving to the U.S., and her husband became a citizen about eight years after they moved. That experience helps her empathize with her workers, many of whom are Hispanic. She said everything they’re doing is to support their families back home, even though many aren’t able to see their families for years at a time.

“All they’re guilty of is working and doing a job that isn’t currently being filled by an American,” Elliott said.

Taneeza Islam advocates for immigrants as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace. She’s spoken to immigrant workers in other industries who were scared and confused after being terminated due to stricter immigration enforcement.

“We have two very separate worlds right now: the community that’s impacted and worried about getting detained and deported, and the community that doesn’t know this is happening here,” Islam said.

State recruited dairies

The Elliotts are among many new South Dakotans who’ve helped the dairy industry boom in the last two decades. Then-governor and now-U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, focused on supporting the industry in the early 2000s, which included efforts to recruit farmers from overseas.

In 2010, South Dakota’s dairy industry had an economic impact of $1.27 billion. By 2023, that had grown to $5.67 billion.

“We’ve achieved our goals we set out for ourselves: build a dairy, milk cows and grow the dairy industry in South Dakota,” Elliott said. “Is it a sustainable goal if there’s nobody to work on these dairies? No. So all the time, money, effort, investment and hard work that has gone into it will be null and void if there isn’t a workforce.”

Sombke, the state Farmers Union president, said the state’s investment in dairy “has been a good thing,” but he isn’t surprised by the recent disruption in the industry.

South Dakota Searchlight requested the number of audits conducted in South Dakota so far in 2025, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the department “does not disclose specific data on audits or enforcement actions by state or industry.”

Sombke said dairy audits are “way up” in the state compared to last year. He said nobody should be surprised to find workers at dairies without permission to be in the country.

“What do you expect? The unemployment rate is less than 2% in the state,” Sombke said. “You’re going to be looking for labor anywhere you can find it.”

Aftermath of an audit

Drumgoon Dairy’s remaining employees have made mistakes because of the long hours they’ve had to cover — like reversing a payloader into a manure pond — or because they’re new to working on the farm.

“Some of them only get one or two days off in a 15-day period,” Elliott said. “But what else do you do? Do you just let cows starve or calves die because there’s no one there to take care of them?”

Some nearby farms sent workers to help at Drumgoon for a couple of days at a time this summer after the audit. Elliott and her husband have spent over $110,000 on recruiters and transportation so far to hire 22 visa workers from Mexico. But the visas come with restrictions on the types of jobs workers can do, so Elliott hired a dozen or so new employees locally, and still wants to hire another 10 to 15 people to replace terminated staff.

Elliott is struggling to find local applicants, which she is required by law to attempt before hiring visa workers.

“If raising wages even more will bring Americans to work on the farm, we can try it,” Elliott said, “but there is a limit to how high you can raise wages when you don’t get to set the price of milk. Can I afford to pay a milker $25 an hour? At some point, you’d produce milk for more than you’re receiving for it.”

Trump could lead immigration reforms, Thune says

After a panel discussion at the annual Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell in August, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that he believes President Donald Trump is interested in legal immigration and work visa reforms.

“If we can find some willing partners in the Democrats, some sort of an immigration policy or a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility,” Thune said. “Ultimately, that’s the best long-term solution, and I’ve heard him talk about it.”

Sen. Rounds told Searchlight that as more people are deported and industries are disrupted, “we will get enough support from the administration to begin looking at a legal system again.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is running for South Dakota governor next year, said some visa programs should be modified to meet the needs of the dairy industry. Some visas are seasonal programs that require participants to return home after a few months. The programs don’t fit the needs of dairy operations that require workers year-round.

Elliott has broached the issue for years to Thune, Johnson, Rounds and other federal officials.

“All I hear is, ‘I’ll mention that. We’ll talk about that.’ But nothing,” Elliott said. “What we hear is there is absolutely no passion for any kind of change to the status quo.”

Farmers suggest solutions

Lynn Boadwine of Boadwine Farms in Baltic has “run out of gas” trying to advocate for visa and immigration policy changes to support the dairy industry. But he was heartened to hear the congressional delegates’ comments.

“There’s rhetoric, but are you really working on it?” Boadwine said. “I hope they are, because the clock is really ticking on all of these issues and we’re going to start to run out of people.”

Boadwine shared immigration reform ideas with congressional offices but hasn’t heard back on the topic. His hope is to modernize and simplify the H-2A visa program for dairies. His proposal would remove the seasonality requirement and allow workers in the country without legal permission to transition to guest-worker status. Long-term guest workers would have a path toward permanent residency by proving they are law-abiding, hardworking employees.

VanderWal, with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, said he met this spring with Noem in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He urged Noem and the Trump administration to back off on audits in the agricultural industry in hopes that Congress would “fix the system.”

“We wanted to impress upon the administration that if they started removing illegal workers up and down the food chain, from production to processing to transportation to grocery stores to restaurants, we’d see a disaster worse than the pandemic,” VanderWal said.

The administration has since “backed off ag,” VanderWal said, but the consequences linger for producers like the Elliotts and their employees. He said that unless President Trump “gets real forceful and goes after it,” he doesn’t expect Congress to undertake legal immigration reforms.

Economic consequence predicted

At Drumgoon Dairy, Elliott has tried automating aspects of her operation. She and her husband put in 20 robots a few years ago with the expectation they could hire students from nearby Lake Area Technical College’s robotics program to maintain them.

They posted robotics maintenance positions to attract graduates, but the response was deflating.

“To date, no one,” Elliott said.

She plans to remove the robots because the cost of running and servicing them is too expensive. So far, they’ve sold three. If the cost of technology continues to be prohibitive or there aren’t reforms to workforce visa or immigration programs, she said, “I wonder how we will become a sustainable industry.”

Elliott fears there will be consequences and higher prices for milk and other consumer dairy products without action at the federal level. Boadwine agreed.

“If we keep down this road we’ll have no choice but to import more food,” Boadwine said, “and the reason we’d import more is because it’s gotten so much more expensive here because we crippled ourselves.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/591A1151-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:59:51.459740

Nawrocki, a conservative who became president in August, had already declared during his election campaign that he would seek to unilaterally withdraw from the EU’s flagship migration deal, the Migration, and Asylum Pact. He lacks, however, the constitutional authority to do so as president.

“I will not consent to the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum in Poland,” he wrote in the letter.

While agreeing that irregular migration is a European problem, Nawrocki said the answer is not to send migrants to Central and Eastern Europe. Instead, he called for action at the source, including cracking down on smugglers

Earlier this year, pro-EU Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said that Warsaw would not implement any migration pact, nor any provisions of such projects that would force Poland to accept migrants identified in other European countries.

Still, Nawrocki said he was ready to work with other EU countries on border security, joint operations, sharing information, and giving technical help to countries facing strong migration pressure.

He added that Poland already carries a heavy load by defending the EU’s eastern flank, and sheltering nearly one million refugees from Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion.

In 2025, Poland spends as much as 4.48% of GDP for defence, according to NATO data – the largest percentage in the Alliance. Three years after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, 993,000 Ukrainians were under temporary protection in Poland, according to the office for foreigners.

Nawrocki also cited “the reluctance of the vast majority of Poles, regardless of political views”, to accept the forced relocation of migrants to Poland without providing data.

As many as 75% of Poles oppose Poland accepting migrants under the so-called solidarity mechanism, according to an Opinia24 survey for RMF FM. One in five respondents supported taking in migrants.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of immigrants in Colorado, including Caroline Dias Goncalves.

On June 5, Dias Goncalves, a Brazilian national and University of Utah student, was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy on Interstate 70 for following a truck too closely.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office said Dias-Goncalves had an expired visa but no criminal history, and the deputy used a Signal group chat with other law enforcement agencies to alert ICE agents of Dias Goncalves’ location.

The deputy let Dias Goncalves go, but ICE detained her shortly afterwards. She then spent two weeks at the ICE facility in Aurora, run by The GEO Group.

Weiser filed a civil lawsuit against the Mesa County deputy for violating Colorado laws that prohibit state and local officials from assisting federal immigration enforcement.

The ACLU said Dias Goncalves' case is yet another in which ICE agents made no effort to evaluate whether she was a flight risk. If they had, they would have learned she was a scholarship student in college with a stable home and family life, according to the lawsuit.

Denver7 anchor Shannon Ogden spoke with Hans Meyer, a co-counsel in the case, about the ACLU lawsuit. He said before making an arrest, ICE is required by law to have probable cause and to have determined the person is a flight risk. ICE agents in Colorado are doing neither, according to Meyer.

""ICE is breaking the rules and breaking the law when it's going out and conducting immigration enforcement,"" Meyer said. ""And that's why we're seeing these videos and reports showing that ICE is doing basically de facto racial profiling in communities throughout Colorado. That practice needs to stop and stop immediately.""

Meyer believes this lawsuit will work to get the missing guardrails back in place for immigration agents.

""We do think that if a court steps in and forces ICE to follow the law, it will restore balance with lawful law enforcement and respect for our constitutional protections,"" he said.

Ogden reached out to ICE for comment on the allegations and lawsuit.

And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.
The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.
Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.
He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state as part of its ongoing immigration enforcement push, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry is the latest setback for President Donald Trump, who has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as a security force, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

The temporary restraining order issued by Perry, which took effect immediately, bars the president from deploying federalized National Guard troops from any state to any location in Illinois. A written ruling would be issued Friday, she said.

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, “”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

Perry’s ruling “confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong — and there will be an appeal.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

It was not immediately clear what would happen with National Guard troops already working at sites around Chicago, including Broadview.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court ” due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Standing in front of a bevy of cameras Thursday evening in the federal court lobby — a building he noted that “doesn’t need the protection of the National Guard right now” — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s voice broke as he praised prosecutors he called “true American heroes.”

The judge’s ruling, Raoul said, “is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois but for the entire country. The question of state sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the president of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today.”

The ruling came down after hours of arguments in court that came to an emotional end Thursday with a lawyer for the Illinois attorney general choking up as he talked about the American tradition of public virtue that puts the common good of the republic ahead of self-interest.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” attorney Christopher Wells said in his closing argument in a shaky and halting voice.

Wells argued that Trump’s plan to put federalized National Guard troops in the Chicago area, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property during his “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement push, was a dangerous prelude to his real endgame: a federal takeover of Democrat-led cities like Chicago that have long been among his favorite political targets.

A Trump administration lawyer, meanwhile, argued strenuously that the president was well within his constitutional authority to mobilize troops given the violence perpetrated against federal immigration officers by protesters that he characterized as “rioters” and criminals bent on rebellion.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” said Eric Hamilton, a civil litigation attorney for the Department of Justice, citing the boxing in of vehicles, assaults and even an alleged bounty put on a border patrol official’s head by a reputed gang member.

Hamilton said the operation was limited in scope and entirely within the president’s powers to ensure the ability to execute federal laws, and that the state’s motion for an injunction blocking the National Guard deployment “entirely meritless.”

“There is no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the National Guard protecting federal property in a state of 13 million people,” Hamilton said.

The extraordinary back-and-forth between the lawyers capped a landmark day at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where Perry’s 17th floor courtroom quickly filled to capacity in advance of the hearing, as did an overflow courtroom three floors below.

The hearing also featured a remarkably detailed question-and-answer session between Perry and Hamilton, with the judge trying to pin him down on everything from what the troops would be doing in Chicago to the president’s own public statements about sending the military to the city to end crime.

Near the end of his remarks, Hamilton said that if the judge was inclined to issue an injunction it should be limited and narrowly tailored. He also asked that she put an administrative stay on any injunction so that it can be appealed quickly to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Arguments got underway shortly after 11 a.m. with the lawyers sparring over what constitutes a “rebellion” that such troops might be sent to quell.

Wells, the attorney for Illinois, said the country’s founders did not use words such as “rebellion, insurrection, or war” lightly.

“The president of the United States believes there is a rebellion brewing in the United States? That is such an audacious claim,” Wells argued. “Who are the rebels? Are the rebels well armed? … There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

“There doesn’t have to be an actual rebeller,” Hamilton said. “It is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here. Which there is.”

In requesting the emergency restraining order, Kwame Raoul’s office asked the federal court on Monday to find the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops unconstitutional and to block Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from deploying troops to the state over the objections of Pritzker.

“The Trump administration’s illegal actions already have subjected and are subjecting Illinois to serious and irreparable harm. The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.

But Department of Justice lawyers argued in a filing late Wednesday that escalating violence against immigration officials during “Operation Midway Blitz” justify the deployment of National Guard troops to protect against “a danger of a rebellion against federal authority” that impedes “the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law.

In their 59-page filing, the Justice Department cited the recent protests at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, charges against people accused of ramming Border Patrol vehicles on the city’s Southwest Side that led to a woman being shot by agents, and a case brought against an alleged Chicago gang member accusing him of putting a $10,000 bounty on the head of Bovino, the Border Patrol boss in charge of the Chicago operation.

The defendant in the Bovino case is scheduled to have a detention hearing Friday — apparently one of the cases that the Trump administration claims the National Guard was called in for.

“The violent actions and threats by large numbers of protesters, directed at those enforcing of federal immigration laws and at federal property, constitute at least a danger of a rebellion against federal authority and significantly impede the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law,” the Justice Department said in the filing.

Controversy was brewing before the hearing began Thursday. The Trump administration’s late-night filing included a declaration from a U.S. Army official claiming the National Guard had been requested to help secure the courthouse for two “high-profile cases” involving Department of Homeland Security personnel on Friday.

But in an apparent response, U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall said in a letter Thursday morning that the U.S. Marshals Service has jurisdiction over courthouse security.

“At no point did I, nor the Building Security Committee, authorize or request the National Guard’s assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Kendall wrote.

During the hearing Thursday, Perry grilled Hamilton, the Justice Department lawyer, about the claim, saying she’d been assured that it was “not an accurate statement.” She told Hamilton to go back to the Army official and either “provide further details for the factual basis” or withdraw it.

Before Perry came back to the bench to issue her ruling, the defense filed an updated declaration from the Army official clarifying that it was Federal Plaza, not the courthouse, that was at issue. “To date, there are no requests from the U.S. Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.

Perry spent well over an hour pressing Hamilton for specifics on the administration’s plans for the deployment. Would armed patrols be sent to neighborhood streets, she asked, or inside hospitals and schools? Would troops be able to search people or chase vehicles?

“You’re the ones who are deploying them,” she replied. “What are they being trained and deployed to do?”

Hamilton said it was too early to say exactly what Guard members would be asked to do and where they might be sent. Still, he said the mission would center on protecting federal buildings and federal agents who have been subjected to “very tragic and serious acts of violence,” including what he classified as coordinated attempts to block and ram DHS vehicles and an improvised explosive device described in court documents as “a round, green ball with a wick” found last month outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview.

But Perry noted at least some of that violence appeared to be instigated by federal agents. The judge referenced evidence of ICE agents “indiscriminately gassing” peaceful protestors outside the Broadview center as well as several recent cases in which citizens had been charged with assaulting immigration agents only to have a grand jury later find no probable cause that a crime had been committed.

She also pushed Hamilton to reconcile the administration’s legal arguments for the deployment with public statements made by Trump, who in the past has said Guard troops would be asked to tackle Chicago’s endemic crime.

“Frankly,” she said, “there’s a very large disconnect between those two bodies of evidence.”

As with much of the questioning, Hamilton fell back on the position that the president’s authority to federalize the National Guard is not for a judge to decide. And even when the question has been put to judicial review, the president has been given “great deference” to determine when the Guard should be deployed.

In this case, he told Perry, Trump has decided the Guard is needed to protect federal property in Illinois and to ensure that DHS agents are able to enforce federal immigration laws.

“I am very much struggling to figure out where this would ever stop,” Perry said. “The plaintiffs really believe it’s not going to stop with that. You haven’t told me it’s going to stop after that.”

Perry later questioned whether the level of violence reportedly faced by federal agents was enough to deter ICE agents from making arrests, which have dramatically spiked this year.

Acts of vandalism — slashed tires and keyed cars — sounded “a bit like a Carrie Underwood song,” she joked, eliciting a brief chuckle in a packed court room that, until that moment, had been silently tense. “I struggle to say you can’t execute laws because you can’t do it as quickly as you’d like,” Perry said.

Ahead of Perry’s expected ruling, Mayor Brandon Johnson appeared outside Funston Elementary School, near the scene of ICE’s tear gas deployment last week, and affirmed that Chicago police will protect protesters’ rights outside the Dirksen Courthouse and citywide.

“It is the local police department’s responsibility to ensure that we keep the peace, and that’s what they’ll do, and that’s what their assignment is,” Johnson told reporters.

He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.

“I mean, you saw them in D.C. They were streets and sanitation workers,” Johnson said. “Here’s the thing, that you don’t need a uniform to volunteer to pick up trash.”

Johnson watched much of the hearing in a back pew. He sat quietly, leaning forward as he intently watched Perry question the sparring attorneys.

He left before closing arguments, praising the judge to reporters in the courthouse lobby, but adding concerns that even with an order from her Trump might still break rules.

“This administration has made it very clear that its sole intent is to be an authoritarian government, versus a democracy,” he said. “I believe that we all should be concerned about that.”

The Defense Department has moved in recent days to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard as well as 400 Guard members from Texas. Approximately half of the Guard members from Texas ultimately are expected to be sent to Illinois, with the support of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump suggested he could invoke the Insurrection Act if needed to sidestep court orders or uncooperative officials.

“If I had to enact it, I’d do it, if people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up,” he said.

A White House spokeswoman repeated that Trump was exercising “his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.”

Given Trump’s weekslong flirtation with sending troops to Chicago and his shifting rationale, which at first was ostensibly about combating violent crime in the city but has since turned to protecting immigration enforcement operations amid “Operation Midway Blitz,” “the manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the state argued in its filing.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote.

The state’s filing noted Trump’s long history of “threatening and derogatory statements toward” Illinois and Chicago, as well as city and state leaders, dating to even before he entered the 2016 presidential race.

“The supposed current emergency is belied by the fact that Trump’s Chicago troop deployment threats began more than ten years ago,” the state argued. “In a social media post from 2013 Trump writes ‘we need our troops on the streets of Chicago, not in Syria.’”

The state lawsuit also turned the Trump administration’s braggadocio to undermine its argument that troops are necessary, citing statements touting the successes of recent immigration enforcement activities and a “confident show of force” on Sept. 28, during which “dozens of DHS agents dressed in tactical gear and carrying semi-automatic rifles walked the streets of downtown,” as evidence that no emergency exists that would require the deployment of federalized troops.

In a show of unity, U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, a veteran wounded in combat in Iraq, and all 14 Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to Trump that urged the president to reverse course.

During a cabinet meeting Thursday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her department is looking to purchase additional facility space in the city.

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, meeting with state and local leaders like Mayor Keith Wilson, Gov. Tina Kotek, Portland Police Chief Bob Day and Oregon State Police Superintendent Casey Codding. The discussions centered on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Waterfront, which has been the site of frequent protests since June.

In Thursday’s cabinet meeting, Noem called the local leaders ""lying and disingenuous and dishonest people.""

""As soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response, so we're looking at new facilities to purchase there in Portland, too, and we're gonna double down,"" she said. ""I told them if they didn't meet our demands for safety and security on the streets and work with us then we were going to bring in more federal law enforcement.""

Following her visit, Noem said in a FOX News interview that she wanted more security at the facility, including a larger ""buffer zone,"" claiming that Portland police had been ""leaving (federal) officers hung out to dry."" She also wants designated ""free speech zones"" where people would be allowed to protest.

In that interview, Noem threatened to send ""four times the amount of federal officers"" to Portland if Wilson didn't comply with her demands in the FOX News interview.

In addition to Portland, Noem said Thursday that the federal government is looking to expand facilities in Chicago, where National Guard troops were recently deployed.

""If we have to do it the hard way in Portland and Chicago, we will,"" she said.

'It hurts our hearts to the core'

Outside the South Waterfront ICE facility on Thursday, protesters signaled that they aren't going to let up, no matter the administration's characterizations.

""I've been here pretty close almost close to 100 days myself,"" said Shadow, one of the protesters.

""This is not some battleground that we have here; there's nothing on fire,"" said Nancy Burris. She explained her handmade sign. ""It says, 'We the people are ashamed of ICE.' We are — our whole nation is embarrassed right now.""

Shadow acknowledged that things get more ""hectic"" at night. More anti-ICE protesters come down, but so do supporters of the Trump administration — and federal officers always make an appearance.

Over Wednesday night, the Portland Police Bureau said they arrested three people on harassment charges, booking them in the Multnomah County jail. Just before 11 p.m. they arrested another person who allegedly shined a laser at the PPB surveillance plane circling overhead.

The FBI said that federal law enforcement made no arrests at all Wednesday. In general, they've been responsible for the bulk of arrests there since June — 179, by their count. But only 31 of those arrests, or 17%, have resulted in any federal charges. The rest were released with a citation or without charge.

As for who's making trouble when trouble does flare up, it depends on who you ask.

""Just a lot of agitation from both the right wingers, mostly the right-wingers,"" said Shadow.

Conservative influencers who spoke with KGW earlier in the week denied being agitators, saying it's the other way around.

Margaret Salazar is CEO of REACH Community Development, which runs an affordable housing complex directly across the street where more than 200 people live. For her tenants, the problem has less to do with the protesters and counter-protesters, and more to do with the feds.

""Really, the prominent thing that we are hearing about is the tear gas that is actually encroaching into residential units and making it difficult for folks to breathe,"" Salazar said.

The Portland Housing Bureau is now giving REACH $55,000 toward buying air cleaners. The city also sent a crew Thursday to clean the sidewalks outside.

""What we are seeing is that there's debris from the pepper balls and tear gas canisters that is basically littered here by federal agents, and the federal agents are not cleaning up their toxic trash,"" Salazar said. ""It hurts our hearts to the core to know that residents are experiencing this.""

'No interest in facts'

In statements on Wednesday, Mayor Keith Wilson signaled that he does not intend to comply with the administration's requests to expand the security perimeter or restrict protest areas around the ICE facility.

Meanwhile, as of Thursday, a city spokesperson said that they've received no indication thus far that the federal government intends to buy property in Portland. The spokesperson added that Wilson stands by his earlier statement:

""The federal government's actions in Portland are deeply disturbing. They undermine local authority, erode public trust, and escalate tensions rather than resolve them.""

The spokesperson also said Wilson urges federal partners to ""engage constructively"" and to ""refrain from rhetoric that misrepresents our city's leadership and values.""

In response to Noem's comments, Kotek said in a statement:

""I met with Secretary Noem during her visit to stand up for Oregonians' safety, deescalate the situation perpetuated by the Trump administration, and raise concerns about the aggressive tactics that federal officers are using against peaceful protesters such as tear gas and unprovoked physical force.

""It is clear from Secretary Noem's continued false narrative about what's happening in Portland that the Trump Administration has no interest in the facts, no interest in public safety, and that we cannot take them at their word. I support the Mayor's decision to hold the line in response to the Trump Administration's lies and aggressive tactics. I am calling on President Trump and his administration to focus on real problems, not made-up ones.""

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement:

""Chief Bob Day is a 35-year law enforcement veteran who came out of retirement out of a deep commitment to help lead the Portland Police Bureau through this period of renewal for our city. He continues to serve with integrity, honesty, and genuine curiosity. Chief Day requested the meeting with the secretary in the spirit of respectful dialogue.""

Trump's cabinet meeting

During Thursday’s cabinet meeting, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi referenced the ongoing federal case over deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland.

""The (local) government doesn't want it there, but we do. We're gonna keep those citizens safe,"" she said.

""The people want it,"" President Donald Trump said in response. ""I don't understand the politics of it.""

""I asked the mayor (Wilson) that himself (regarding troop deployment),"" Noem said. ""'He said that Portland was 'perfectly safe, a beautiful city, no problems.' And I said then why did you clear the streets for me today (Tuesday) then and build out a four-block radius to make sure that I could get in and out of here and these people on the street screaming death to ICE?""

A one-block radius was blocked off around the ICE facility during Noem's visit and into the next morning. In a news release Wednesday morning, PPB said the blockade would likely stay that way for now — but that same evening, barriers were removed and all roads around the facility reopened.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.

The combination of Trump’s policies leads to lower growth and higher inflation, which when combined with persistent unemployment can create stagflation, the worst thing that can happen to an economy.
The poor jobs numbers that drive Trump mad and make Wall Street nervous are actually good enough after all.
If decreased immigration’s impacts on the labor market are lasting, that means America’s economic engine has lost horsepower.","Demographic changes are hitting America hard as the largest generation ever (up until their children) ages into retirement. An aging population is the short story of why everyone is terrified to buy 20- and 30-year European bonds right now, because the simple fact is that healthy long-term economic growth is dependent on having a growing and robust labor force of working age. As the Dallas Fed notes, we saw this demographic change hit America before Trump did, as “In late 2023 and early 2024, when actual payroll growth frequently fell below the elevated break-even estimate, the unemployment rate correspondingly drifted higher.” That is a dynamic that suggests boomers are leaving the labor force for retirement.

But unemployment has not drifted higher in 2025 alongside payroll growth falling below estimates. As Cheremukhin notes, this “provides important external validation for my measure.” He created a methodology from natural population change, legal immigration and net unauthorized immigration represented in that line above which “shows a significantly higher peak in 2023 and a much steeper fall into 2025 compared with series based on official sources.” A different group of analysts at the Dallas Fed earlier this year detailed how “Declining immigration weighs on GDP growth, with little impact on inflation,” combining to create a pretty unsettling reality in plain English for the American economy.

Namely that the tepid jobs numbers this year trend more towards a new normal than an outlier, and the declining economic growth this dynamic brings with it doesn’t even lower inflation either. This is not some abstract economic dynamic constrained to a Fed paper, you can see it for yourself in farmers on the verge of bankruptcy amidst all time high beef prices and inflation persisting around 3 percent while the Fed says they fear inflation risks to the upside, signaling that they may be cautious in further cutting rates to try to spur our slowing economy. The combination of Trump’s policies leads to lower growth and higher inflation, which when combined with persistent unemployment can create stagflation, the worst thing that can happen to an economy.

But the…good news? I guess? Is that this new Dallas Fed paper suggests that the tepid jobs growth we are currently experiencing is actually enough to keep the unemployment rate constant and us away from stagflation. It’s just one paper zooming in on a new two-year dynamic, but that it spans across two very different presidencies seeing different unemployment trends makes it significant. That there are external confirmations for Cheremukhin’s methodology make this a pretty compelling and bleak depiction of what the American economy actually looks like going into 2026. The poor jobs numbers that drive Trump mad and make Wall Street nervous are actually good enough after all.

Immigration is an economic superpower. It’s what separates America from the rest of the world. Last year the Congressional Budget Office found that “An increase in immigration over the 2021–2026 period boosts federal revenues as well as mandatory spending and interest on the debt in CBO’s baseline projections, lowering deficits, on net, by $0.9 trillion over the 2024–2034 period.” If you can get a steady flow of the globe’s best and brightest, you are less subject to the swings of population trends inside your borders. Only a doofus who knows literally nothing about economics would think that less immigration is good for our economy long-term, yet here Republicans are bankrupting their own voters and betraying them for Argentina as they prove themselves to be economic frauds time and time again.

If decreased immigration’s impacts on the labor market are lasting, that means America’s economic engine has lost horsepower. We could still grow the economy to degrees we have in the past, which is the great hope/lie of AI, but without growth in the labor force and the natural feedback loop that creates with spending that gets recycled through the economy, economic growth without bringing inflation along with it becomes more difficult to accomplish. If you are piling 1934-stuyle tariffs on top of that dynamic, it is akin to pouring stagflationary gasoline on a fire that can stay lit long after Trump has left office depending on how much the rest of the word hates us now.

America used to be the immigration capital of the world, now that’s not so certain given how one party here has made it clear they are fine throwing the rest of the world in foreign gulags if they travel here. Immigration is (was?) our economic secret weapon. Now the nativist GOP wants America to look more like nativist aging Europe whose long-term bonds have fewer buyers today than they did yesterday every day, bringing depressed European economic growth and its lack of long-term investment over the Atlantic. This year’s economic trends fueled by changes in immigration have proven that it is not at all inaccurate to say that the Trump and his enablers like racism more than they like money, and they may have permanently damaged the economy because of it.",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/10/Fresh_Mark_Worksite_Enforcement_in_Salem_Ohio_50044087573-ICE-DHS.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:58:54.721622

The Senate took its seventh round of votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to restart the funding, but neither won enough bipartisan support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the chamber. In a sign that neither party had budged from its demands, no senators changed their votes from when the bills were last considered in recent days.

Government funding lapsed last Wednesday, and Republicans are insisting Senate Democrats approve a bill to continue operations through 21 November, which has already cleared the House of Representatives. But Democrats say any government funding deal must be paired with an extension of premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans, which expire at the end of the year.

They are also demanding that funding for public media outlets be restored and cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program for poor and disabled Americans are reversed.

Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until the government is reopened, and during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump repeated his threat to single out Democratic-led states and cities for retaliation, if their lawmakers do not back down.

“We will be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you,” he said. “So they will get a little taste of their own medicine.”

The Senate’s top Democrat Chuck Schumer projected confidence in the party’s strategy, telling Punchbowl News: “Every day gets better for us.”

Republicans seized on that remark as evidence that the minority party is careless of the economic impacts of the shutdown. Federal workers are expected to miss a paycheck next week if funding is not restarted in the coming days.

“It’s so stunning to me how callous he can be to play political games and use American citizens as the pawns in a political game,” Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference.

The White House office of management and budget has cancelled federal funding for projects in several Democratic-led jurisdictions since the shutdown started, but does not yet appear to have followed through on its threat to carry out mass firings of government workers.

In a bid to convince Senate Democrats to drop their demands, Johnson has kept the House of Representatives out of session since the shutdown began, since any compromise bill would need his chamber’s approval. He signaled he would extend the recess into next week if funding was not restored.

The unspecified real estate effort could potentially expand the federal government’s footprint beyond the suburban Broadview facility that has become the focal point of local protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“We’re purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of,” Noem told Trump during an open Cabinet meeting. “We’re gonna not back off. In fact, we’re doubling down and we’re gonna be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

Encounters between federal agents and protesters in Broadview occasionally have grown hostile over the past month, with masked officers often escalating tense physical confrontations with civilians trying to disrupt the agency’s enhanced deportation operation.

National Guard troops federalized by Trump have been assigned to Broadview to protect ICE agents, though protests largely have been peaceful, with only dozens in attendance over the past few days.

Conservative social media influencers who have been granted access to the deportation campaign shared videos last week of Noem and other officials scouting vacant warehouses around Chicago as potential ICE processing centers. It’s not clear where the feds are looking to expand.

“I was there a few days ago and looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of. Because what they’re trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out on the streets,” Noem said.

Trump initially cited crime in Chicago as the impetus to send in the Guard over the strong opposition of Gov. JB Pritzker and other local officials, despite the fact violent crime has fallen steadily over the past few years.

During a federal court hearing over Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s lawsuit seeking to block the deployment, an attorney for Trump’s Justice Department said the mission for troops who arrived in the city this week is to protect federal agents and property.

“I don’t understand why Pritzker is trying to protect people that are really bad people,” Trump said, nodding at Noem’s suggestion that the Democratic governor is being swayed by “anarchists that are on the street.”

“I think Pritzker’s threatened by people, because there’s no other reason that this could be possible, that they don’t want to have a safe Chicago,” Trump said. “And we can solve the problem very quickly, and we’re doing that anyway, regardless of if he doesn’t want it, or if he does want it, we’re doing it anyway.”

At an unrelated press conference, Pritzker said Trump administration officials “are just looking for ways to provoke people.”

“If they can plant troops or agents in place where there might be the prospect of people being upset — and by the way, there’s a high prospect in the city of Chicago, in fact, across the state of Illinois, [of] people being upset about having troops posted in front of them in a way that’s never been done before — I think that’s what their aim is, is to try to provoke something,” Pritzker said. “There are a whole lot of peaceful protests that have gone on and peaceful protesters, and I want to emphasize peaceful. That’s what they’re doing.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d599e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6924x3953+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2F45%2F4ff31121419eb6c7b97632e8b589%2Fnoemchicago-080925-023.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:56:40.635873

As James mounted a lawsuit claiming that Trump's business persona was built partly on lies, he returned fire, calling her “grossly incompetent” and “an evil person.""

James, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been legal and political foes, tangling in dozens of lawsuits over the years.

On Thursday, Trump's Justice Department indicted James on mortgage fraud charges after he vowed revenge on his enemies, escalating a feud that has persisted since she campaigned for attorney general in 2018. She has denied wrongdoing.

Here's a look at some of James and Trump's legal tussles:

A lawsuit accusing Trump of lying about his wealth

James sued Trump after his first term, alleging in September 2022 that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars by misleading banks and insurers about the value of assets such as Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. She dubbed it “The art of the steal,” a twist on the title of Trump's memoir. After a trial, a judge ordered Trump last year to pay a massive monetary penalty. An appeals court later threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than $500 million with interest, but affirmed a lower-court finding that Trump committed fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the penalty, while Trump is seeking to have other non-monetary punishments lifted.

Face-to-face at a deposition, fireworks in a courtroom

Trump sparred with James at a deposition for her civil fraud lawsuit in April 2023. Answering questions for seven hours at her Manhattan office, he told her that “the whole case is crazy” and accused her staff of trying to trip him up like fictional TV lawyer Perry Mason did to witnesses. A few months later, they came face-to-face again as Trump testified at trial. Trump looked away from James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he accused her of pursuing him to advance her career. “She’s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,” he testified, adding that James “should be ashamed of herself.”

A leading role fighting Trump administration policies

Working with a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, James sued Trump and his administration multiple times since he returned to the White House in January, challenging everything from cuts to funding for counterterrorism and public safety to plans to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon. Those efforts began the day after Trump took office with a lawsuit challenging his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Other lawsuits have challenged the work of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, mass firings of federal workers and the revocation of temporary protected status for Venezuelans.

Dozens of lawsuits in Trump's first term

During his first term, James sued the administration at least 66 times in a two-year span, challenging policies on environmental, immigration and education policy, health care and other issues. She fought his plans to include a question about immigration status on the Census, winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, and sued the U.S. Postal Service over slowdowns before the 2020 election. Other major victories during the first term included restoring what’s known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, which allows people who came to the country unlawfully as children to remain, and a ruling that barred immigration authorities from arresting people at courthouses.

Helping build a criminal case against Trump's company

James teamed with then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer. The company was convicted in 2022 of helping its executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. James assigned two lawyers to work with Vance’s office after uncovering evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing. James was not involved when Trump was prosecuted last year by Alvin Bragg, the current District Attorney, and convicted of falsifying business records.

Closing down Trump's charity over misspending

In 2019, James finalized an agreement brokered by her predecessor dissolving his charitable foundation and forcing him to pay $2 million to various nonprofits as a fine for misspending funds to further his political and business interests. The Trump Foundation’s $1.7 million in remaining funds were also given away. Trump acknowledged in a court filing that he allowed campaign staff to coordinate with the charity for a veterans fundraiser before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. He also admitted to arranging for it to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) portrait of him and the spending of $11,525 in foundation funds on sports memorabilia and Champagne at a charity gala.

Trump fights back, but judges reject his lawsuits

Trump sued James in 2021 in an attempt to block her from investigating him and his businesses. After a federal judge in New York quickly threw out the case, Trump sued her again in Florida. A judge there refused to block the probe, writing in December 2022: “This litigation has all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.” Trump abandoned efforts to revive his first lawsuit against James after the Florida judge rejected a lawsuit he filed against his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. In tossing that case, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ordered Trump and one of his lawyers — Alina Habba, currently acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey — to pay nearly $1 million for filing frivolous lawsuits for political purposes, which the judge said amounted to a “pattern of abuse of the courts.”

Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided.
Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.
Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea.","Zip ties. Helicopters. Crowded cells. Guns trained on bewildered workers. Foul water. Forced vaccinations. An unconscious detainee left on the floor by negligent guards. A pregnant woman in handcuffs. A detainee being called “Rocket Man” (Donald Trump’s nickname for Kim Jong Un) by sneering federal agents. A menstruating woman forced to attend to her period with only toilet paper.

These are the details of 316 South Korean nationals’ experiences in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that have flooded the country’s media in the weeks after the September 4 raid on a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. A wave of fury is now pouring forth from across South Korean society — and the political consequences are only just beginning.

There is far more at stake than a single factory in Georgia, which by itself represented 8,500 jobs and $4.3 billion in investment, and is just one of 23 plants being built across the U.S. by Korean conglomerates. Since the raid, the U.S. and South Korea have announced that Korean workers will be able to use B-1 visas and ESTA visa waivers to continue working in the U.S. A new bill in Congress, the Partner with Korea Act, also seeks to extend 15,000 professional E-4 visas to South Koreans for the first time.

But U.S. flexibility on immigration is not all that matters. Seoul and Washington have yet to finalize their trade deal instigated by Trump’s threat to impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on South Korean goods. At the current stage of negotiations, South Korea has agreed to accept a 15 percent tariff on its exports and provide tremendous investments and other financial agreements: $350 billion in state-backed short-term investment, $150 billion in private sector contracts with U.S. corporations, and a guarantee to purchase $100 billion in U.S. liquid natural gas. Despite so much on the table, a written agreement has yet to be produced, and negotiations are proving tense as the Trump administration presses for Seoul to provide the lion’s share of its $350 billion commitment in cash. While some of the shock over the ICE raid has died down, Washington’s conduct over the course of months of negotiations has also raised deeper questions in South Korea about the real nature of the alliance — and whether this is a relationship that can last.

The Art of the Steal

The anger unleashed by ICE’s abuse of Korean workers has been building for some time. Trump’s tariff threats, announced in March, hit South Korea at a difficult time, when the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was unresolved, and the country was reeling from years of flagging economic performance.

The issue was not only a matter of timing. The Biden administration’s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act also used similar (though less onerous) tariff threats to force South Korean conglomerates to transfer production and make large investments in the U.S. — which is how the Hyundai-LG plant made its way to Georgia in the first place. Having already complied with the previous administration, South Korea nevertheless now finds itself facing an even graver economic threat that could lead to recession: not just a 25 percent tariff on all exports (since reduced to 15 percent), but sector-based tariffs impacting most of South Korea’s key industries as well.

While much of the anger on either side of the Pacific has focused on the current administration in Washington, Trump’s tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

The 1997 International Monetary Fund crisis is the most notorious of these, and led to the “irregularization” of nearly half the workforce as employers moved to subcontracting and other forms of indirect employment to dodge existing labor law and deny rights to their workers. The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers. With Joe Biden, and now Trump, the U.S. has moved to maintain its privileges under the agreement while subjecting South Korea to unequal burdens and penalties.

As with prior rounds of U.S. economic warfare, South Korea’s workers and other affected sectors of society responded to the tariffs with force. Farmers reacted with rancor to demands to open up the rice and beef markets to U.S. imports; civic groups staged protests at the U.S. embassy; peace groups highlighted the military demands attached to the tariff threats; and unions educated their workforces and, in some cases, moved to partial strike action — as with the case of General Motors Korea.

Like most governments, South Korea opted to appease the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15 percent, with no corresponding tariff on U.S. goods in the Korean market. So far, Seoul has offered to inject a cumulative $600 billion into the U.S. economy. This is a dizzying figure for any country, no less for South Korea with an annual GDP of roughly $1.7 trillion in 2023, and an annual budget of roughly $500 billion in 2024.

According to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the $350 billion in short-term state-backed investments offered by South Korea is more than the total direct investments it made worldwide over the five-year period from 2020-2024. Beyond extracting such an enormous tribute, Washington has cast a covetous eye toward South Korea’s most valuable and strategic industries, seeking to either smother them through tariffs or transfer their most lucrative parts of the production chain to the U.S.: in shipbuilding, automobiles, steel, and more.

While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung attempted to spin the deal as a victory, the domestic labor movement and many progressives swiftly rejected this. The minority Progressive Party, which holds seats in the National Assembly, denounced Trump’s tariff maneuvers as “an act of plunder.” The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a massive umbrella union representing over a million workers, described the “unilateral” negotiations as “humiliating,” and criticized the government’s declaration of victory as an attempt to confuse the public, since the 15 percent tariff is still ultimately an increase that will burden Korean industry and workers.

Fraying Bonds?

At the outset of Trump’s tariff threats, labor, farmers, and progressive civil society organizations spearheaded vocal opposition. South Korea’s conglomerates (or chaebol) opted to hedge against further potential losses by adopting conciliatory rhetoric and offering handsome investment packages before the details of a deal were worked out at the state level. This was reflected in Lee’s first summit with Trump in August, which was noted for its convivial atmosphere and his lavish praise of Trump. Pressure to transfer production to the U.S. was no doubt uncomfortable for South Korea’s capitalists, but for a moment, an illusion endured that profits might be sustained in the long term. Then came the ICE raid in Georgia — not only raising questions about the safety of the workforce, but also raising questions about investments.

This precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea. Right-wing papers and business media outlets released a barrage of editorials in the wake of the raid. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s conservative paper of record, said the raid “raises fundamental questions about what the United States truly means by ‘alliance.’” Even the People Power Party, whose former leader, ex-President Yoon, now sits in jail, spoke out against the incident.

Some even went as far as to speculate whether the ICE raid might have had something to do with the unsettled tariff negotiations. The Korea Economic Daily, one of South Korea’s most important business papers, left little room for subtlety in its editorial: “If the US attempts to leverage this incident in trade negotiations, such as the $350 billion US investment fund and the further liberalization of agricultural and livestock products, it would be a betrayal of the trust of the alliance.” While this statement falls short of an outright accusation in print, one wonders what might have been said in more private settings among the elite.

Despite the pivot in South Korean public opinion, Washington has since only doubled down. Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided. Trump has long claimed that he will personally determine the allocation of South Korea’s investments, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick previously tweeted that “90 percent” of the profits will go to “the American people” — a point that continues to rankle South Koreans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick is also applying additional pressure to get Seoul to further raise its investments. Trump has no doubt taken confidence in his success in getting Japan to agree to similar terms, under which its $550 billion tariff tribute will be distributed according to the decisions of a U.S. committee — with Japanese input relegated to only a consultative position. If this all sounds bizarre and corrupt, that’s because it is. While Trump has touted his tariff deals as the prelude to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, a better way to see them may be as just another handout for Wall Street — this time subsidized by taxpayers worldwide.

Now, the Trump administration is demanding that the majority of Seoul’s $350 billion investment be made “up front” in cash. Though an arrangement based on some credit is more likely, if handed over in full, the $350 billion would represent 83 percent of South Korea’s foreign reserves, threatening to trigger a currency crisis for the Korean won. Lee’s government has rejected this demand and countered with an offer for an unlimited currency swap to protect the value of his country’s currency, but the Trump administration has so far refused.

As negotiations drag on, Lee faces growing pressure to adopt a more assertive stance — including from within his own Democratic Party. For a moment, Lee put up more combative rhetoric, telling the Korean press he would not accept “any irrational or unfair negotiations,” and noted that, “We did not go to the US to gain anything, but to defend ourselves against the US’ unilateral tariff increases.” In a separate statement, Lee’s office indicated it would be willing to accept a 25 percent tariff to the U.S. market if the alternative were overly detrimental to South Korea. And in a much-circulated Facebook post, Lee called for a “self-reliant” South Korean military while castigating the “submissive mindset of some who think that self-defense is impossible without foreign troops” — a statement widely interpreted as made in reference to U.S. Forces Korea, which stations over 28,000 permanent U.S. troops in South Korea in more than 60 military bases.

Lee’s rhetoric is certainly sharpening, but his administration isn’t done with the U.S., or Trump, just yet. There are real obstacles preventing a sudden strategic shift from Washington. Lee’s economic program pegs South Korea’s future competitiveness to massive investments in AI and associated hardware, and recent deals with BlackRock and Open AI would provide the capital for the necessary data infrastructure and chip production.

More immediately, South Korea needs to diversify its trade partners to soften the blows of the U.S. tariff cudgel. Exports rallied to a new monthly record high in September, buoyed by a sharp rise in trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, and more modest gains in trade with China. Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea’s military — something Lee has vowed to recover more than 20 years since Washington first agreed to a process for transferring military control.

A disadvantageous deal for South Korea may yet be in the offing, but a victory on trade may prove pyrrhic for Washington. For its part, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has unambiguously called for Seoul’s investment pledges to be withdrawn. Should a potential deal fail to spark public ire immediately, ample opportunities will remain. Trump’s demands go far beyond economic matters. The U.S. is also calling for South Korea to raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP (Lee has already taken steps towards this, increasing defense spending by 8.2 percent in next year’s budget); raise its annual military “cost-sharing” payments to the U.S. to $10 billion a year; and consent to changes in U.S. Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.

Out of all these demands, the proposed change in the mission of U.S. Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea. By redefining the mission of the U.S. occupation of Korea, South Korea would essentially lose any ability to avoid a U.S.-China war, since its territory would become part of a battlefield of Washington’s making. Lee has consistently maintained that South Korea should stay out of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which Washington has not been shy about as its rationale for pursuing “strategic flexibility” in Korea. As U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson put it, to the U.S. military in the New Cold War, South Korea is akin to a “fixed aircraft carrier” whose geographical position makes it indispensable to dominating the region.

The ICE raid and trade wars alone will not undo the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, but they will likely persist as an open wound marring the relationship for years to come. As Washington presses on with its efforts to economically cannibalize Seoul and impose its military exigencies in preparation for wars few Koreans or Americans want, something will have to give. Whether that will be the alliance and the U.S. empire of bases, or whatever vestiges of democracy that remain in both countries, only time will tell.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234317168-1536x985.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 01:56:43.363381

In Memphis, Tennessee, Paul Young, the city’s mayor, said national guard members would begin patrolling on Friday.","A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from federalizing or deploying the national guard in Illinois after Donald Trump ordered hundreds of troops to Chicago to help with immigration enforcement and to battle what the White House says are high crime rates in the city.

US district judge April Perry issued her decision from the bench after more than two hours of arguments from lawyers for the federal government and the state of Illinois, which sued the Trump administration over the deployment. The order took effect on Thursday and will remain in place for two weeks.

According to reporters present in the courtroom, Perry said she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. On Thursday evening, around the time of Perry’s ruling, about half a dozen guard soldiers were milling around inside the gate at the Ice center in Broadview. A group of about 10 protesters were outside.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker said in a statement: “Donald Trump is not a king – and his administration is not above the law.”

Quoting the judge, he said: “Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago.”

Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, who attended the court hearing, called the decision a “win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law”. He vowed that the city would “continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration’s war on Chicago”.

Lawyers for the state of Illinois had called the sending of national guard soldiers to the city – which was opposed by Chicago and state political leaders – a constitutional crisis.

The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.” Chicago and Illinois, run by Democratic elected leaders, say Trump has exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the national guard off the streets.

Eric Hamilton, a justice department lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They’re not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

In handing down her order, Perry assailed the Department of Homeland Security for providing a version of events on the ground that was “simply unreliable”.

Lawyers for Illinois and local officials have said the government is exaggerating and misrepresenting the situation in Chicago, which Trump has referred to as a “war zone”.

Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said the president had “exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets” and “will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities”. She added that the president and his administration “expect to be vindicated by the court” upon appeal.

National guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a US army reserve center in Elwood, south-west of Chicago. All 500 national guard members are under the US northern command and have been activated for 60 days.

Earlier this week, Trump said Johnson and Pritzker should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor have signed an appeals court filing in support of the legal challenge by California – and also one in the Portland, Oregon, where a similar troop deployment is also being challenged.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

In a separate ruling on Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction restricting agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Ellis’s order covers all of northern Illinois and also requires federal agents to wear “visible identification” such as badges, the subject of heated debate as viral footage has surfaced of masked, plainclothes officers carrying out immigration enforcements in several US cities.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington DC. In Memphis, Tennessee, Paul Young, the city’s mayor, said national guard members would begin patrolling on Friday. Bill Lee, Tennessee’s Republican governor, supports using the troops.

It’s a victory for Democratic officials who lead the state and city and have traded insults with President Donald Trump about his drive to put troops on the ground in major urban areas.

“The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Gov. JB Pritzker said.

The judge said the administration violated the 10th Amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th Amendment, which assures due process and equal protection.

It wasn’t clear what the troops will do now, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

Guard was already in Illinois

The lawsuit was filed Monday by Chicago and Illinois as Guard members from Texas and Illinois were on their way to a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and had been activated for 60 days.

Some slept in vans Wednesday night outside the Broadview building, near Chicago, and emerged Thursday morning on patrol behind portable fences. For weeks, the ICE site has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Guard’s mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. But Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton told the judge.

Perry, however, wasn’t swayed.

“I have seen no critical evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” she said hours later.

Order could be extended

The judge said the order would expire on Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. She set an Oct. 22 hearing by telephone to determine if the order should be extended for another 14 days.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in Trump’s ""animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” said Perry, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sat in a corner of the courtroom, which overflowed into a room with video of the hearing.

The city and state have called the deployments unnecessary and illegal.

“The president does not have the unfettered discretion to turn America’s military against its own citizens when they exercise their constitutional rights,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime despite statistics that show a significant drop in crime. He said Pritzker and Johnson should be arrested for not protecting agents during immigration sweeps. Pritzker's response: “Come and get me.”

Court challenges elsewhere

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court heard arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

A judge on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

Chicago’s federal court issued other decisions this week related to immigration enforcement. In one, a judge said immigration agents have repeatedly violated a 2022 consent decree outlining how ICE can make so-called warrantless arrests. That decree requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes for people besides those being targeted.

Immigrant advocacy groups believe hundreds of people arrested around Chicago could qualify for reduced bond or have ankle monitors removed.

Guard expected on ground in Memphis

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Tennessee, Memphis Mayor Paul Young said troops would begin patrolling Friday. Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the role.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped the Guard would direct traffic and have a presence in retail corridors, but not set up checkpoints or make the city “feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities.”

In a California case, a judge in September said the deployment was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave.

G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo.","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado and migrant advocates filed a lawsuit against three Trump administration officials on Thursday, alleging that federal immigration officers are violating the law in arresting migrants in the state.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado, lists Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons and ICE’s Denver field office Director Robert Guadian as defendants.

Citing the cases of four migrants who have been detained by ICE in Colorado this year, the ACLU suit attests that ICE officers are ignoring Title 8, Section 1357 of the U.S. Code. The statute requires that federal immigration officials have probable cause to believe an individual is in the country illegally and likely to escape before a warrant is obtained in order to arrest them.

When reached for comment, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told The Hill that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

According to the latest ICE data, officers from the Denver field office have arrested 15,756 individuals across their jurisdiction in Wyoming and Colorado. According to the complaint, ICE arrested nearly 2,000 individuals in Colorado in the first half of the year.

The ACLU and advocates filed the lawsuit on behalf of 43-year-old Refugio Ramirez Ovando, 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves, 36-year-old J.S.T. and 32-year-old G.R.R. All four have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade and were detained by ICE officers earlier this year.

Ramirez was detained without a warrant in May and held at an ICE detention facility in Aurora, Colo. for more than three months, before an officer admitted to mistaking him for someone else. Dias Goncalves, a student at the University of Utah, was arrested by ICE officers while driving in June and spent 15 days at the Aurora facility.

J.S.T., going by a pseudonym, was arrested at his apartment complex in February and spent four weeks in the Aurora facility. G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. He later spent six weeks in Aurora.

The lawsuit claims that instead of following immigration law, ICE is “scrambling to fill arbitrary quotes set by the Administration, causing chaos and terror in neighborhoods throughout Colorado.” It adds that the roughly 169,000 immigrants without legal status and other Latinos in the state “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices.”

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said the administration’s goal is for ICE to arrest 3,000 individuals per day.

“ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,” the suit added.

Trump could also tap other executive authority to mobilize troops to support his immigration crackdown.

Driving the news: Judge April Perry in her oral ruling Thursday, granted Illinois and co-plaintiffs in part, an emergency motion to stop the president from deploying troops.

Her written ruling is expected Friday.

""If deputies encounter undocumented aliens during regular criminal enforcement, they may detain them for removal proceedings,"" said Sheriff Brian Kozak.

Earlier this month, Kozak and 25 deputies reaffirmed their pledge to obey and enforce the Constitution, prohibiting any type of profiling or discrimination.

""We will have zero tolerance on profiling or discrimination with enforcement,"" said Kozak.

Deputies may inquire about immigration status only after a lawful stop, detention or arrest based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

""We're not going to be doing immigration sweeps. Our focus is if we contact someone criminally, then we may as a secondary investigation conduct an immigration investigation,"" said Kozak.

This allows deputies to detain the individual for removal proceedings.

Part of the policy is involving a direct ICE supervisor.

""They will validate everything that we're doing and actually give us the green light to proceed with the detention or not,"" said Kozak.

This is all authorized and funded under Title 8, Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an agreement that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wyoming has been very outspoken about.

The ACLU said these agreements have a history of eroding public safety, imposing heavy financial burdens on localities and leading to civil rights violations.

""Laramie County deputies belong in the neighborhoods of our communities providing crime prevention services to build trust and maintain order – not to be pulled out of neighborhoods to handle a federal responsibility.""

The ACLU continued, ""Deputizing so many local law enforcement officers to act as immigration agents diverts resources away from activities and investigations that actually keep our neighborhoods safe. By participating in 287(g) agreements, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office is actually eroding trust in local law enforcement and deterring immigrant families from coming forward when they are the victims of crime or even asking for basic assistance.""

Sheriff Kozak said training for the authorized deputies included classes on cultural diversity, profiling, naturalization process, document identification, visas and constitutional standards.

The sheriff said his priority is to deploy deputies to stop human and drug trafficking on Interstates 25 and 80.

In the last month, more than 1,000 people have been arrested in and around Chicago since the Trump administration ramped up immigration raids in the city.

And, today, during a Cabinet meeting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration's moves and said they will ramp up the federal presence.

KRISTI NOEM, U.S.

DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We have cities where this tremendous crime.

And Chicago is one of them.

And if the governor can't straighten it out, we will straighten it out.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The administration says the Guard is needed to protect ICE agents from protests, which have erupted at an ICE facility outside the city.

Protesters have blocked government vehicles at the entrance to the site and agents have thrown demonstrators to the ground, deployed tear gas and fire pepper balls.

In one instance last month, a DHS agent appears to shoot a protesting Presbyterian minister in the head with a pepper ball.

In response, DHS said force was necessary because protesters were impeding operations and they'd been ordered to leave the federal property.

And further away from that facility, there have been two separate incidents in the last month underscoring the rising tensions between the community and federal officials.

In one instance, an ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old father of two during a traffic stop.

DHS alleges Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged the agent with his car.

Agents were not wearing body cameras.

And one eyewitness said Gonzalez was driving away, trying to escape.

And then, over the weekend, protests broke out when a federal agent shot a woman who allegedly rammed his vehicle.

Yesterday, hundreds marched peacefully through downtown Chicago in opposition to the immigration crackdown and the National Guard's presence.

The city and the state are both suing the Trump administration over the move.

Therefore, in the context of the World Day of Migrants and Refugees and the Jubilee of Migrants, we wish to emphasize a central truth of our Christian faith: that every human person is created in the image and likeness of God and thus possesses an inherent dignity that is inviolable.

Many individuals and families have come to America fleeing violence, poverty, and extraordinary hardship. These are not mere statistics, but brothers and sisters in the human family, members who belong to and contribute to our local communities, parishes, and our nation.

As shepherds of the Church in Missouri, we support secure borders that ensure the safety and welfare of our nation. We also stand in solidarity with immigrants and their families, especially those who have already suffered so much in search of stability, peace, and safety.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (n. 2241) teaches that a society oriented to the common good must address the issue of immigration in a manner that is both just and merciful. Civil authorities are duty-bound to protect citizens and ensure the rule of law, especially against evildoers. Yet it is equally just, and profoundly Christian, to distinguish between violent criminals and those who are fleeing persecution or crushing poverty to seek a better life. As Pope St. John Paul II wisely stated, “His irregular legal status cannot allow the migrant to lose his dignity, since he is endowed with inalienable rights, which can neither be violated nor ignored.” (Message for World Migration Day, 1996)

We urge our elected officials at every level to reflect this truth in policy by pursuing comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders while offering a just and merciful pathway for those who are already part of our communities. It is time to move beyond temporary fixes to a solution that honors the dignity of all and provides security and protects the sovereignty of our nation. Both are necessary for a prosperous future.

While this challenge is complex, we cannot remain indifferent. Our Lord reminds us, “Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me” (Matthew 25:40). Let us pray fervently for our nation’s leaders, that they may govern with wisdom and compassion, and for those who flee persecution and hardship in search of safety. Let us educate ourselves on what the Church teaches about migration and the dignity of the human person. And let us extend the hand of charity to migrants and refugees in our neighborhoods, schools, and parishes.

May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Americas, intercede for us.

Shapiro in Philadelphia on Oct. 9, 2025.

Pennsylvania has joined several states taking legal action against President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced on Wednesday night.

“Deploying the National Guard to patrol American cities over the wishes of their governors is incredibly dangerous and an unprecedented infringement on states’ rights,” Shapiro wrote on social media. “Pennsylvania just took legal action to support our fellow states and put an end to the dangerous overreach of power we are seeing with Donald Trump’s Guard deployments.”

Over the summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. That action was ruled by a federal judge in California in September to be a violation of federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.

Trump has deployed troops to three cities; Could Philadelphia be on his list?

Since then, Trump has also sent National Guard troops to Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, in what he says is an effort to combat crime. However, elected officials in Illinois and Oregon have argued against this move and have filed legal challenges over it. The Republican governor of Tennessee has welcomed the deployment.

Shapiro joins a coalition of 24 attorney generals and governors in an amicus brief supporting Oregon’s court challenge to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in their state.

“President Trump’s deployment of Oregon’s National Guard, and attempted deployment of out-of-state Guard forces in Oregon, without the consent of Oregon’s Governor and in violation of the statute on which the President relies, is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the officials wrote in the amicus brief. “It is inconsistent with one of our Nation’s founding principles that freedom depends on the subordination of the military to civilian authority.”

“It violates core constitutional principles of federalism, and it infringes on the sovereignty and police powers reserved to the States,” they add. “By calling forth troops when there is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law enforcement are fully able to execute the law, the President flouts the vision of our Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the constitutional rights of all Americans at risk.”

Shapiro has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s threats to send the National Guard to these cities for months, saying that his administration is prepared to act if Trump decides to deploy troops in the Keystone State.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Shapiro said his office could take “many additional actions” over this matter in the future.

“This is just one piece,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star.

The brief includes Shapiro’s name, but not state Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican.

Shapiro told the Capital-Star that he has a “very constructive” working relationship with Sunday.

“I have authority as governor to file an amicus brief like that, to file lawsuits,” Shapiro said. “As does he under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act.”

Sunday’s office declined to comment on the legal action taken by Shapiro.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner held a series of town halls last month to provide advice for what citizens should do if the National Guard was deployed to Pennsylvania’s biggest city, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.

Shapiro, noting his current role as commander in chief of the Pennsylvania National Guard and former state Attorney General, referenced his administration funding 1,500 more police officers as a reason that gun deaths have decreased in the state since he was sworn in to office.

“If Donald Trump is actually serious about crime, he should support states and local governments who know their communities best,” Shapiro wrote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/losangelesnationalguard-2048x1355.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 09:56:38.560026

However, national security concerns relating to large numbers of Chinese nationals who are here on student and other visas persist.","A key component of FAIR’s mission has always been to educate the public about the impact of our immigration policies on the vital interests of the American people. The merger of the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) into FAIR earlier this summer promised to enhance this mission by bringing together IRLI’s investigative portfolio with FAIR’s well-established research capabilities. This synergy led to FAIR’s publication of two new reports in early September that expose how America’s adversaries have been exploiting U.S. immigration policies to undermine our interests and national cohesion.

How China Weaponized America’s Immigration Chaos

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made their objective very clear: they plan to supplant the United States as the world’s dominant military and economic superpower. It is a goal they have been pursuing relentlessly for more than 40 years. And, during the past four years, the Biden administration’s open-borders policies provided them with a new opportunity to advance their mission.

A comprehensive analysis conducted by FAIR’s Research department finds that China took full advantage of the Biden administration’s open-borders policies. The magnitude of illegal immigration from China grew exponentially during that period and can be summed up with two numbers: 29,136 and 182,628.

29,136 is the cumulative number of illegal aliens from mainland China who were encountered entering the U.S. illegally during the eleven-year period prior to former President Biden taking office.

182,628 is the cumulative number of illegal aliens from mainland China who were encountered entering the U.S. illegally during the four years of the Biden administration.

It is important to note that the 182,628 figure only reflects the number of Chinese illegal aliens who were encountered by U.S. immigration authorities. Under the Biden administration, some 2 million known “gotaways” crossed our borders illegally and disappeared into the country. It is reasonable to assume that, at least some of those 2 million people were nationals of the People’s Republic of China.

Like most of the illegal aliens who arrived here during the Biden administration, the vast majority of Chinese nationals were economic migrants. China’s economy suffered greatly from the COVID pandemic. Poor economic conditions in one’s homeland, however, are never grounds for seeking asylum. Nevertheless, large numbers of Chinese nationals submitted frivolous asylum claims, effectively short-circuiting their removal – at least temporarily. By the end of 2023, 112,495 Chinese citizens had pending asylum claims. Should any of these asylum claims be denied, the likelihood that the applicants will be successfully removed from the United States is low. China heads the list of recalcitrant countries (those nations who will not accept their own nationals for repatriation after they are deported from the United States). Accordingly, thousands of Chinese citizens with final orders of deportation are essentially free to roam the U.S. until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement effectuates their removal to China or a third country.

What makes illegal immigration from China especially concerning is that the Chinese government is engaged in large-scale military and industrial espionage against the United States. Even beyond the borders of China, the CCP holds enormous leverage over expatriates in the form of family members who remain there. Chinese law also requires its citizens to participate in intelligence operations. FAIR’s report found that, “Up to 100 incidents have been documented of Chinese nationals accessing or attempting to access military bases and other sensitive sites,” including by those who entered illegally.

China is also an integral player in the fentanyl crisis, working closely with Mexican cartels. Many of the component chemicals for the lethal drug originate in China. The Biden administration’s open borders facilitated the entry of fentanyl to the U.S., and Chinese nationals were involved in laundering the cartels’ drug money.

President Trump has effectively curtailed unlawful crossings of the U.S. – Mexican border since taking office. However, national security concerns relating to large numbers of Chinese nationals who are here on student and other visas persist. In many cases, these students and visitors have access to highly sensitive research vital to economic and national security. Unfortunately, rather than reducing the numbers of Chinese students at American universities and instituting tighter vetting, President Trump has indicated that he supports American universities continuing to take in hundreds of thousands of Chinese students, effectively training America’s competition.

The June 2025 Anti-ICE Riots in LA Were a Coordinated Campaign Organized by Anti- Border Groups and Foreign Actors

The civil unrest that took place in Los Angeles was anything but a peaceful and spontaneous grassroots reaction to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations that took place in that city earlier this year. FAIR’s new Investigations department uncovered extensive evidence that the attacks on ICE officers and widespread destruction of property that took place in June were orchestrated by outside agitators.

The mayhem, and the refusal of local and state officials to respond meaningfully, precipitated the need for the federal government to dispatch the National Guard and active-duty Marines to the city to quell the violence. In fact, the investigative report found that it is likely that both the LAPD and the LA County Sheriff’s Department had prior knowledge of this orchestration but failed to act on it.

FAIR’s report analyzes how outside groups – including those representing foreign interests – took advantage of legitimate expressions of protest against ICE enforcement policies to foment violence and sow domestic discord in the U.S. FAIR’s investigation found that, “Command structures were evident as the riots unfolded, with agitators using megaphones and hand signals to direct crowds toward specific locations.” Additionally, there were “individuals driving trucks full of supplies and handing out face shields to rioters so they could continue their attacks against law enforcement.”

These organizers included domestic groups, such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) and the Hispanic Federation. CHIRLA has been the beneficiary of $34 million in state grants since 2023, while the Hispanic Federation has received $20 million in funding from corporate sponsors and progressive foundations.

Funding also flowed in from foreign sources, including China which has also been exploiting our open borders and access to leading American universities. It appears that money from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), channeled through American expatriates Neville Roy Singham and his wife Jodie Evans (who managed Jerry Brown’s 1992 presidential campaign), was directed to the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL). PSL was one of the groups that played a role in inciting the unrest that unfolded. The Mexican government also provided support for detained Mexican nationals, and openly condemned ICE’s enforcement actions in the second largest city in the U.S.

The findings of FAIR’s investigation reveal striking similarities to other violent protests that have taken place across U.S. cities and college campuses over the past several years.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/NL2510_Article-2.jpg.webp?itok=Br4YgEIB,N,,2025-10-10 12:59:18.808047

The lawmakers said agency officials failed to adequately answer their questions during the visit, prompting a formal inquiry to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.

“We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility,” the lawmakers wrote in a shared letter to Erik Johnson, the deputy field office director of enforcement and removal operations at ICE’s Seattle field office. “We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.”

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear.","Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US’s major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns.

Personnel data obtained by Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, and shared with the Guardian, suggests the Trump administration has moved 45% of FBI agents in the country’s 25 largest field offices to support the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration crackdown. Across all of the FBI’s offices, 23% of the roughly 13,000 total agents at the bureau are now working on immigration, according to Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.

Warner’s office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau’s mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities.

The data, first reported by the Washington Post, suggests the FBI is dramatically shifting its objectives in an effort to back Trump’s increasingly aggressive immigration raids, with the administration targeting 3,000 daily arrests and seeking to expand its detention capacity to detain more than 100,000 immigrants.

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner. The senator’s office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents’ total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.

“When you pull a quarter of the FBI’s top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement.

The transformation of the FBI has raised alarms about the potential consequences for communities targeted by immigration raids and the impact on the work the bureau is abandoning, experts said.

Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI’s mandate. Some agents might be eager to support the president’s immigration agenda while others likely oppose the redirection, he said: “Part of the reason FBI leadership would be doing this at such scale is to separate those two – to identify who are the loyalists and who are potential impediments to the administration’s goals.”

The move is in line with FBI director Kash Patel’s efforts to purge the bureau of agents seen as disloyal to Trump, German said, noting reports of the termination of personnel involved in the January 6 investigation.

FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said.

There has been extensive documentation of the violent and indiscriminate nature of the Ice raids, which have often been carried out by masked men and have at times led to the detention of US citizens, and adding FBI personnel to the mix could exacerbate the chaos and potential for abuses, the former agent said.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear. Spokespeople for DHS, Ice, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau’s intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don’t have capacity to tackle: “That’s where the real harm will come.”

Current and former FBI agents told the Washington Post there were growing concerns about low morale within the agency and that agents were stretched thin, which could hamper national security investigations and complex cases.

Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent and professor of practice in the University of New Haven’s criminal justice department, said the shift in priorities resembled the post-9/11 reorganization at the FBI, when counterterrorism became the central focus.

“The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.”

Dear Mr. Johnson:

Thank you for coordinating the visit to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on September 25, 2025. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative, and today we write to follow up on several items that we discussed during the visit. We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility.

We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility. There are multiple instances of agents breaking car windows and ripping people from their vehicles, holding knives to people’s necks, and shoving bystanders to the ground. In addition to this unnecessary violence and use of force, ICE agents hide their identities by wearing masks and do not have visible identification or badge numbers. This poses a serious safety concern and makes the entire community less safe. We also heard about changes being made to expeditiously hire new ICE agents at the facility, including compressing the training. In addition to unnecessary aggression perpetuated by ICE agents, we are concerned about how new agents with less training might further escalate tensions in the community.

Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What is the current process to initiate an initial review of a bond request at Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)? Who at ERO is responsible for initial reviews of requests for bond?

What criteria is used to determine which requests for bond will be sent forward or denied? Please provide any directives that outline these criteria.

Of the total number of detained noncitizens who have come through the facility since January 2025, how many bond requests have been approved and how many have been denied?

We have seen reports that individuals with legal status have been detained. What criteria have agents been given to determine who to detain?

There are several instances of immigrants with documented medical and health concerns or who were recovering from surgery who were summarily deported. What standards are used to determine medical clearance for deportation? Please provide a copy of those standards.

Masked ICE agents are unidentifiable in our communities and hide their identities. This raises significant safety concerns. How are you holding your staff accountable for negligence and unnecessary violence if ICE agents do not have identification or badge numbers visible?

We understand that hiring for the community relations position at the Macadam facility has been challenging. What plans are in place to hire a Community Relations staff for the Macadam facility?

There are multiple reports of ICE staff harassing volunteers outside of the facility. What training are staff receiving on carrying out community enforcement? What plans are in place to guarantee that newly hired staff are adequately trained on a condensed timeline?

How are you complying with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and working to make sure people with mobility issues are able to access the facility for appointments?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

Dear Secretary Noem:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations by Federal Protective Service (FPS) at the facility.

More than a dozen advocates outside the facility have reported unprovoked attacks by Homeland Security police and FPS officers, leaving people with large bruises, chemical burns, and lingering pain. The Portland Police Bureau reported that federal police shoved, hit, and used chemical spray on people outside the facility when, according to multiple witnesses, there was no physical threat to officers. Additionally, a Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief said in a court filing that federal police are instigating some of the clashes. These allegations are unacceptable. It is the responsibility of FPS to protect federal persons and property.[1] In June, the President issued a Presidential Memoranda calling at least 2,000 members of the National Guard into Federal service under the false premise that they are needed to “temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel performing Federal functions.”[2]

Over the weekend, federal law enforcement escalated their tactics against demonstrators outside of Macadam facility, including firing tear gas and smoke canisters, pepper spraying peaceful protestors in the face, and deploying pepper bullets. These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable.

We demand additional clarity about the response from your agents at the ICE Macadam facility:

What type of munitions are used against people collected outside of the Macadam facility? Please provide a detailed description.

What criteria is used to determine whether or not to use munitions against people outside the facility? How do you decide what tools to use at different times of day? Who makes those determinations?

There have been several reports of Federal Protective Services Agents instigating violent altercations with peaceful protesters outside the Macadam facility. How does FPS determine when to engage with protestors? What criteria is used to make these determinations? Are there protocols in place to hold FPS accountable when they use unnecessary force?

Neighbors and businesses near the Macadam facility have reported lingering substances in the air causing health concerns. How are you working with neighbors and businesses around the facility to reduce negative consequences of these substances?

Thank you for your attention to this letter. We look forward to hearing from you by October 22, 2025.

Dear Attorney General Bondi:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about due process violations by ICE staff and attorneys.

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to due process, regardless of immigration status, and the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the right to counsel in any removal proceedings.[3] Due process is a cornerstone of American democracy that is currently being eroded. When a person’s rights are violated, the result can be wrongful deportations.

Community organizations are reporting that some immigrants are being denied access to counsel at the Macadam facility. During our meeting at the ICE facility, we repeatedly asked for clarification about why individuals in detention have been denied access to counsel and were not provided with an adequate response. Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What pre-representation support is allowed at the Macadam facility?

Do you allow attorneys to enter the Macadam facility to conduct pre-representational interviews?

Do you ever deny attorneys access to the facility to conduct pre-representational interviews? If so, under what circumstances and what authority?

The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to due process and the law allows the right to an attorney. On what grounds are you denying counsel to individuals in custody?

What is the protocol staff follow when someone in ICE custody at the Macadam facility requests a lawyer?

What options are available for individuals seeking virtual immigration hearings? Are these ever granted? If not, on what grounds are those requests denied?

How long do removal proceeding hearings typically last?

Which personnel are allowed into immigration hearings (ICE staff, DOJ staff, attorneys, etc.)?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

,Litigation,2025-10-09 22:21:25+00:00,Chicago Sun-Times,Judge grants a partial temporary restraining order on National Guard deployment in Illinois,"Jon Seidel, Tina Sfondeles",,,,,https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/10/09/national-guard-lawsuit-judge-ruling-illinois-trump,"A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.
Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov.
No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.” Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.
“Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”","A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.

After hearing arguments from lawyers representing the state and the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she will grant “in part” a state request for a temporary restraining order against troop deployment.

Perry said her decision comes down to a “credibility determination.”

“I simply cannot credit [the Trump administration’s] declarations to the extent they contradict state and local law enforcement,” Perry said. “[The Department of Homeland Security’s] perception of events [is] simply unreliable.”

Perry pointed to other federal prosecutions or lawsuits in Chicago and said “in the last 48 hours, in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

The Trump administration mobilized hundreds of National Guard members to protect federal agents and property over objections from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who sued on behalf of the state and city to block the move.

“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.

Perry is still ruling and the details of her order are not yet known.

Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections.

U.S. District Judge April Perry intends to reconvene in her courtroom at 4:30 p.m. with lawyers representing the state, which is seeking a temporary restraining order against the deployment, and Justice Department lawyers fighting that effort.

Before the court went into recess, Christopher Wells, the lead lawyer representing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Pritzker administration, summarized the state’s position that President Trump was acting maliciously with his push for National Guard troops in Illinois despite the governor’s objections.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and of a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” Wells said.

The Justice Department lawyer representing Trump, Eric Hamilton, reiterated that Trump’s judgment in this case is “unreviewable” and argued there’s “no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the guard protecting federal property and personnel in a state of 13 million people.”

It’s unclear whether Perry will issue a decision from the bench later this afternoon.

U.S. District Judge April Perry asked Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton whether the president’s perceived inability to execute the law – a justification needed for Trump to mobilize the National Guard under federal law – was something “caused by the federal agents.”

Hamilton responded, “No, your honor.”

The judge then observed that the Broadview immigration enforcement processing facility had been the site of “nothing but peaceful prayer vigils” for 19 years. “And then,” Perry said, “CBP shows up and then suddenly things take a turn for the worse.”

Perry asked Hamilton whether the feds’ provoking protesters to the point federal law is unenforceable is something to be weighed under the National Guard mobilization law.

“No,” Hamilton said. “If that were true, the fact still remains that we are seeing sustained violence against federal personnel and property in Illinois.”

Singling out examples of violence the feds provided – claims of “slashed tires” and “keyed cars” – the judge said, “Some of this frankly sounds like a Carrie Underwood song.”

Hamilton shot back: “This is no Carrie Underwood song.”

He pointed to more serious incidents, including the claim of a bomb.

Perry asked what was in that alleged device, and Hamilton responded, “I don’t know.”

U.S. District Judge April Perry turned her questioning of a Justice Department lawyer toward statements President Trump has made about deploying National Guard troops to Illinois and asked whether he is relying on “completely invalid evidence.”

Perry said there appeared to be a “very large disconnect” between what Trump said on social media and in press conferences and what conditions are actually like on the ground in Illinois.

The judge zeroed in on the case of Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, protesters at the Broadview ICE facility who were arrested while each was legally carrying a gun. In an unusual move, a federal grand jury refused to indict the couple.

The couple’s arrest was used, in part, as a justification by the Trump administration for National Guard units to help protect federal agents on the ground in the Chicago area.

But Perry noted how carrying a gun is a constitutionally protected right and that a grand jury didn’t support criminal charges against the couple.

“This indicates to me a certain lack of credibility,” Perry told the Justice Department lawyer.

With opening arguments over, U.S. District Judge April Perry pressed the Justice Department lawyer on whether the National Guard deployment that appears now to exceed 500 troops could increase and exactly what their duties would be.

Eric Hamilton, the lawyer representing the federal government, called plans for headcount and the troops’ use a “dynamic situation that could change.”

Hamilton went on to say that troops expected to be assigned at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse would be there at the request of the Federal Protective Services, a contention the judge said is “untrue. No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.”

Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.

He said they would “provide protection” but in a way that’s “distinct from law enforcement.” They would not be authorized to make arrests, he said.

Perry pressed Hamilton on whether troops would be “solving crime in Chicago,” and he answered, “Certainly, to an extent.”

The lead federal government lawyer justified President Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to Illinois because Chicago is experiencing what he called a “brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement.”

Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton told Judge April Perry that those objecting to the actions of federal immigration enforcement agents are “not protesters. They are the violent resistance to duly enacted immigration laws.”

Hamilton pointed to different examples of alleged violence against federal agents and said that was the basis for the mobilization of Guard units. Federal law allows that, he said, if there is “either a rebellion or a danger of a rebellion.”

Hamilton called the president’s decision to send in troops “unreviewable” and denied Illinois’ claim that the deployment is in retaliation to the sanctuary status of Illinois and Chicago.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” he said.

With Attorney General Kwame Raoul sitting in the front row, a lawyer representing the state of Illinois argued that the Trump administration’s mobilization of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections upsets the “careful balance of our constitutional system” and must be stopped.

Christopher Wells opened his arguments for a temporary restraining order against Trump with a look back to the country’s founders.

“Rebellion. Invasion. Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” Wells told U.S. District Judge April Perry. “The people who wrote our Constitution understood the weight of these words. The people who wrote our constitution had lived these words.”

The federal immigration enforcement action known as Operation Midway Blitz has boasted of 1,000 arrests, but Wells said there is no justification to warrant Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to help with that task.

“Where exactly is the problem?” he asked. “Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/12efe0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5913x3375+0+284/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6f%2Fd5%2F3cc1192d4e8385186bcda69721aa%2Ftexastroops-101025-06.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:13.337621

CT lawmakers are considering it - Hartford Courant,Livi Stanford,,,,,https://www.courant.com/2025/10/09/more-legal-protections-for-immigrants-ct-lawmakers-are-considering-it/,"With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.
Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.
The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.
“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said.
“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said.","With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.

State Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said there are significant conversations among his colleagues and the executive branch about potential legislation during a special session but there are key differences internally among parties to the discussion.

He said nothing has been finalized.

“I think we should do everything we legally can to protect these people,” Winfield said. “Others are concerned about what those decisions mean for the federal government interfacing with the state,” the senator said. “I think that is where the differences come in. We are trying to negotiate between those different sets of thoughts and concerns and we just have not come to a place where we have done that.”

In the state there have been increased arrests and detentions of immigrants by ICE agents wearing masks showing up at court, at the offices where people go to make child support payments and at people’s workplaces and their homes, immigration advocates said.

Immigration advocates and faith leaders called on legislators Monday to pass legislation during the special session to protect immigrants.

“It is extremely important to protect the courthouses and make sure that people are not in danger of being picked up by ICE when they are reporting for other issues,” Constanza Segovia, cofounder of the Hartford Deportation Defense and organizing director for Connecticut For All Coalition said. “It ends up impacting the justice system as a whole if people don’t feel safe going to court for a speeding ticket or to report domestic violence. It is a matter of public safety to access the courts.”

Protecting personal data of immigrants and citizens is also crucial, Segovia added, explaining that people should feel safe paying taxes in the state and not fear that they will be picked up as a result.

Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.

On Sept. 19, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Supreme Court Justice Raheem Mullins issued a new policy that states that ICE cannot make arrests without a warrant inside the state courthouses. Further, the policy states that immigration agents cannot wear masks.

Ninety-two organizations committed to immigrant rights, civil rights, human rights, gender rights, worker rights and racial justice, sent a letter to the lawmakers outlining specific priorities for immigration protections including protecting immigrants at courthouses; preserving Husky Medicaid for undocumented children and pregnant individuals; protecting the personal information of the immigrant community and all Connecticut residents; and making communities safer by prohibiting the use of state and local resources to assist in immigration enforcement, according to the letter.

Local immigration attorneys said that ICE is targeting those with deportation orders and those enrolled in former President Joe Biden’s parole program. But some are just being profiled as ICE agents pass by.

This past June Lamont signed legislation strengthening the controversial Connecticut Trust Act, the current law maintaining the independence of state and municipal police.

The Trust Act blocks local police from making an arrest that is based only on a request by federal agents in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said with over a $100 billion of federal funding allocated for ICE starting this fiscal year, the state has to respond in some way.

“I want to make sure the constitutional rights of everyone in Connecticut including U.S. citizens are protected,” he said. “The federal government has a responsibility to enforce immigration laws. I respect that. I am concerned about overreach and infringement of constitutional rights.”

He added that the legislature should pass the state civil rights law and ensure protections are in place to tighten rules upon state data.

The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.

“The state has the ability to protect federal constitutional rights at the state level and to say that we are going to ensure that they are not violated,” Lesser said.

“We need to tighten up the rules on data sharing,” he said.

State Sen. Saud Anwar, co-chair of the state’s Public Health Committee, also called for legislation to protect immigrants.

“We need a comprehensive strategy going forward because the federal government is on a different trajectory,” he said. “We must make this a priority. No immigrant in the community should live in fear of masked individuals kidnapping them.”

Senate Republican leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said he has hesitation anytime any advocate wants to expand the Trust Act because in his view all it does is expand protections to criminals.

“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said. “I am all for having a discussion for those who may be here illegally but otherwise abiding by the law and positively contributing to society. I am not willing to have any discussion about helping individuals that are being convicted of violent, heinous crimes and protecting those from deportation.”

Harding added that “we go down a very slippery slope when we start dictating to federal authorities what they can and cannot do in the state of Connecticut.”

Winfield said it is a red herring for Republicans to talk about the issue of crime related to the Trust Act.

“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said. “The only thing that has happened with the Trust Act is we’ve said, ‘let’s put more crimes so more crimes are covered as exceptions.’

“The stuff we are talking about is what happens in our courts. The stuff we are talking about is whether ICE can run throughout the state of Connecticut unidentified. The stuff we are talking about is whether they follow the laws of the state. It is a distraction. They know better,” Winfield said.

The law strengthening the Trust Act also expands situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers and not be subject to litigation, according to the Connecticut Mirror. The Mirror reported the bill added 13 crimes including sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation and others for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request.

Winfield said at the core what we “are trying to do is offer people protections that we can and from my perspective you can call it the expansion of the Trust Act, you can call it something new — I don’t care what you call it. What I care about at the end of the day is what is the state of Connecticut’s policy toward immigrants who largely have been good neighbors to us.”

Martin Berchie, who had been detained by ICE in Sherburne County Jail since August, alleges that ICE forged his name on the travel document used to deport him to Ghana on Tuesday.

Travel documents are official paperwork needed that authorize the removal of a non-U.S. citizen to another country.

Berchie, 31, made the allegation in a legal filing Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court. The legal filing asks for an evidentiary hearing to present the allegations to a judge.

“The deportation was performed in an illegal manner through the use of forged documents,” Berchie’s attorney, Nico Ratkowski, wrote in the Wednesday legal filing.

Sahan Journal reached out to ICE for comment but did not receive a response.

Berchie alleges that ICE agents put his name on a travel document that was already used for a different ICE detainee who had already been deported. They then “abandoned” Berchie in pre-customs in Ghana “instead of presenting him to Ghana immigration authorities.”

“Ghana rejected [Berchie] and went to look for the immigration officers that brought him, but was unable to locate those officers,” Berchie’s legal filing reads.

Ghanaian immigration authorities then “had no other choice” but to process Berchie into Ghana, according to the legal filing.

“This is akin to pushing Berchie out of a helicopter with a parachute because a travel document could not be produced,” Ratkowski wrote in the legal filing. “If [Berchie]’s claims are true, [ICE]’s actions were extraordinarily illegal and are a seminal and extremely concerning example of bad faith by the agency.”

In August shortly after his arrest, Ratkowski filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in court asking ICE to release Berchie because previous attempts to deport him had been unsuccessful. Habeas corpus lawsuits are requests to the court to be released from jail while an immigration case is pending.

Berchie came to the United States from Ghana in 2018 on an F1 visa to attend college. His visa expired the following year, according to a legal filing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Trevor Brown opposing his habeas motion.

In 2020, he was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct after a woman accused him of sexual assault. Berchie ultimately pleaded guilty in September 2021 to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Court documents say he was credited for time already served at the time of his sentencing.

ICE detained him in November 2020, and held Berchie in the Freeborn County Jail. In March 2021, an immigration judge ordered Berchie to be removed from the country and deported to Ghana. But ICE had trouble deporting Berchie and released him from jail in February 2022 because “Ghana was not timely issuing a travel document at that point,” according to the legal filing by Brown.

ICE instead placed him on an order of supervision, which required him to check in with the agency on a monthly basis.

Berchie complied with the supervision order through August of this year, according to his habeas lawsuit. In fact, ICE detained Berchie during a check-in required under the supervision order.

“[Berchie] is now detained because there is a significant likelihood of his removal to Ghana in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Brown wrote that Ghana had, so far this year, issued 70 travel documents to ICE detainees and that ICE officials applied for a travel document for Berchie on Aug. 12.

“Berchie will be removed from the United States in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Ratkowski disputed this argument in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit, arguing that the difficulty of obtaining a travel document from Ghana had not changed since 2022.

“The government is not in possession of any credible or persuasive documents or evidence that Berchie’s removal is likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.

He characterized Berchie’s detention as “punitive” and serving “no legitimate purpose.”

“The redetention of Berchie is designed to send a message to other individuals with final orders of removal that they need to leave the United States or they will be jailed indefinitely and without any process,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9314.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:31.460929

“We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.” The delegation cited reports of ICE agents breaking car windows, forcibly removing people from vehicles and concealing their identities with masks.
In a separate letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers accused the Federal Protective Service of using unnecessary force against demonstrators and advocates outside the Portland facility.
“These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable,” the lawmakers wrote, demanding details on when and how agents are authorized to use such munitions.

Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., led Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Rep. Maxine Dexter in sending letters this week to top federal officials following a Sept. 25 visit to the ICE facility on Southwest Macadam Avenue, which has been the site of frequent clashes between protestors and federal officers. The lawmakers said agency officials failed to adequately answer their questions during the visit, prompting a formal inquiry to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.

“We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility,” the lawmakers wrote in a shared letter to Erik Johnson, the deputy field office director of enforcement and removal operations at ICE’s Seattle field office. “We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.”

The delegation cited reports of ICE agents breaking car windows, forcibly removing people from vehicles and concealing their identities with masks. They also raised concerns about shortened training for new hires and possible violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In a separate letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers accused the Federal Protective Service of using unnecessary force against demonstrators and advocates outside the Portland facility. The letter described accounts of unprovoked shoving, pepper-spraying and firing tear gas and pepper bullets into crowds, causing health concerns for nearby residents and businesses.

“These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable,” the lawmakers wrote, demanding details on when and how agents are authorized to use such munitions.

A third letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi raised questions about due process and access to attorneys for immigrants detained at the facility. The lawmakers said some detainees have been denied legal counsel, potentially leading to wrongful deportations.

“We repeatedly asked for clarification about why individuals in detention have been denied access to counsel and were not provided with an adequate response,” the lawmakers wrote.

He also blames local liberal leaders for goading agitators into the violence seen over the weekend.

Raymond Lopez — alderman for Chicago’s 15th Ward — fears rhetoric from leaders like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson is pushing the city and the country to a dangerous place that there may be no coming back from.

“The politics of this city and of hyper progressive liberalism is bringing us closer to the brink with an escalation that I don’t think any of us truly wants to see,” Lopez told The Post.

“The governor, the mayor, with a wink and a nod, told everyone to protest peacefully. And we’ve seen the exact opposite unfold,” he added.

“They’re continuing to play a game of chicken with other people’s lives.”

Lopez is one of Chicago’s only Democratic leaders to openly support President Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to fight local crime since it was first proposed over the summer.

He said his position hasn’t changed since the White House confirmed over the weekend that 300 troops would be dispatched to protect ICE agents conducting immigration-enforcement raids in the city.

Those ICE operations were targeted by violent harassment, with some protesters even following federal agents and boxing them in on Saturday, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Chicago police were reportedly ordered not to answer federal agents calls for back-up.

The Chicago Police Department has since disputed those reports.

Lopez feels that such behavior — encouraged “directly or indirectly” by local leadership — made Trump’s decision to send in federal troops “a fore-drawn conclusion.”

“If we’re not going to allow law enforcement to protect [ICE] and keep the peace with our residents, then the president of the United States most definitely is going to take that action,” he said. “We cannot have our our citizenry thinking that they can take up arms against the federal government and suffer no consequences.”

And none of the current chaos had to happen if leaders simply followed a “common sense” approach to apprehending Chicago’s worst criminal element by just coordinating with the federal government to “surgically” remove them months ago, Lopez said.

“Instead, what we got were politicians — from the governor to the mayor on down — challenging the Trump administration to go into our communities and find those targets themselves,” he said. “They almost joked about it, as if they as if that would never have been a possibility or a reality. And yet here we are today.”

“We are making the case as to why we need the National Guard now more than ever, with people choosing to try to attack federal law enforcement agents here in the city of Chicago,” Lopez added.

Tensions have continued to boil as National Guard troops began arriving in the Chicago area Tuesday — with Trump raging on Truth Social that Pritzker and Johnson both should be “in jail,” while the governor and mayor returned fire by calling the president a “wannabe dictator.”

Alderman Lopez maintains that both sides are so busy playing politics they’ve forgotten about the Chicagoans they claim to be protecting — and that the longer they squabble, the greater the stakes become.

“We have nearly three and a half years left with Donald Trump. We better figure it out because we cannot exist in this fashion,” he said, adding that federal agents are “going to do what they’re trained to do, which is to de-escalate by any means necessary in order to protect life and property.”

“This is what you get when you are acting in this manner with people who are trained in a very different level,” he added.

“I don’t think they’re prepared for what’s going to happen next.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/democratic-alderman-raymond-lopez-chicago-113016739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-10-09 18:57:17.094017

“Under the Florida law, my understanding is that entry is a continuous offense and you can be prosecuted anywhere you’re found,” Jordan, a Barack Obama appointee, said.
We otherwise would not be engaged in that practice, because we don’t actually exercise any control under Florida law over law enforcement.” Lagoa agreed.","ATLANTA (CN) — A coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations asked an 11th Circuit panel Thursday to keep a new Florida law targeting people in the U.S. illegally and enter the Sunshine State blocked

“The dominant federal interest here is that, for 150 years, the Supreme Court has made clear that there is an exclusive federal authority over entry into the United States,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Cody Wolsy told the three-judge panel. “This is a scheme that has been addressed in a bunch of different ways, all the different values and policies and interests that the federal government might have in a particular case of a person entering without inspection. And it gives the federal government a lot of different tools. Some of them are much more punitive, like the criminal provisions that are duplicated here.”

In February, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 4-C, which created two new criminal statutes for immigrants who enter the state after “eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers” at the U.S. border. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis immediately signed the legislation.

Immigration advocates, including the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida, responded with a federal lawsuit in April claiming SB 4-C unconstitutionally encroaches on the duties of federal officials to implement immigration law. The lawsuit names Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and state attorneys across Florida.

Within days, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida issued a restraining order barring any enforcement of the law and directing Uthmeier to inform local law enforcement of her decree. After news of continuing arrests, the judge extended the restraining order.

Uthmeier previously asked the 11th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the injunction so arrests could continue while the litigation proceeded, but both courts declined.

During Thursday’s hearing, Wolsy of the ACLU reiterated that the federal government’s control over immigration preempts laws like SB 4-C.

“Congress in this very unique federal realm has given the president a bunch of tools and then left them at the president’s discretion,” he said. “The state can’t come in and say, ‘Well, we’re now going to take that discretion for ourselves and make the decisions for ourselves.’”

Wolsy said the law picks “winners and losers among immigrants and immigrant communities,” pointing to statutes allowing Cuban refugees, asylum seekers and victims of human trafficking to stay in the country, at least temporarily, after entering illegally.

Wolsy also argued that SB 4-C in some cases is more punitive than federal law, including withholding bail and more lengthy mandatory sentences.

“It’s another example of the state here making its own immigration policy,” he said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa pushed back slightly about preemption between federal and state policies by bringing up marijuana.

“So let me ask you a question about, let’s say marijuana, because that’s sort of a drug choice where the states are allowing legalization of marijuana and the federal government still has that as an illegal substance, but it’s choosing not to, in most cases now, prosecute for marijuana possession,” said Lagoa, a Donald Trump appointee. “I mean, it sort of goes to the issue of the federal government is choosing not to prosecute for illegal entry, but the state of Florida decides, well, we’re going to prosecute for illegal entry of someone who’s illegally in the country, but also in Florida.”

Wolsy said the two can’t be compared.

“I think that this statutory scheme is very different from just saying possession of marijuana,” Wolsy said. “Here we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with U.S. citizens. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government.”

Jeffrey DeSousa, the attorney representing Uthmeier and state prosecutors, argued SB 4-C is not preempted by federal law.

“It’s very particular,” he told the judges. “It says that if the federal government has granted lawful presence or discretionary relief, either temporarily or permanently, that is enough to absolve a person of liability under our statute.”

Lagoa interrupted.

“So you could be picked up,"" Lagoa said. “And then the way I read the statute, I think it’s a mandatory hold. So it’s sort of like a stand your ground immunity argument. You have to then move to dismiss the information and assert a defense.”

“I think that could happen,” DeSousa explained. “That would be one route. I mean, again, we’re in the pre-enforcement posture.”

Lagoa expressed skepticism. “It seems like a strange way to handle it,” she said. “It causes me some concern.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan took issue with how SB 4-C would be prosecuted.

“Under the Florida law, my understanding is that entry is a continuous offense and you can be prosecuted anywhere you’re found,” Jordan, a Barack Obama appointee, said. “It doesn’t say, neither provision says where you can be prosecuted, right?

“That’s correct,” DeSousa responded. “I want to emphasize that because this is a pre-enforcement challenge, we don’t yet have a great sense of how Florida state courts are going to interpret the term ‘entry’ here.”

DeSousa also took issue with the overly broad nature of the injunction that requires the attorney general to monitor arrests made by state law enforcement agencies to ensure they are complying with the restraining order. DeSousa said those agencies are not part of the litigation and thus “we have monitoring and oversight obligations that we should not have.”

“So that’s a diversion of our resources as an agency, where our lawyers spend time having to consult with those non-party law enforcement officers to ensure their compliance,” DeSousa said. “The situation only exists because of the overbroad nature of the injunction. We otherwise would not be engaged in that practice, because we don’t actually exercise any control under Florida law over law enforcement.”

Lagoa agreed.

“I’m speaking for myself only, I think the district court erred,” she said. “I don’t think that you have the ability to order someone who is not a party to you, where the person you’re ordering someone who does not have control over that individual to have them do something. I mean, I don’t have to affirm legal error.”

Wolsy of the ACLU said the injunction only required the attorney general to give notice of the lower court’s order.

“He didn’t have to agree with it,” Wolsy said. “He didn’t have to command them to do anything.”

Uthmeier initially complied with the order, notifying state agencies of the judge’s order. But five days later, he sent a letter to police agencies across the state, telling them “there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to court documents.

The lower court then held the attorney general in contempt for defying the order.

U.S. Circuit Judge Charles Wilson jumped on that point.

“It’s not a situation where the attorney general just didn’t do what he was ordered to do, which was provide notice of the ruling,” Wilson, a Bill Clinton appointee, said. “He went beyond not complying and suggested, and I’m using the word kindly, suggested to law enforcement officers that there was no valid order and they could go about their business enforcing these statutes.”

“It’s not a situation where the attorney general just didn’t do what he was ordered to do, which was provide notice of the ruling,” Wilson, a Bill Clinton appointee, said. “He went beyond not complying and suggested, and I’m using the word kindly, suggested to law enforcement officers that there was no valid order and they could go about their business enforcing these statutes.”

… “If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance.","Where (1) a defendant was convicted of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and (2) his subsequent motion for a new trial was denied, the defendant’s argument that trial counsel did not advise him of the immigration consequences of a conviction is foreclosed by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), but a remand is necessary for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding his right to appeal.

“The defendant seeks a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In 1999, the defendant, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with assault 2 and battery, breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, and malicious destruction of property over $250. Of these offenses, the latter two are considered ‘crimes of moral turpitude’ under the immigration laws. Following a bench trial in District Court in 2000, the defendant was convicted of the breaking and entering charge, and the lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property under $250.

“Many years later, the defendant learned that his conviction of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony foreclosed a path to permanent residency. This path had otherwise become available when the defendant’s mother became a naturalized citizen, which occurred after his trial. In 2021 the defendant moved for a new trial, arguing (1) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of a conviction, and in particular, that a conviction after trial could foreclose a specific path to permanent residency; and (2) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of his right to appeal or file a notice of appeal.

“A District Court judge denied the motion for a new trial, as well as a motion for reconsideration. The defendant presses his arguments again on appeal. The defendant’s first argument regarding immigration consequences fails, as this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), in which the Supreme Judicial Court ruled, under similar circumstances, that the defendant in that case had not shown prejudice because he had not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he could have achieved the plea bargain he posited in his motion for a new trial. As to the failure to file a notice of appeal, we must remand the matter as to this issue to the District Court, which under the circumstances needed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding the appeal and if so, whether the defendant otherwise would have timely appealed from his convictions. …

“The sole difference between this case and Marinho is that here the defendant has identified one immigration consequence that a favorable plea allegedly could have avoided — namely, that conviction of a crime of moral turpitude rendered the defendant ineligible for a form of discretionary relief from inadmissibility known as an unlawful presence waiver, available to the children of United States citizens. …

“However, even if we assume that counsel’s failure to advise of this potential consequence and to structure a possible plea bargain could constitute ineffective assistance under the circumstances, the defendant has not shown prejudice here. …

“The defendant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective by not discussing an appeal with him and by not filing a notice of appeal after the defendant’s convictions. As to this issue, we are constrained to remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing. …

“If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance. …

“So much of the order denying the motion for a new trial and order denying the motion for reconsideration that were entered as to trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness regarding the defendant’s right to an appeal and counsel’s failing to file a notice of appeal are vacated. The orders are otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Dissenting judge’s comments

Smyth, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. “I concur with the court that the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing and further findings as to whether trial counsel ever discussed the possibility of appeal with the defendant. However, I dissent from the court’s conclusion that the judge properly denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial as it pertained to trial counsel’s failure to provide adequate immigration warnings to the defendant.

“Instead, I conclude that the defendant demonstrated that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient under the protections of both the United States Constitution and Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because trial counsel failed to advise the defendant that a conviction on two of the charged offenses would adversely impact the defendant’s ability to lawfully remain in the United States. As such, the defendant satisfied the first, or performance, prong of Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).

“Concerning Saferian‘s prejudice prong, trial counsel’s failure to correctly warn the defendant of the clear immigration consequences of a conviction caused the defendant to forgo seeking an immigration-safe plea. The defendant instead proceeded to trial unaware of the immigration consequences that a conviction would have on him and his family. The defendant’s submissions established the existence of a substantial issue as to prejudice, requiring an evidentiary hearing. Specifically, the defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he would bear the burden to prove a reasonable probability that he would have successfully negotiated a plea bargain had he known of the adverse immigration consequences, and further, that the result of the plea would have been more favorable to him, as to adverse immigration consequences, than the outcome of his trial. … Thus, I would remand for that additional purpose.”

At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found.
Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.
In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back.","This week, President Donald Trump escalated his plans to send National Guard troops into blue cities — fighting in court to deploy them to Portland and sending others to Chicago ostensibly to fight crime and support federal immigration agents. He has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if courts rule against him. While images of soldiers on city streets offer a visible show of federal power, a quieter takeover is simultaneously emerging: state preemption.

On March 17, the Fort Myers City Council declined to approve an agreement that would have entered the Florida city’s police department into a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Those who voted ‘no’ could not have foreseen what came next.

The following morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rebuked the council members who opposed the agreement, posting on X: “The days of inaction are over. Govern yourselves accordingly.” Hours later, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier sent a letter to the council threatening to remove the lawmakers from office, which he shared on X, adding: “Fix this problem or face the consequences.”

This was no empty threat. In February, the Florida legislature passed a pair of immigration bills, SB 2-C and SB 4-C, that targeted “sanctuary” policies in the state. The new laws not only required municipalities to cooperate with ICE, but also gave the governor the authority to remove local officials that got in the way.

Three days after the removal threats, the council held an emergency meeting and voted unanimously in favor of the immigration agreement.

What happened in Fort Myers could happen anywhere in the U.S., experts warn. Florida’s bill represents one of hundreds of GOP-sponsored preemption bills that threaten the ability of cities and towns to govern independently. So far this year, lawmakers in 48 states have pushed more than 800 bills seeking to wrestle control from local jurisdictions — nearly double the number from the previous year — according to a recent report from the Local Solutions Support Center (LSSC), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on local democracy. This uptick reflects a troubling trend, experts say, with the Trump administration signaling to states to consolidate power to help advance its agenda.

“Trump needs the states because they have the authority to implement many of his actions, particularly around immigration,” said Katie Belanger, the lead consultant at LSSC.

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has made immigration raids in cities and towns across the country a defining priority of his administration. At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found. But preemption efforts in conservative states have not been limited to any single issue. Rather, state lawmakers this year have targeted an array of local laws concerning civil liberties and protections, including LGBTQ rights, housing, elections, workers’ rights, and education.

Take Oklahoma. In May, lawmakers passed a bill — HB 1217 — in an attempt to ban drag shows. The law carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While on the books, the state’s governor and attorney general are at odds on how to enforce the statute.

In Missouri, HB 595 effectively legalized a form of housing discrimination against low-income families. The new law overrides local regulations that prevent landlords from rejecting rental applications from people who receive federal housing subsidies.

Five states — Arkansas, Kansas, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming — passed bans on ranked-choice voting. Two states — Utah and Florida — prohibited local governments from adding fluoride to drinking water. Montana barred vaccine mandates for shots under emergency authorization.

“Some of the stuff that was shocking even five years ago is now so commonplace that we’re numb,” said Lori Riverstone, a prominent researcher of state preemption at Illinois State University.

Riverstone, who in 2017 published an article documenting conservatives’ increased use of preemption as a tool for blocking progressive policies in their states, worries that what researchers initially saw as a short-term strategy has now become the norm.

“It’s just blown up,” Riverstone said, adding, “We’re being boiled by degrees.”

Since January, hundreds of preemption bills have been introduced across the country, though only a fraction — about 11 percent — have been signed into law, according to the LSSC report. Many others that became law have faced legal challenges, such as a Tennessee law that created criminal penalties for local officials who adopt sanctuary immigration policies, and a Louisiana law that required public schools to post the Ten Commandments inside of classrooms. Similarly, a controversial section of Florida’s new immigration law, which makes it a felony for some undocumented immigrants to enter the state, is under a court injunction.

But while many bills fail to become law, and others get tied up in legal battles, experts say that may not be the point. Leslie Zellers, a public policy attorney who co-leads LSSC’s legal team, described the Republicans’ strategy as “laying the groundwork and really kind of shifting the argument to incorporate ideas like this, which were not mainstream a year ago.” Another goal, she says, is to appease President Trump.

“Some of those are definitely Republican lawmakers, maybe in a blue state or a purple state, and they are introducing the bill to show that they support the Trump agenda,” said Zellers.

Lawmakers in Florida did not shy away from their support for the president when they named an early version of their immigration bill the “TRUMP Act.” Legislative leaders in Florida reportedly consulted with the Trump administration while working on the bill. Governor DeSantis, promoting a version of the bill on X, called the legislation “necessary to ensure that Florida leads on fulfilling the Trump Administration’s mandate to enforce immigration law and deport illegal aliens.”

As the GOP’s willingness to use preemption as a political tool grows, so does the scope of the bills aiming to centralize power. Increasingly, conservatives have explored blanket preemption policies, known as “Death Star” bills, which give states the authority to impose their will on local governments with progressive policies. In 2023, Texas lawmakers passed a bill that effectively nullified local laws that conflict with state laws in a number of areas, including agriculture, finance, labor, and natural resources. The Texas “Death Star” bill survived a court challenge in July.

This year, Tennessee enacted a “Death Star” preemption, giving state lawmakers the ability to challenge local laws they object to by requesting an investigation by the state attorney general. Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.

“[State legislators] are largely using preemption to punish cities for doing things that they don’t like,” said Luke Fowler, a professor of public policy and administration in the School of Public Service at Boise State University.

When the Fort Myers City Council reconvened for its emergency meeting on March 21, city officials heard from anxious residents during a public input session. Kathy James, a Fort Myers resident and veteran, told lawmakers that she felt like her vote was meaningless after Governor DeSantis threatened to remove council members from office.

“I haven’t seen anything like this since what was reported in Germany in the 1930s,” James said. “People need to wake up.”

Examples like Fort Myers have experts worried that Republicans are trying to send a message to other officials who may disagree with their agenda.

“It is a very chilling effort to really silence duly elected local leaders who are doing what their constituents voted them into office to do,” said Belanger.

In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back. Lawsuits in Texas, Tennessee, and Florida have had mixed success. Local officials and activists have successfully blocked or mitigated preemption efforts through organizing efforts in recent years, according to a January report that Zellers co-authored. The wins, however, come at a cost.

“It’s a huge time-suck for advocates to try to counter these negative bills and put in the effort to try to get them stopped,” said Zellers.

Another approach, Fowler says, may be laying low.

“[Democrats] are figuring out how to operate in an environment where they don’t have to call attention to the things they’re doing,” Fowler said. “If they do the exact same things, and they just do it quietly behind closed doors, don’t really invite attention, they can normally get away with it,” adding that, “in bureaucracy, where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.
“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us.
“BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission.","On a recent Sunday morning in Provo, Utah, a small congregation of about two dozen people gathered in a church hall for ward services. At the front of the room stood the bishop, who blessed the bread and water in Spanish before passing the trays around for the congregation. The melodic sounds of the piano reverberated across the room as members sang “Welcome Home” — a new hymn for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Ward services like this have brought a consistent comfort and sense of community for Izzy, who came to Provo to study at Brigham Young University a few years ago. But lately, the increased possibility of ICE raids across the country has made him nervous.

“I just couldn’t focus. Just instant anxiety and fear. I worried about my family, and how I was gonna get through this year or the next four or three,” Izzy said. The prospect of an ICE recruitment fair nearby also disturbed him.

When he was just a toddler, Izzy and his parents came from Venezuela to the United States in search of a better life. Then one Christmas, Mormon missionaries brought gifts to their home in West Valley. He and his family were sealed in Utah. He was accepted into the DACA program, Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, years ago.

For many Latino members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is an ambivalent sense of the Church’s stance on immigrants. There is growing discontent about the Church’s silence regarding the ongoing ICE raids, compared to Catholic leaders like Pope Leo XIV, while others have focused on providing individual help to those in need.

The church has previously issued statements regarding immigration in 2011 and 2018 about the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. But its most recent statement published in January listed three points in order. While it reads similarly to past statements on loving thy neighbor and concern about keeping families together, the first point this time notably focused on “obeying the law.”

When The Times reached out to ask about why the new statement was numbered and in this order, the Church declined to comment.

Dr. David-James Gonzales, a ward leader and history professor at BYU who studies Latino civil rights and migration, notes that the political climate has shifted on immigration in 2025.

“This issue is one of the most polarizing issues nationally and it has split the Church,” he said, adding that it’s fair to question the way the statement is written. “If I’m analyzing it as a historian, it’s speaking to this moment that the Church needs to make clear to this administration that it’s not a sanctuary church.”

The Church does not release publicly any demographic data, but according to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 86% of the Church’s membership is white. Latinos are some of the fastest growing members worldwide, thanks to missionary work in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Peru.

Yet despite the growth in Spanish-speaking wards and a more diverse Mormon community, many interviewed for this story still feel they face challenges of racism and belonging.

This January, Brigham Young University shut down its “Dreamers” resource hub for undocumented students, after facing backlash from state leaders who complained that their tithings — or 10% obligated donations to the Church — were being used for illegal immigrants. Nori Gomez, the founding member of the Dreamer resource center, said the program’s offices started receiving threatening phone calls. The university eventually removed the resource page.

“It was the highlight of my BYU experience,” she said. “But with how much universities are being attacked right now, I don’t agree with it, but I see why.”

Students like Izzy had found a sense of community among other DACA recipients through these online resources. Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.

For former LDS leaders like Dr. Ignacio Garcia, a retired Latino studies professor and former bishop at a local Spanish-speaking ward, the Church’s silence has been disappointing.

“The Church’s struggle has a lot to do with some of its members, some of its very conservative white members,” Garcia said. “[These congregants] will love you as an individual member in your ward, but then go out and condemn all immigrants.”

In July, following hours of public comment from more than 100 community members opposing ICE’s presence in Utah, the Utah County Commission voted unanimously to enter a cooperative agreement with ICE to share data and work on a joint task force with local police. The county sheriff argued that a collaboration would allow more leeway for local officials to inject “Utah County values” into enforcement and public safety rather than allowing complete federal oversight.

Evelyn R. has worked as a trainer in Provo for young Mormons who are about to embark on their 18 to 24-month missions domestically and abroad. As a DACA recipient herself who previously served a Spanish-speaking mission in Georgia, she has overheard mixed feelings from attendees at the center about how undocumented people can even be baptized.

“[One girl said] you’re not really going to get anywhere with these people because they can’t get baptized. Because in order to be a member of the Church, you need to be abiding by the laws of the land, which is Article 12 of the faith,” Evelyn said.

Article 12 refers to a revelation written by Joseph Smith, stating, “we believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.” The article has guided members to be good citizens in their communities.

Evelyn said she had to ask her mission president if this was true. He reassured her that being undocumented did not gatekeep someone from belonging. It’s a stance that the First Presidency, the Church’s highest officials, also affirmed, saying that being undocumented should not itself prevent “an otherwise worthy Church member” from entering the temple or being ordained to priesthood, and calling upon congregation members to avoid being judgmental. As a convert to the Church and someone who comes from a diverse background, she said mixed responses like this were really hard to hear.

“God doesn’t care about our status or who we are, where we came from in order to be a member of the Church,” she said. Some days, she feels that she can identify as a member of the Church, but not necessarily as part of larger “Mormon culture” — one that might be predominantly white and more conservative on politics in Utah.

“We’re teaching principles and the doctrine of Christ,” she said. “I don’t think we’re necessarily learning how to apply those things.”

Luna Alvarez-Sproul, 25, works as a school teacher in Draper, Utah, where she often translates documents into Spanish for parents. She spent 18 months serving a Spanish-speaking mission in Salmon, Idaho, where many ranch hands were seasonal employees from Latin America.

“As a missionary, we didn’t have to receive special permission from somebody in order to baptize an undocumented individual,” she recalled. “But there [are] so many members of our church that don’t believe that they should be here with their families, which I feel is contradictory in and of itself.”

When guidance can vary so much, some church leaders have taken a more locally-focused ward approach — such as delivering food aid to members, helping out with rent or even sharing personal contacts with immigration lawyers. But addressing topics like the ICE raids during a service is likely taboo.

“Leaders are trained and asked to be very careful about how they address it. And I think that puts them in a really hard situation, especially when they have members of their congregation that are affected by this,” Izzy said.

The frustration may also have to do with reconciling religious principles with the views that are held by many people in the Church.

Other members disagree about an institution-wide response. Julia, who asked to use a pseudonym due to her undocumented status, has seen firsthand the ways that individual actions have been kind to her.

“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us. The gospel teaches us to be independent,” she said.

Utah also has infrastructure for many undocumented people to succeed in their daily life, she noted; it was the first state in 2005 to implement the “driver’s privilege card,” a driver’s license specifically for those who were undocumented, allowing them to commute to work and obtain insurance.

Just a few miles away in Orem, conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University during a debate less than a week before I conducted these interviews. Hundreds of students and local community members attended vigils, laying bouquets of fresh flowers and American flags alongside crosses and the Book of Mormon on university lawns. “If you want unity, say his name UV,” one poster said. Others were adorned with Bible verses as the air echoed with different Mormon hymns.

The LDS Church released a statement condemning the violence and lawless behavior.

Isa Benjamin Garcia spent some time reflecting on the week’s tragic events after the Sunday ward service. As a daughter of a Mexican immigrant, she became more worried when President Trump rescinded a Biden-era policy that excluded churches and schools from immigration raids.

“There’s a lot of rhetoric around violence, but it’s not acknowledged all the other violence that has been and is,” she said, referring to ICE raids, including an incident where a day laborer died after running away from ICE in California.

Other members echoed this sentiment. “Something I’ve been wrestling with over the last few months is why the Church doesn’t say, ‘This is wrong.’ Like this isn’t what Christ would have us do,” said Benjamin Garcia.

In August, BYU’s Office of Belonging launched an immigration-focused eight-week course to help people gain a “basic understanding of complex immigration policies.” The goal is to equip more nonprofit workers to become partially accredited to represent clients in front of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Gonzales, the ward leader and professor at BYU, believes this step speaks volumes about the Church’s efforts, despite challenges earlier this year with the takedown of its Dreamer center.

“My heart was warmed seeing that,” he said. “BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission. I think that’s a form of messaging through one of its institutions.”

Ultimately, when facing these hurdles and different interpretations of what the Book of Mormon or the Church says, members focus on their relationship to the gospel.

“We also believe that we are the Church, and we believe that it is our responsibility to make it better. And that is what God is asking of us, and that’s what Christ is asking of us,” Benjamin Garcia said. She then paused.

“Despite feelings of frustration or questions, what keeps a lot of us here, despite any of that, is that we have a conviction.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1e23ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+392/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2Fb8%2Fadcf55ed4d6290a180ca634208ff%2Fmormonlatinos-1.png,N,,2025-10-09 16:57:02.939659

With such a constant deluge of attacks on our rights —and on our communities—it can feel difficult to stay hopeful and engaged. But our history shows that when people organize, protest, and demand justice, we can disrupt abuses of power, and build collective power in response.

​​So how exactly do we show up at this moment to defend our freedoms? Below, you’ll find answers to five of the most pressing questions we’ve received about how to push back against the Trump administration’s abuses of power. This is the third in our ongoing series, “Your Questions Answered,” where we bring your questions directly to ACLU experts.

With all these attacks on our fundamental rights, where do we even start? What actions can make a real difference?

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and wonder where to even start, but I’ve seen firsthand how powerful it is when millions take action together. The first “No Kings” mobilization proved that. From my vantage point on the core organizing team, I watched in awe as millions filled the streets in one of the largest demonstrations in modern memory. More than 2,000 events—from major cities to small towns where half the community turned out—sent one clear message: we, the people, reject abuses of power and will defend our communities. Being part of the team that helped support that day was one of the proudest moments of my life. But the real power came from everyone who marched, proudly asserted their free speech rights even in the face of intimidation, and showed that our communities are strongest when we stand together.

That’s why I’m so excited for the next “No Kings” rally on October 18. “No Kings” isn’t just another protest— it’s a bold and joyful assertion of our rights. A reminder of what we can do, and who we can be, when we defend our communities against abuses of power.

Whether you rally with your community, contact members of Congress, or display a sign in your front yard championing the principles of a free America, every action—big or small—contributes to the movement.

Does contacting members of Congress actually work? How do we get them to pay attention to the issues we care about?

Contacting members of Congress works. I’ve seen it firsthand. I used to work in Congressional offices and was once the one helping organize in-district town halls, answering calls, and reading emails from constituents. In the offices I worked in, every message was logged and, when enough people reached out about an issue, it was noticed and noticed fast. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a point made in a constituent’s email or call to be used as part of a member’s argument for or against a policy. Many times I have seen personal stories shared by constituents end up in floor speech, mentioned in press conferences, or even featured in newsletters.

Lawmakers rely on constituent stories and perspectives, which shape the narrative and help ground policy in real impacts. There are so many ways you can reach out to your members:

Sending an email or using a digital action tool like aclu.org/action

Calling offices through the Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121 to be connected to your representatives/senators

Attending town halls or events

Requesting meetings with staff

Your outreach matters and is so important—not just to inform and persuade, but also to hold elected officials accountable for the choices they make and votes they take.

—Elvia Montoya, senior advisor, Policy & Government Affairs

Beyond Congress, who should we be pressuring? Are local actions impactful? And if so, what are some ways I can get more involved in my local community?

Time and time again, it is the leadership of local and state leaders who uphold our civil rights and liberties. That’s why we have the mandate to meet this moment by standing with them and by partnering with them to pass responsive policies that protect all of our communities. It’s also why I’m so proud to be here at the ACLU, one of the few organizations designed to meet this moment, because of the incredible work of our 54 affiliates across the country. The Firewall for Freedom campaign has already led to dozens of actions being taken across this country. That includes mayors, city councils, state attorneys general, governors and state legislators. Each of us should join our affiliates in calling on officials to pass these Firewall measures to advance and protect our rights, especially in cases of federal overreach.

—Nahal Zamani, director of State Campaigns

It’s alarming to see the government censoring journalists, silencing talk show hosts, and deporting activists. How do we defend free speech when it’s under attack at every level?

The government’s actions are designed to instill fear in all of us because they know that the power of the people is stronger than the people in power. So, they want to silence us. But as we have seen again and again when we raise our voices, we create change. We have seen communities come together to speak up against the separation of families and the tearing apart of community members resulting in the release of mothers, children and students from immigration detention. We have seen how Jimmy Kimmel’s show returned to the air just hours after over 475 artists and 40,000 ACLU supporters signed a letter condemning the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel due to pressure from the administration.

I am proud to lead the ACLU’s Know Your Rights work to ensure that people know how the Constitution protects all of us regardless of immigration status. Just this year, we have empowered thousands of people with the information they need to protect themselves, their neighbors and their communities.

Sticking together works. Raising our voices works. Holding the government accountable works. This moment calls for all of us to do everything we can to protect each other, protect our democracy, and protect our rights.

—Maribel Hernández Rivera, national director of Immigrant Community Strategies

What gives the ACLU hope in this moment — hope that we can defend our neighbors, communities, and the future of democracy?

I remember hearing someone at the ACLU of Georgia say that “we’re not new to this— we’re true to this.” That really stuck with me: the fact that we’ve been here before. The ACLU has been in this fight for more than 100 years. That’s more than 100 years of resistance, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of justice. Our communities have faced attacks on civil liberties before, and we’ve never backed down. If we’ve made it this far, how can we give up now?

I draw strength from those who came before: the ancestors and organizers who dedicated their lives to move us forward. Their sacrifices remind me that this fight is not new, and it’s not any one person’s burden to bear alone. On our organizing team, we’re grounded in the truth that it takes all of us. Thousands of us are in this struggle, standing shoulder to shoulder and refusing to be silenced.

As the child of immigrants, I carry a profound belief in hope—the same hope that led my parents to this country, dreaming of a better life for their children. To give up now would betray that belief. So I won't. That’s what gives me hope: our history, our people, and the power of refusing to give up.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November.
CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss.
“Election Law Blog: “The Supreme Court Is Being Tested on History Once Again”” October 7: The New Civil Rights Movement quoted CAC in their article covering oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar at the Supreme Court.
He also worked as an associate in the Supreme Court and appellate practice of Hogan Lovells.","This week, the Supreme Court’s new Term began, and the Court isn’t wasting any time before digging into incredibly important issues. CAC has filed in many of the big cases the Court will be hearing at the beginning of this Term.

On Monday, in Villarreal v. Texas, the Court considered whether a defendant’s right to counsel was violated when he was prohibited from discussing his own testimony with his attorney at a critical point in his trial. Our amicus brief explained why his Sixth Amendment rights were violated. As CAC Appellate Counsel Ana Builes explained after listening to oral argument in the case, “By prohibiting Mr. Villarreal from consulting with his counsel about important aspects of his case at a critical stage of his trial, the Texas trial court denied him his counsel’s assistance when he needed it the most and denied him the fair trial that the Sixth Amendment guarantees.”

And on Tuesday, in Chiles v. Salazar, the Court considered whether Colorado can prohibit licensed mental health professionals from practicing “conversion therapy” on young people, given the consensus in the medical community that this practice is deeply harmful. Our amicus brief explained that it does not violate the First Amendment for states to protect their residents from such dangerous practices. As CAC’s Vice President Praveen Fernandes wrote after oral argument, “The Court has long acknowledged states’ power to shield their residents from ineffectual or harmful practices by state-licensed professionals.”

Next week, the Court will hear Ellingburg v. United States. Though the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits Congress from retroactively making a punishment more severe, Holsey Ellingburg was told he must pay nearly double the amount of restitution he was assigned at his sentencing, solely due to changes in the law after his crime occurred. Our brief explains why the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to the restitution law Congress passed after Mr. Ellingburg’s crime.

And on October 15, the Court is hearing Louisiana v. Callais, a case with high stakes for the future of the Voting Rights Act. Our amicus brief explains that the Constitution gives Congress broad enforcement power to prevent impairment of the right to vote, including through the protections of the Voting Rights Act. As CAC’s David H. Gans explained in Slate magazine, drawing on his exciting new research on Black advocacy for voting rights in the aftermath of the Civil War, this ought to be an “open-and-shut” case if the Roberts court is faithful to constitutional text and history. Also on October 15, the Court is considering whether police may enter homes without warrants based on less than probable cause that an emergency is occurring. Our amicus brief details why allowing such entries would be at odds with the Fourth Amendment’s text and history.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November. When Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian who wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion, showed prison officials a printout of a court decision holding that the law protected his right to keep his dreadlocks in prison, the officials threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights, the lower courts held that the law protecting the religious freedom of incarcerated people does not provide for damages against individual state officials. Our amicus brief explains that the law protected Landor’s ability to vindicate his rights.

On November 12, the Court will consider two cases about the scope of a sentencing judge’s discretion to grant compassionate release under the Sentencing Reform Act. In Rutherford v. United States and Carter v. United States, the Court is considering whether a judge can grant reductions in a petitioner’s sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act because of a significant difference between the sentence they are serving and the sentence that they would have received if they were sentenced for those same offenses today. Our amicus brief explains that judges should be allowed to consider major changes in the law that result in sentencing disparities solely based on when a person was sentenced. And in Fernandez v. United States, our amicus brief explains that a judge should be allowed to consider his “disquiet” about the validity of the jury’s verdict in granting compassionate release.

Needless to say, things have been very busy here at CAC. Even as we continue to support legal challenges to unlawful actions taken by the Trump administration, we’re also still fighting for our Constitution’s progressive promise at the Supreme Court.

San Francisco v. Trump— The District Court for the Northern District of California is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that decline to implement his immigration agenda. CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss. Our brief explains why the administration’s actions are a violation of separation-of-powers principles, and that Supreme Court precedent allows the constitutional claims at issue to be reviewed by the courts. Northern California District Court, brief filed October 7.

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission — The Supreme Court is considering whether to strike down a law that limits the amount of money a national political party committee may spend in coordination with federal candidates for elected office. CAC filed an amicus brief asking the court to uphold the law’s coordinated party expenditure limits, explaining that the law is narrowly tailored to target corruption concerns dating back to the Founders, and that Supreme Court precedent permits contributions limits such as those considered here. Supreme Court, brief filed October 6.

National Treasury Employees Union v. Vought — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether to rehear en banc the case regarding the Trump administration’s efforts to unilaterally shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our amicus brief explains why the administration’s actions violate the Constitution’s separation of powers, and why the constitutional claim at issue is judicially reviewable under Supreme Court precedent. C. Circuit, brief filed September 30.

PFLAG v. Trump — The Fourth Circuit is considering whether President Trump can legally cut off federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of nineteen. CAC filed a brief explaining why constitutional history, centuries of executive practice and court precedent, and separation-of-powers principles prohibit the President from usurping Congress’s power of the purse in an attempt to achieve his own policy initiatives. Fourth Circuit, brief filed September 26.

RAICES v. Noem — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration’s efforts to prohibit certain people in the country from seeking asylum is lawful. CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that the law does not allow the government to “repatriate” asylum-seekers that are already within the country, and that the administration’s actions would upend the asylum system Congress established. C. Circuit, brief filed September 19.

Novartis v. Secretary United States Department of Health and Human Services — WIN — The Third Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Medicare prescription drug price negotiation program at issue in this case, rejecting Novartis’s constitutional arguments, including its Takings Clause argument. Echoing our brief and citing the court’s earlier ruling in Bristol Myers Squibb v. Becerra, the court emphasized the voluntary nature of the government’s program and concluded that there is no physical taking. Third Circuit, decision rendered September 11.

Parada v. United States — The Supreme Court is being asked to consider whether the Sixth Amendment requires a 12-person jury for a felony conviction. After being convicted by a jury of only eleven people, the petitioners are asking the Court to hear their case and reconsider precedent that allows such a conviction. CAC filed a brief in support of the petitioners, explaining that at the Founding and throughout common law, juries were understood to consist of twelve people. We argue that the prior case that allowed such small juries improperly dismissed the history of the Sixth Amendment. Supreme Court, brief filed September 11.

Properties of the Villages, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission — After the change in presidential administrations, the FTC moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal, acceding to the vacatur of the noncompete rule at issue in the case. Eleventh Circuit, case dismissed September 10.

C. v. Metropolitan School District of Martinsville — The Seventh Circuit is considering whether the Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Skrmetti requires it to overrule previous decisions recognizing that schools that prohibit students from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity are discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX. CAC filed a brief in support of a transgender boy whose school had such a policy, explaining that the Court’s decision in Skrmetti­—a case involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors—should have no effect on precedent regarding gender-aligned bathroom use. Seventh Circuit, brief filed September 10.

Newsom v. Trump — The Ninth Circuit is considering the legality of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to mostly peaceful protests. CAC filed a brief explaining that, contrary to the Trump administration’s arguments, Supreme Court precedent does not prohibit courts from reviewing presidential decisions to federalize the National Guard, and that founding-era history demonstrates that judges may appropriately evaluate whether the necessary factual conditions exist to justify such action. Ninth Circuit, brief filed September 9.

Ortega v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — WIN — The Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review and dismissed the Seventh Amendment claim against the OCC. Echoing our brief, the court detailed the history of the national banking system and explained that “such a serious and unbroken historical pedigree” proves that “the public-rights exception applies to federal banking enforcement actions, and that petitioners had no right to a jury trial in this matter.” Fifth Circuit, decision rendered September 8.

That's just one of the many legal battles playing out.

A small group of protestors gathered outside the ICE processing facility, with their chants energized following a federal judge's extension of a nationwide consent decree. The 52-page ruling outlines who ICE agents can and can not arrest.

Since ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" concerns have been raised about the random way federal agents have come into the Chicagoland area, detaining people. Hundreds of people have since been taken into custody without warrants or probable cause.

""We now have potentially 200 on our list of potential violations. The vast majority being in the last several weeks,"" Attorney Mark Fleming said.

The National Immigration Justice Center is one of many that filed suit. The agency said it's also going to court about the violations they said took place when federal agents raided a South Shore apartment building, detaining both immigrants and Chicago residents in the middle of the night.

Back in Broadview, police are enforcing protest times after an executive order was signed by the village's mayor this week. Police were seen giving a warning shortly after 6 p.m. to disperse, or people would face citations or be arrested.

While many rally against the deportations, the biggest fight will play out in the federal courthouse.

""It's a glimpse of hope that the courts will still, at times, bear witness and will attempt to limit the harms being conducted by DHS in our communities,"" Said Xanat Sobrevilla, Organized Communities Against Deportations.

On Thursday morning, the city of Chicago and Illinois' attorney general will head to court. It's their attempt to stop the more than 200 National Guard members brought in from Texas from hitting the streets. The guards are currently stationed about 55 miles southwest of Chicago in Elwood. City, county, and state leaders are hoping the legal move will deter any movement.

""The judge didn't explicitly state they couldn't come into the city, but I think if you read between the lines as to what she was saying, that it probably would be a good idea if everybody waited til she made the decision on Thursday to decide what they're going to do,"" legal analyst Irv Miller said.

Thursday determines if the guards move in and what happens in court, including whether the fence placed outside this facility will stay or go.

According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks.
""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office.
The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.
It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""","The ACLU of Colorado and several law firms are suing the Trump Administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a new federal lawsuit filed on Thursday. They allege ICE is arresting people across Colorado without warrants and without determining if the people they're arresting are citizens or not.

The groups, which also include the Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, filed the suit on behalf of Refugio Ramirez Ovando, Caroline Dias Goncalves, two other plaintiffs who are only identified by their initials, and ""all those similarly situated.""

""People are terrified that masked agents will snatch their loved ones or neighbors from the street because an ICE agent believes they look different or speak with an accent. This is unacceptable,"" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, said in a statement. ""The courts must see ICE's actions for what they are: an unlawful abuse of power that must be stopped.""

The ICE Denver field office responded Thursday that it does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation. After publication of this story, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CBS News Colorado through a department spokesperson, ""DHS complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.""

The suit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE acting director Todd Lyons, and ICE Denver Field Office director Robert Guadian as defendants. It alleges ""militarized"" ICE agents, ""often with masks, body armor, and long guns,"" are ""indiscriminately stopping and arresting people with brown skin in their mission to meet the Administration's ramped-up enforcement demands.""

The organizations that filed the suit are asking a judge to make this a class-action lawsuit, determine whether these arrests violated federal law, and, if deemed illegal, order ICE to stop future warrantless arrests.

One of the plaintiffs, Dias Goncalves, is a 19-year-old nursing student living in Utah who was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy in May and then reported to ICE, which state officials and the ACLU say violated state law. According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks. She has lived in the U.S. since she was brought here from Brazil as a Dreamer at 7.

Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father who's lived in Colorado for 20 years, according to the lawsuit, which claims that ICE mistakenly arrested him in May without a warrant and while looking for someone else. Ovando says he was held at the Aurora ICE facility for three months, the suit alleges.

One plaintiff, identified by his initials, J.S.T., is a 36-year-old asylum seeker who was arrested without a warrant during a large operation across Denver and Aurora in February, according to the lawsuit. He was held at the detention center for four weeks.

And the other plaintiff, identified by the initials ""G.R.R.,"" alleges he was arrested without a warrant during a large federal operation in Colorado Springs in April. The lawsuit says the 32-year-old father and business owner was held at the detention center for over six weeks.

The four plaintiffs named in the suit serve as representatives of an unknown number of people arrested in Colorado, as well as those who may be arrested in the future. They include ""All persons since January 20, 2025, who have been arrested or will be arrested in this District by ICE without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk,"" according to the suit.

""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office. ""The courts must act to halt this widespread and egregious ICE practice of arresting people without warrants based on how they look, how they speak, or simply because of who they are with. This practice is a frontal assault on our communities to advance Trump's mass deportation agenda.""

The suit says ICE is violating certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits warrantless arrests unless agents have ""reason to believe"" that a person is both unlawfully in the U.S. and that the person ""is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest."" The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.

It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.
One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.
They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments.
The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.","The Department of Homeland Security has been sending out “management directed reassignments” to dozens of employees, forcing staff in some cases to choose whether to move hundreds of miles to a new job or face termination.

DHS has sent the reassignments out to employees across the department, including at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to multiple people familiar with the directives. They were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.

Employees have been handed reassignments to different DHS components, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Protective Service.

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.

The latest shifts come after DHS transferred more than 100 employees to ICE in August, including 50 staff from FEMA’s human resources department, according to the Washington Post.

“DHS routinely aligns personnel to meet mission priorities while ensuring continuity across all core mission areas,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any notion that DHS is unprepared to handle threats to our nation because of these realignments is ludicrous, especially given the abject failure at the hands of CISA in the last administration.”

One reassignment notice viewed by Federal News Network gave an employee seven days to decide on a reassignment hundreds of miles from their current duty station. If accepted, the “goal” would be to complete the reassignment within 60 days, according to the letter.

Declining the reassignment, or accepting but failing to report for duty, would subject the employee to removal from federal service, the letter added.

One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.

So far, the DHS employee said most staff who have responded – either to accept the reassignment or reject the move – have yet to hear back.

They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments. Employees who accept management-directed reassignments can be reimbursed for relocation expenses. Last month, the Office of Personnel Management paused the relocation of some OPM staff after facing significant costs.

Federal News Network has reached out to DHS for comment.

The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont.
Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.
“They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.” Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far.
But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.","Democrats in Congress have been relentless about casting the government shutdown clash as a fight over helping Americans pay for health insurance.

But there is another, far deeper issue driving the impasse: their outrage about what is happening across the country under a president they regard as lawless and unchecked.

While Democrats believe they have a winning political argument in demanding the extension of Obamacare subsidies, they are also motivated by Mr. Trump’s extreme policies and tactics, and his penchant for running roughshod over the legislative branch with scant pushback from congressional Republicans. That is one reason that the shutdown impasse has dragged on, with no immediate move toward resolution and little sign that Democrats’ resolve is flagging.

Democrats have watched with increasing alarm as the administration has ignored congressional spending directives, dispatched the military to American cities, ordered government retribution against Mr. Trump’s perceived adversaries and mounted an aggressive immigration roundup that has prompted fierce fights in the courts.

“The issue that we are debating,” Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday, “is not just health care, as enormously important as that is. What we are talking about is whether we are going to allow our country to move toward an authoritarian society, run by a president who is a megalomaniac, who wants more and more power in his hands, who does not respect the rule of law or the Constitution of the United States of America.’’

Democrats have good reasons to center the shutdown fight around the extension of pandemic-era Obamacare health insurance subsidies. They fear that millions of Americans could see their coverage costs soar or become unaffordable without quick action by Congress. It is a unifying subject and has strong political resonance. The impact of not intervening would be felt by both Democratic and Republican voters, providing an opening to reach across the aisle for a solution.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. “And one of the reasons I think the health care fight is the right fight is that the folks who are going to be hurt are folks who voted for Trump, and folks who didn’t.”

Democrats employ language in describing the Trump administration that would be considered extraordinary in the past, but is becoming almost commonplace now, illustrating the depth of their apprehension about the administration and their dark view of its capabilities.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and one of the lawmakers central to ending the spending impasse, described the Trump administration this week as “run by crooks and cowards.”

Others were equally disparaging.

“We have a government that has been hijacked at the highest levels by people who act like mob bosses,” Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who was elected just last year, said in a floor speech. “I’m from Jersey. We know a thing or two about mob bosses.”

Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat and one of those who broke with the majority of his party last March by voting to fund the government, has this time seen Mr. Trump dispatch Texas National Guard troops to his home state over objections from Illinois leaders, a move unlikely to win Mr. Durbin’s support on spending.

“Instead of working to find a bipartisan way to reopen the government and lower the cost of health care, President Trump is solely focused on scoring points against his perceived enemies,” Mr. Durbin said.

A secondary goal of the Democrats in the standoff is to win guarantees against the administration overriding congressionally approved spending plans in the future, though Democrats have chosen not to emphasize that aspect. They see it as inside baseball and do not want to distract from their focus on health insurance, which has more relevance to the general public.

Democrats also worry about the willingness of their Republican congressional colleagues to enforce any agreement, even though they say their G.O.P. colleagues assure them privately that they intend to resist more attempts by the White House to counter spending approved by Congress.

But so far, congressional Republicans have stood by complacently as Mr. Trump has usurped congressional authority in numerous ways, including his widespread imposition of tariffs without congressional action, and his instigation of military actions, such as deadly attacks on boats that the administration said were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea. A Democratic attempt to block those strikes won just two Republican supporters Wednesday night as the measure failed in the Senate.

Senate Republicans have also found ways to sidestep Democrats this year by stretching the rules covering what legislation is subject to the filibuster, and changing the rules to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump nominees. Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.

“They just can’t fathom having to deal with us,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “They haven’t needed our votes. And so this is the first time that they’re confronted with the idea that we are not irrelevant, and it is making them angry.”

Republicans attribute the Democratic refusal to reopen the government without concessions on health insurance to their desire to placate elements of the party that have insisted on blanket resistance to Mr. Trump at any cost.

“It is sort of this blind Trump derangement syndrome if you will,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said on Fox News. “They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.”

Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far. But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.

“We’ve got to have faith we can get through this,” said Mr. Welch. “We’ve got to maintain as much as we can.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:58:22.134449

Trump Administration Fires Immigration Judges

The Trump Administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, with ICE agents and National Guard troops deployed to cities across the country. And federal efforts to crack down are not solely focused on detainment, but also removing the judges that oversee immigration cases. Last month the administration fired dozens of immigration judges across the country, including three in Sacramento. These removals have raised alarms, and some within the judicial community are warning of a potential “chilling effect” for years to come. CapRadio Statehouse Politics Reporter Gerardo Zavala breaks down some of the reactions to these firings, and what the impacts are on local immigrants that need their legal services.

Don Craven, who had led the IPA since 2021, added the organization to the lawsuit Sunday alongside other Illinois news outlets and advocacy groups. The IPA board disagreed with the decision and told him “to do whatever necessary to dismiss the IPA as a Plaintiff in that litigation,” which Craven did before submitting his resignation, according to an email Craven wrote to an organization of other press associations Wednesday.

Craven wrote that his decision as the IPA’s President, CEO and legal counsel was based on the lawsuit’s aim “to preserve and protect the First Amendment rights of journalists.” Attempts to reach Craven for additional comment were not immediately returned.

The plaintiffs, which include digital news site Block Club Chicago and the Chicago News Guild among others, specifically cite violent actions from ICE agents toward reporters covering protests at a facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“Journalists reported being singled out for detention, being shot by rubber bullets, and being exposed to gas pellets, all because they were doing their jobs,” Craven wrote in his email. “A minister, in clerical garb, was shot at and gassed, while praying in front of the facility.”

The IPA board did not respond to a request for comment. It released a statement to the association’s members Wednesday afternoon, which read that a six-person executive team will oversee operations as the board begins recruiting candidates.

The IPA aims to provide “legislative, business, advertising, educational and legal services” for the 375 daily and weekly newspapers in its membership, according to its website. It is one of the largest newspaper associations in the country.

The IPA is a part of the Newspaper Association Managers, a fraternal organization of press associations across the country which organizes discussions among members on relevant industry issues. Layne Bruce, the executive director of the Mississippi Press Association who serves as the volunteer clerk for NAM, said this news will “without a doubt” be on the agenda for NAM’s next meeting in December.

“As far as I’m aware, this is the most significant development in a press association in the current political climate,” he said.

A mix of news organizations and independent protesters filed the lawsuit Monday, listing ICE officials, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump among the defendants.

Jonathan Manes, senior counsel for the MacArthur Justice Center and professor at Pritzker School of Law on press freedom and freedom of information, said this is an “incredibly important lawsuit.”

Several workers appeared to have been arrested. Video posted on social media shows ICE officers, some wearing masks and some not, alongside FHP officers at the business. The streets in a one-block area around the business were blocked by FHP during the raid.

Detained workers were placed in a bus labeled ""Escambia County Corrections.""

The News Journal has requested information about the raid from the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, FHP, and Escambia County. So far, Escambia County is the only agency to respond to the News Journal's request.

Escambia County spokesperson Davis Wood told the News Journal that ICE requested transportation assistance from the county, but any further information about the operation would have to be released by ICE.

""Escambia County Corrections periodically provides resources by request for inter-agency operations where multiple arrests are possible, whether it’s a federal, state or local agency,"" Wood said.

Video posted to social media also showed an Escambia County ambulance near the site, but Wood said that ambulance was responding to an unrelated call for service.

Pensacola Police Department spokesperson Mike Wood told the News Journal that PPD was not involved in the raid, but one detective was on scene solely as an observer because it was occurring within the city limits.

Grace Resendez McCaffery, publisher of the Spanish-language newspaper La Costa Latina and founder of the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, told the News Journal that several workers were likely arrested at the site, including workers who had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Resendez McCaffery said a woman called her from the bus where the detained workers had been placed. She said the woman was told by one ICE agent she wouldn't be arrested after showing her documentation, but another said to ""take her anyway.""

""They’re not even distinguishing between documented and undocumented,"" Resendez McCaffery said.

Resendez McCaffery said it's unclear how many workers were arrested as she's had several families reach out to her. One report she received said it could be as many as 30, though she is not confident in that number. She said those detained were told they were being transported to the Escambia County jail.

Through her work with the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, Resendez McCaffery has monitored the stepped-up immigration under the Trump administration. She noted that, although there have been other raids in Northwest Florida and many in Baldwin County, Alabama, this was the first large-scale raid to occur in Pensacola.

U.S. District Judge April Perry was hearing arguments in a packed downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

Perry pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Perry called the Trump administration's claims of a so-called rebellion ""audacious"" and questioned the information being used to deploy the guard.

""What if the DHS folks are not tethered to reality? Does that matter?"" she said, asking ""who are the rebels"" and ""are they well armed?""

Thursday's hearing before Perry was over a request to block the deployment of Illinois and Texas Guard members in Illinois.

Chicago and Illinois filed a lawsuit on Monday to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. In a court filing in the lawsuit, the city and state say protests at a temporary ICE detention facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

Local

Christopher Wells, a lawyer with the Illinois attorney general’s office, began Thursday's hearing by urging Perry to stop the National Guard deployment that “threatens the careful balance of our Constitutional system.”

Hamilton characterized Chicago as beset by what he called “tragic lawlessness,” noting a recent confrontation in which two residents were accused of using their vehicles to ram into and box in a Border Patrol vehicle. One person was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent.

Some Guard members ordered to Illinois by President Donald Trump now are protecting federal property near Chicago.

New video showed uniformed troops appearing to arrive at the Immigration Customs and Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview early Thursday morning, with soldiers seen behind a fenced area carrying shields, duffle bags and other equipment in and out of the building.

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night’s sleep, too.""

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past. Ellis issued a temporary restraining order Thursday with guidelines for how agents can interact with protesters and the press.

Interviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.

ICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.

Elias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”

The Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration

Observers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.

Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.

Melson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.

“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.

Forceful arrests alleged

Elias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.

Melson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.

Less than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.

While in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.

She claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department, and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.

Melson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.

Protecting the right to protest

Especially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.

“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”

According to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”

The lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”

Christine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”

Elias and Melson demanded a jury trial and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

Update (10/8/2025): This story was updated after the borough solicitor confirmed the defendants would not comment on the lawsuits.

""Immigration agents are keeping people from enjoying the basic things of life.""","CHICAGO – Ivy-covered walls. Forty thousand people singing in the middle of the seventh inning. The hope of raising a white flag with a symbolic ""W.""

Gametime at Wrigley Field on Oct. 8, a National League Division Series matchup between the Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers, carried on as if things were normal in Chicago. And the Cubs' hopes for another trip to the World Series stayed alive with a 4-3 victory.

But away from the Friendly Confines, residents say something never seen before is underway.

""Our communities are being terrorized by agents who are kidnapping people,"" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider. ""People are living in fear of going out to get groceries, dropping their kids off at school. People are strategizing how to get three or five blocks to work.""

Since President Donald Trump launched his immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz, life in and around Chicago has been upended.

The White House says the crackdown is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Local officials say it’s a power grab. Residents feeling the brunt of the crackdown say immigration agents are making life untenable.

Scenes from the blitz include a Mexican man fatally shot by immigration agents in the northwest suburbs who said the man drove his car into an officer; federal officials deploying chemical agents on protesters and journalists outside the local immigration enforcement facility; and agents rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters to raid a South Side apartment building in the middle of the night.

Department of Homeland Security officials said on Oct. 8 that they had ""arrested more than 1,500 illegal aliens − including criminal pedophiles, murderers, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers"" in connection with the blitz. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify Homeland Security’s arrests.

Most recently, Trump said he would jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson for resisting the administration's crime-fighting goals in the city. National Guard troops are now deploying to the area.

Here’s a look at how the blitz is affecting people in the Chicago area, from near the Wisconsin border to Indiana.

South Side parking lot stakeout

In the predawn hours Oct. 7, dozens of Chicagoans gathered near an empty parking lot off a busy thoroughfare on the South Side.

The early hour, they told reporters at the scene, was in response to the schedule they noticed immigration enforcement agents were keeping. They said they hoped to be able to document agents carrying out their duties.

Federal agents arrived at the parking lot in the Back of the Yards neighborhood and set up a staging point for operations. The Yards Plaza lot is off the major thoroughfare of 47th Street near schools and a Home Depot.

Residents say masked men carrying guns take people off the streets in the surrounding area and bring them to the lot to move them into a van to be taken elsewhere.

""We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. ... . Now the streets are empty,"" said Pedraza, adding she worries about students in the area witnessing agents at work. ""Imagine being a first grader and seeing agents with military weapons, masked men. No child should have to pass through that.""

'Agents have created a war zone in our community,' local alderwoman says

Among the people on hand was local alderwoman Julia Ramirez. The City Council member said she came to fight back for residents she sees as caught in a ""war zone.""

""People can't live their lives the way they did before,"" Ramirez said. ""Agents have created a war zone in our community.""

Many of the people there were members of what’s known as the Southwest Side Rapid Response team, a group of volunteers that aims to document immigration enforcement actions and confirm sightings of immigration agents.

Pedraza, a team member, said neighborhood residents looking to leave the house will give her a call first to see about the latest confirmed immigration agent sightings.

After assembling in the morning, team members were seen standing on corners throughout the neighborhood, notably at sites where immigration agents have been reported before, including the Home Depot.

The Southwest Side team is one of many active throughout the Chicago area. Many regularly broadcast confirmed immigration agent sightings.

DHS officials have criticized those efforts, saying activists tracking federal immigration agents are endangering law enforcement officers who are doing their jobs.

On Oct. 8, the Southwest Side team reported sightings of immigration agents in the area that included the make, model and license plate number of immigration agents’ vehicles.

Across town, on the Northwest Side, another team reported seeing eight immigration agents' vehicles, including a white SUV with a Mexican flag on the hood. Locals believe agents are adding Mexican flags to cars to act as a decoy.

Teams in the suburbs also reported immigration agent sightings on Oct. 8, saying that in Oak Park, Berwyn and Cicero, volunteers ""were able to confirm that ICE was active in our communities and abducted at least two of our neighbors.""

Rapid-response teams respond to calls to a hotline organized by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Spokesperson Brandon Lee said their role consists of documenting federal law enforcement, not interfering with their work.

Friendly Confines still full of 'joy'

Amid the increasingly aggressive crackdown, many in Chicago are trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and big events help eclipse the national spotlight that comes from immigration agents clashing with residents or Trump calling for the governor’s arrest.

""It’s sometimes hard living your own life knowing all this is happening,"" said Jeanne Uehling, a Chicagoan of more than 20 years attending the Cubs game Oct. 8. ""It’s surreal that at work I have to care about someone turning something in when there are helicopters landing and raiding people.""

The downtown office worker spoke with USA TODAY outside Wrigley Field with longtime friend Julie Murphy. They said that they were going to the game despite the president calling Chicago a hellhole.

""We have to still feel joy, and this city has so much joy,"" said Murphy, who originally moved to the city from the suburbs. ""People outside the city, they don’t know what's going on. They think we're being rescued somehow.""

The game and crowds teeming up and down Clark Street outside the stadium are just the latest example of the city letting loose to enjoy itself. During a break in the first inning, fans stopped to sing ""Y.M.C.A.,"" a notable Trump anthem that has also been a Wrigley Field staple for years.

Hundreds of swimmers recently competed in races in the city’s river for the first time in nearly a century. The inaugural Chicago River Swim comes after decades spent cleaning the former industrial waterway.

For Sunday, Oct. 12, the city was preparing for its annual marathon, in which more than 53,000 runners were expected to compete. The race showcases the city’s iconic downtown Loop neighborhood.

'Closed due to the situation'

Unpredictable immigration raids and the deployment of National Guard troops have the region on edge.

""Over the past few weeks we’ve all felt it: families afraid to leave their homes and go to school, parents kissing their kids goodbye not knowing they’ll make it home. That’s something nobody should have to live with,"" said Edwin Lagunas of Toluca’s Restaurant in Waukegan.

Lagunas, who was born and raised in the Chicago suburb, spoke at a news conference Oct. 7 held in response to at least seven people being detained by agents in the area the day before.

The crackdown has had a severe impact on life in the area, locals say. Toluca’s and other neighborhood spots had signs posted saying that they were ""closed due to the situation"" until at least Oct. 9, when a federal judge in Chicago was expected to rule on the question of whether National Guard troops may remain in the area.

Sandra Fajardo, owner of a popular indoor soccer complex, said that suddenly teams had begun showing up with players missing, or canceling games outright.

""What’s happening in our city right now is heartbreaking,"" the Waukegan native said. ""Immigration agents are keeping people from enjoying the basic things of life.""

TALLAHASSEE — An appeals-court panel on Thursday grilled attorneys about a new state law making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to enter Florida, questioning whether enforcement and oversight of such issues should be left to the federal government.

The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law during a February special session aimed at helping President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.

The law (SB 4-C) makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter or re-enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”

Attorneys for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida and two individual plaintiffs filed a challenge in federal court in South Florida, alleging the law is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in April issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law, saying it was likely preempted by federal immigration-enforcement authority. In part, she pointed to part of the law requiring that violators go to jail and indicated that could conflict with federal authority.

A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday heard arguments in the state’s appeal of Williams’ order. The legal battle over the law has been highly contentious, with Williams taking the unusual step of finding Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt because of a letter he sent to law enforcement agencies indicating he could not prevent police from enforcing the law after Williams ordered a halt.

Thursday’s arguments touched on the contempt order but focused on the underlying dispute about Florida’s authority to make it a crime for people who are in the country without authorization to enter the state.

Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was joined on the panel by judges Charles Wilson and Barbara Lagoa, pressed Jeffrey DeSousa, the state’s acting solicitor general, about the preemption issue.

“The federal government has created a scheme where only certain illegal entry or re-entry offenses are prosecuted, others are taken care of civilly through the removal process, but you think that’s not field preempted?” Jordan asked.

DeSousa pointed to previous court rulings establishing that “states could have precisely the kinds of regulations that Florida has adopted” and saying that “states aren’t powerless to deter the influx of immigrants into the United States illegally, and that’s all that Florida has done here.”

DeSousa also argued that federal immigration law “is primarily concerned with admissibility regulations” about who can enter the country.

Lagoa, a former Florida Supreme Court justice, asked DeSousa about part of the law that says people who are arrested pose a flight risk and must be held without bond.

“It seems like a strange way to handle it. It causes me some concern,” she said.

The panel’s review of Williams’ preliminary injunction “is governed by the abuse of discretion standards,” Jordan told DeSousa, noting that other courts that have considered similar state laws have found that they were preempted by federal authority.

“The general default principle is you don’t do merits review in a preliminary injunction appeal because the judge is weighing probabilities, and that’s a quintessential discretionary call unless there’s a clear error of judgment,” Jordan said.

But DeSousa argued that preliminary injunctions “have proliferated over the last decade.”

“This is a huge rule-of-law problem for states because a district court that wrongfully imposes a PI (preliminary injunction), as we think happened here, can effectively pause a state’s law for potentially years through the pendency of the litigation. It can take years and the state is irreparably harmed by that,” DeSousa said.

Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the plaintiffs, argued that the U.S. Supreme Court for over 150 years has said that immigration law should be regulated by the federal government.

“The interest here is an … inherent, central area of federal control and interest,” Wofsy, who is deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the panel.

Florida’s law is “even more punitive” than federal immigration law, requiring mandatory pretrial detention and longer mandatory sentences, according to Wofsy.

Lagoa noted that states can impose tougher penalties for drug crimes. But Wofsy said that immigration is different.

“Here, we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with US citizens. …. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government,” Wofsy said.

The judges also wrangled over Williams’ contempt order.

Uthmeier has argued that a temporary restraining order — and a longer-lasting preliminary injunction issued later — should only apply to him and local state attorneys because they were the named defendants in the underlying lawsuit.

In an April 23 letter to police agencies, Uthmeier reiterated that position and said he could not prevent police from enforcing the law “where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to Williams’ June 17 contempt ruling.

Lagoa said she thought Williams “erred” when issuing the contempt ruling because Uthmeier’s office doesn’t have direct oversight of sheriffs.

“So how is it appropriate for the district court judge to order the attorney general of Florida to, in essence, supervise these law-enforcement officers?” she asked Wofsy.

But Wofsy said he disagreed with Lagoa’s representation of Williams’ order.

“What the attorney general and every defendant was ordered to do was to give notice of the court’s order. He didn’t have to agree with it. He didn’t have to command them to do anything,” Wofsy said, adding that the contempt issue is the subject of a separate appeal. “The problem with what the attorney general did here is not that he refused to command law enforcement officers, it’s that he told them that there was no lawful legitimate order binding them.”",https://cdn.wmnf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-citizenship-immigration-services-by-Evgenia-Parajanian-via-iStock-1251559190.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 14:57:36.150342

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community.
The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day.
Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer.
At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.","On September 24, a gunman shot at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two immigrants, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, and seriously injuring another, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, who were being detained at the site.

The federal government was quick to blame the attack on the “far left” and the “dehumanization” of ICE agents “who are simply enforcing the law.” Around four hours after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of bullets with the message “anti-ICE” written on them allegedly found at the scene, citing this as evidence of the suspected shooter’s “idealogical [sic] motive.”

But for the immigrant community in Dallas, the shooting is yet another instance of the violence and fear they have endured under President Donald Trump’s nearly $30 billion “deportation-industrial complex” and a continuation of the lack of transparency and accountability from the local and federal governments alike.

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community. At a vigil two days after the shooting, at Parkland Hospital where victims were being treated, Noemi Rios, an organizer with the Chicana-led community initiative Vecinos Unidos DFW, said that local organizations were being flooded with requests seeking more information about the identity of the victims. Rios told reporters that family members who “knew their loved ones had been detained” at the Dallas ICE field office “couldn’t get confirmation of life or death.”

Flaka Martinez, another organizer with Vecinos Unidos, said that this panic was the result of ICE’s detainee locator system, which has been criticized by families of detainees and their lawyers for not providing up-to-date information regarding the whereabouts of detainees. Martinez urged that anyone detained by ICE must have their unique identification numbers (known as an “A-Number”) put into the system within 12 hours of detention. She also pointed to the fact that the facility where the shooting happened was not a detention center but rather an administrative office where people frequently visit for check-ins with ICE. “It’s not sustainable, nor safe to detain people at that facility,” Martinez said.

Well before the shooting, family members with loved ones detained at that Dallas field office reported inhumane conditions in the facility, including overcrowding, medical neglect, and individuals being detained for more than a week without access to running water and air conditioning. Over 600 people were held at the field office in June and July for longer than ICE’s own 12-hour limit on detention in so-called “hold rooms,” according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by El Movimiento DFW, a local group advocating for immigrant rights. Protests and public pressure led in part by Vecinos Unidos and El Movimiento led Democratic Congressmembers Julie Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Jasmine Crockett—who all represent parts of Dallas—to send a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, on July 28 demanding “immediate answers” to reports about the field office. As of October 6, the U.S. representatives have not received a response.

For the immigrant community in Dallas, this lack of transparency around what advocates claim are unlawful and unjust detentions has become an expected response not just from federal law enforcement but local police as well. While the Dallas Police Department (DPD) maintains no official 287(g) agreement with ICE, it has stated that the department “regularly” interacts with federal agencies and will “assist these agencies upon request.”

Tony Rodriguez, the regional commander of the Brown Berets of North Texas, a community defense group that runs an “ICE Watch” in the area, said that the DPD’s public comments are “political double speak.” Rodriguez pointed to a recent multi-agency operation led by Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of ICE, on the Chicas Bonitas Strip Club in Dallas for suspected “human trafficking and unlawful employment.” Rodriguez said that as soon as the Brown Berets’ ICE Watch was alerted of a possible raid, members of the organization were on the scene, collecting testimonials and documenting the arrests.

Corbin Rubinson, spokesperson for DPD, wrote in an email to the Observer that the department was “requested to provide perimeter security during the outside agency’s operation.” According to an ICE press release, federal agents arrested 41 undocumented immigrants; just five had criminal records in the United States.

With suspicion from community organizations already high, Senate Bill 8 could dramatically change how immigration enforcement is conducted in the state. SB 8 will force county sheriffs to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE by next December, which could give deputies the authority to arrest and detain people off the street on the basis of immigration status depending on the 287(g) model a sheriff selects. As the Texas Observer has previously reported, around 30 local county sheriffs and police departments have already voluntarily inked “task force model” agreements, which effectively deputize local officers as ICE agents.

The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day. According to a press release from ICE, DPD arrested Guzman-Fuentes on August 25 on an aggravated assault charge—which ICE said was later dropped—and an outstanding warrant for a DUI. Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer. The press release states that he was being transferred into the office that morning when the shooter opened fire, killing him and García-Hernández, a 32-year-old immigrant from Mexico who passed away due to his injuries five days later.

As previously reported by the San Antonio Express-News, ICE is increasingly using county jails to detain undocumented immigrants before they are taken into federal custody and ultimately deported. While all Texas county jails have been sharing biometric data with ICE since 2010, since January of this year, the number of immigration detainers filed on immigrants booked at the Dallas County Jail has increased by 71 percent. When SB 8 goes into effect, those rates could further increase.

At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.

Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, an Austin immigration attorney who has been in contact with the families of the victims, told the Observer that for families, the loss of their loved ones has been compounded by the “way that the government has responded, by not giving them information quickly.” CBS reported that Guzman-Fuentes’ wife only found out that her husband had been killed after contacting the Salvadoran consulate. Organizers also read a statement from his sister, who said she wants people to remember her brother as “the greatest brother, tío, and friend.” The statement also noted that officials told her that she wouldn’t be able to see her brother’s body and would only be offered two hours for a funeral.

Eric Cedillo, an attorney representing García-Hernández’s wife, told the crowd that he must be remembered for his “heroism.” Cedillo said that when “bullets crashed through the window and hit Miguel,” he turned to the 18 year-old boy sitting next to him in the van and said, “I don’t think I’m going to make it, get underneath me. Let me shield you.”

The number being proposed by the White House is a drastic reduction with advocates warning it would essentially ignore up to 128,000 people who have already been vetted by the United Nations, a U.S. Embassy or an approved international group working with refugees.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the resettlement organization Global Refuge, told the AP this would be “a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy.”

“Not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” he said. “Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group.”

The White House has said the refugee cap is not final until it negotiates a final number with Congress, according to the AP.

A meeting is not expected until the ongoing government shutdown ends.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters have told the AP the Trump administration is “in open defiance of the law.”

“Refugees are being left in limbo,” wrote Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels wrote a letter last week saying, “The consequences are dire, thousands of people are facing persecution abroad who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements are being left to languish while Trump is carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/10/AP25279602424980.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-09 19:56:38.579465

While it was a part of the DOJ’s Civil Division, the CPB oversaw both criminal and affirmative civil enforcement cases and provided expertise to various government-wide working groups, in addition to engaging with consumers, industry, and law enforcement around the world. The CPB also defended certain consumer protection and public health agencies, including the FDA, FTC, and CPSC, in federal district courts.

The Announced Mission of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch

The EALB will focus on (i) bringing affirmative litigation to enforce federal laws and regulations, (ii) enjoining actions that conflict with or violate federal law, (iii) obtaining declaratory judgments, and (iv) seeking monetary penalties where appropriate. The DOJ’s Civil Division is consolidating its affirmative litigation work into one Branch to “hold powerful actors accountable, protect public health and safety, and enforce critical national policies.” The EALB’s announced goals largely overlap with those of its predecessor, but will have an increased focus on advancing the “interests of the United States.”

As stated in the DOJ’s press release, the EALB will (1) prioritize cases that protect women and children from alleged false or misleading medical claims related to gender transition procedures, as well as (2) matters involving “sanctuary” laws and policies that impede federal immigration enforcement. This new focus is consistent with Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate’s memo on Civil Division enforcement and underscores changes in priorities between the current DOJ under the Trump Administration and DOJ under the Biden Administration. Assistant Attorney General Shumate will also be in charge of the newly formed EALB. Since False Claims Act litigation remains a priority, the creation of the EALB should have minimal impact on these matters.

The DOJ’s stated approach aligns with the Civil Division’s recent lawsuits filed against Minnesota, the City of Minneapolis, the City of St. Paul, and others challenging their sanctuary city policies as violating federal immigration enforcement mandates. As alleged in the complaint, the Minnesota officials’ refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities results in the release of dangerous criminals otherwise subject to removal. This lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits targeting sanctuary city policies across the country, including in Boston, New York City, Rochester, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, and Los Angeles.

Responsibilities of The EALB’s Two Sections

There are two sections of the EALB:

Enforcement Section. This section will handle civil enforcement actions and affirmative litigation overseen by the now-dissolved CPB, including enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the Restore Online Shopper’s Confidence Act. Its mission is to protect consumers from harm ranging from deceptive practices by major technology companies, defective goods imported from abroad, false or misleading claims by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Affirmative Litigation Section. This section will bring lawsuits against states, municipalities, and private entities that obstruct or conflict with federal policies, ensuring compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law nationwide. It is anticipated that the Affirmative Litigation section will actively seek declaratory judgments in matters where there is an active controversy between the EALB’s enforcement priorities that conflict with state and local laws.

Key Takeaways

Increased Potential for Disparate Outcomes: The dispersal of CPB personnel and the division of its authority may lead to different outcomes than had the CPB had remained in place.

Review Compliance Programs: Now that the Consumer Protection Branch has been dissolved, company policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure compliance with the announced focus by the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch.

Be Knowledgeable: Information about the new EALB currently is relatively limited due to the recent announcement of its creation coinciding with an ongoing government shutdown. As more information about its priorities, structure, and authority is revealed, clients should keep an eye out for any new developments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.5055_3837.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:58:34.117231

At the same time, Mayor Keith Wilson signaled that he won't capitulate to the administration's demands that the city block off a wide buffer area around the facility or create mandated ""free speech zones"" for protesters.

""You have requested that federal officers be able to ingress and egress from the (ICE) facility without hindrance,"" Wilson's office said in a letter to James Percival, DHS general counsel. ""The Mayor and our local public safety professionals will continue to evaluate the situation on the ground, and they will continue to make public order decisions based on what they believe will be in the best interest of Portland and our community.

""In response to your request for 'Free Speech Zones,' the city of Portland commits to peacefully facilitating free speech throughout the City of Portland.""

In an appearance on FOX News on Tuesday, Noem threatened to flood the city with even more federal law enforcement officers if Wilson didn't meet her demands for ""security measures.""

According to Wilson's office, administration officials required a response to their demands by noon Wednesday. His public statement and letter of response were critical of the administration's demands, but there were still signs Wednesday of the city making course adjustments.

During Noem's visit, Portland police officers had cordoned off the block in front of the ICE facility to keep protesters back. As of Wednesday morning, they were maintaining that cordoned-off area, but all roads have since reopened late Wednesday evening.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said, in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.

A Portland police spokesman said that the agency was keeping the cordon up for the camp removal and because they are ""still providing a presence in the area,"" but that the police tape should come down later in the day; it did come down around 4:30 p.m.

""Ultimately, the encampment near the ICE facility was cleared due to ongoing public safety concerns. Criminal activity has been associated with the site, and the encampment was obstructing public right-of-ways,"" said Mike Benner, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau. ""In addition, the camp has negatively impacted quality of life and economic activity in the area.

""This action was taken to restore public safety, access, and order while balancing the rights of all individuals. PPB remains committed to supporting peaceful protest and the right to free expression, but unlawful behavior and conditions that jeopardize health and safety cannot be allowed to continue. We appreciate the community’s understanding and cooperation.""

Benner said that PPB had requested the camp removal and was there to provide security.

""It’s important to note this camp has moved, been posted, and cleaned numerous times,"" he added.

PPB will continue to monitor events outside the ICE facility, Benner said.

Meanwhile, the Portland Bureau of Transportation was Wednesday morning ""temporarily"" changing South Bond Avenue, which runs north to south through the South Waterfront just east of the ICE facility, from a one-way to a two-way street. PBOT workers were seen drilling yellow line markers over the white lines, which divide the two lanes on the street.

""One-block stretch of South Bond Avenue is now open to two-way traffic between Lowell and Bancroft streets,"" the city said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""Making it easier for people to get to homes and businesses. Initial public input has been very positive in response to this change.""

In his statement Wednesday, Mayor Wilson said that one Trump administration official had raised the possibility of Portland taking over the ICE facility lease, something Wilson said he'd be open to discussing.

The federal government has leased the building from a private owner since 2011, Wilson's office said, when the city issued a conditional land use approval. In September, Portland issued a violation notice due to reports that detainees had been kept at the facility for more than 12 hours, which is not allowed under the terms of that land use approval.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/283f763c-16f7-494d-af61-d60789694b53/20251009T064853/283f763c-16f7-494d-af61-d60789694b53_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:58:18.151045

“So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”","Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to ""delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

The bigger picture

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”

Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that ""due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced ""inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.""

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,"" she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There's that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don't necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients' health are all of these social determinants, like where they're living, how they're getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they're hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that's a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You're basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don't have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,'” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We're supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don't want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce867b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fb2%2Fae9782c44aaa88d6fa904dcfd8ac%2Fwhite-memorial-hospital-6-d25a7003.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 13:57:54.866296

Under Trump's orders, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas are tasked with protecting federal government employees such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and federal property.
Trump's pressure is met with resistance Last month, the Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.
On Wednesday night, hundreds of people marched in downtown Chicago to protest the deployment of the troops and the presence of ICE.","CHICAGO — Eric Harvey is furious about the deployment of the National Guard to Illinois, the city of Chicago, and his neighborhood.

""That's a publicity stunt, man!"" Harvey, who lives in the south side, said.

This summer Chicago's homicide rate was the lowest since the 1960s. So, Harvey can't believe hundreds of troops have arrived in Illinois to make the city any safer. President Trump has called Chicago a ""war zone"" and has claimed the city's crime rate is unsustainable.

Under Trump's orders, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas are tasked with protecting federal government employees such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and federal property.

Harvey said Trump is doing this to appear like he's keeping the city safe from undocumented immigrants. This hits close to home. Harvey lives in a neighborhood that recently had a big ICE raid in a residential building.

""You snatching kids and people that get up and go to work every day — that's who you grab, you not grabbing no criminals,"" Harvey said.

Trump's pressure is met with resistance

Last month, the Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the mission dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz"" has led to more than 1,000 arrests of migrants without legal status.

Chicago residents have taken to the streets to push back. They have recorded — and published — the ICE arrests, and have created ICE watch groups.

On Wednesday night, hundreds of people marched in downtown Chicago to protest the deployment of the troops and the presence of ICE.

Jessica Urbina, 26, came to march by herself because she felt it was important to join her community to repudiate Trump's actions.

""I feel empowered,"" she said. ""I don't know these people, but we all have a lot in common and we all have the same motive to help each other, lean on each other.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told NPR Wednesday his office will do whatever it takes to resist Trump's attacks on his city. He says Congress and the Supreme Court are complicit.

""They're aiding and abetting the dismantling of our democracy and our Constitution,"" Johnson said. ""We'll use every single tool that's available to me. This is going to play out in the courts. It's going to play out on the streets.""

A federal judge in Chicago will hear arguments Thursday afternoon on whether the deployment is legal or not.

It's unclear what exactly Johnson will do. So far, he's used executive orders to make it harder for ICE to operate in the city — including a ban on the use of city-owned or operated space by federal agents.

He said it's the first time a mayor has had to fight off what he calls a federal invasion.

Johnson's defiance has irked Trump, who has called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Johnson for ""failing to protect ICE officers.""

""This is not the first time Trump has accused or insisted on a Black man being arrested,"" Johnson said. ""A president that is threatening to jail his political opponents is clear — yet another example of authoritarianism.""

All of this has caused a lot of fear in the Chicago neighborhoods where many immigrants live. Census data shows about one in five residents in Chicago are foreign born.

Jackson, a Venezuelan immigrant who is only using his first name because of his immigration status, said he's terrified of walking the streets of Chicago with so much federal law enforcement presence.

""And now with the National Guard things will be even more complicated,"" Jackson said in Spanish, his eyes filled with tears. ""It's super scary to even go grocery shopping.""

He has three kids and a wife. 39-year-old Jackson says they have had conversations about what to do if he gets picked up by ICE.

Jackson works in construction, but recently he has not been going to work.

He talked to NPR reporters while waiting at a bus stop right across the street ICE raided last week in a military-style operation. He was en route to meet an attorney to file for asylum.

""I'm trying to show that I'm working, that I have not committed any crimes,"" Jackson said. ""Maybe I'll be given a chance.""

,Human Rights,2025-10-09 15:34:42+00:00,IEEE Spectrum,How an Immigration Raid Complicated America's Push for EV Manufacturing,"Lawrence Ulrich, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://spectrum.ieee.org/hyundai-plant-georgia,"On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about a half hour from Savannah.
Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs.
Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans.
Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.
“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says.","When I visited Hyundai Motor’s “Metaplant” in May to drive the new Ioniq9 electric SUV, the facility was a symbol of everything right about U.S. auto manufacturing. It’s a US $7.6 billion showpiece of automation staffed by gung-ho and highly skilled workers, capable of churning out 500,000 EVs a year at full crank. The biggest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history, the Metaplant is the linchpin of Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s bid to make the state the “electric mobility capital of the country.”

Then it all went wrong. On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about a half hour from Savannah. Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs. Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans. Following a week of detention, and tense negotiations between the South Korean and U.S. governments, the workers were ejected from the U.S. and sent home on a plane chartered by South Korea. Outraged Korean officials opened an investigation into potential human rights abuses during the workers’ incarceration.

“America is not a safe place to work,” one of the workers told The New York Times, after his return home.

Production of the Ioniq 9 and smaller Ioniq 5 has proceeded apace. [Look for my fuller account of the plant, with photos from acclaimed photographer Christopher Payne, in the coming weeks.] But the opening of the battery plant, jointly owned by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, has been pushed back by at least two months. And the episode laid bare some messy contradictions, as America seeks to stand up an EV-and-battery business that can compete against China.

The Trump Administration’s Mixed Messages Confuse Investors

President Trump has demanded that foreign companies build products in the U.S., using tariffs and other strongarm tactics to secure investment pledges. That contrasts with President Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered generous incentives to manufacturers and consumers. The Trump administration has also been nakedly hostile toward EVs and most green initiatives, seeking to reverse Biden’s ambitious pollution and fuel-economy agenda, and deny the ability of California and other states to set their own greenhouse-gas standards. At the administration’s behest, the GOP-led Congress eliminated a $7,500 clean-car tax credit that ended Sept. 30. That tax break had spurred Hyundai to accelerate the Metaplant’s construction to make their EVs eligible for credits, and, over the years, had helped make EVs more affordable for hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the wary dalliance between Trump and manufacturers, there are enough mixed messages to keep a hundred dating apps buzzing.

“The Trump administration was raving about the plant, but then raided it less than two weeks later,” says Betony Jones, who served as senior advisor on labor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Michigan’s former governor, and directed the Department of Energy’s office of energy jobs in the Biden administration. “It’s a confusing situation, and confusing for foreign investors,” she adds.

Trump insisted he did not want to “frighten off” foreign companies or their workers, including presumably the South Koreans—some of whom had helped build car, battery or semiconductor factories around the world, including in Michigan, Texas, Poland, Indonesia and the Middle East.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Responding to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Kush Desai, a White House deputy press secretary, said the President will support any company investing in the U.S. by slashing regulations and enabling them to bring in technical experts to set up facilities and train American workers. “Industry leaders in sectors ranging from autos to pharmaceuticals to technology have committed to investing trillions in the United States because they know they have a friend and ally in the White House,” Desai said.

Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028, a pledge that was further increased to $26 billion in August. The controversial raid comes at a fraught moment for EVs, amid slowing consumer demand and steep tariffs on raw materials and import cars, which have led many automakers to scale back electric plans and lean back into petrol-powered cars and hybrids.

The raid, Jones says, also exposed familiar fault lines in labor and manufacturing. These included ones related to workplace safety and the proper role of foreign workers, and the tendency of foreign manufacturers to locate factories in the southern U.S., where they can operate free of union labor, often at lower wages. A TV station near the Hyundai complex, WTOC, had aired investigative reports about poor safety conditions and unauthorized labor at the plant. At least three workers have died there, according to law enforcement. Hyundai has sought to distance itself from the battery portion of the Metaplant, saying none of the foreign contractors were directly employed by the automaker. Both Hyundai and LG Energy Solution have begun their own inquiries into the raid, and have vowed to follow all laws and rules, including those for workplace safety.

Deportations Renew Attention to Visa Policy

In Georgia, many contract workers had arrived on six-month B-1 visas issued for business travel, or through a visa-waiver program that allows stays of up to 90 days. Some companies, experts say, have played fast-and-loose with visa rules, in part because H-1B visas, which allow six-year stays for employees, are expensive and in short supply. Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.

“Previous U.S. administrations had largely turned a blind eye to” the visa abuses, according to The Guardian.

The Trump administration now faces criticism for its new policy to charge $100,000 for those coveted H-1B visas, which some companies say would be counterproductive, unaffordable and potentially illegal. In Georgia, some local union workers said they had been unfairly bypassed for work in the battery plant.

“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says. “So what does that knowledge-transfer need to look like? How do we pivot from foreign workers and train up a U.S. workforce that has enough specialized skills to do those jobs?”

As General Motors pivoted to EVs, it struggled to scale up battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee, in a joint venture with LG Energy to manufacture a new line of batteries called Ultium Cells. The automaker’s “Factory Zero” in Detroit — where President Biden lauded GM CEO Mary Barra in 2021, and test-drove a GMC Hummer EV in a parking lot — also suffered glitches as GM sought to rush its batteries and EVs into production. That included an incident in which a forklift pierced a stack of robotically-assembled batteries at Factory Zero, starting a fire that shut down production for a day.

The Detroit factory was the American industry’s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line to make pouch-style batteries (which have since been partially supplanted by prismatic cells). GM raced to bring in outside battery consultants and executives to fix battery and assembly issues, finally hiring former Tesla battery chief Kurt Kelty to run its battery operations. It paid off: after those frustrating growing pains, GM began cranking out Ultium batteries, and is now America’s leading producer of lithium-ion cells among automakers.

Jones says that manufacturers, foreign or domestic, are simply crying out for certainty and clear policy directions. “That’s what will attract investment, and that’s where the Trump administration has done irreparable harm,” she says. “The ICE raid is just the cherry on top. How is anybody going to trust us going forward?”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61673725&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C204%2C0%2C205,N,,2025-10-09 13:57:59.220571

Videos of the Sept. 19 incident, which circulated widely Wednesday on social media, showed the Rev. David Black of the First Presbyterian Church being struck in the head by an officer outside an ICE processing facility in a Chicago suburb. It stoked anger toward federal officers who have been deployed to the city by President Trump.

“What this clipped video doesn’t show is that these agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility—impeding operations,” McLaughlin wrote in a lengthy statement on social platform X.

“Over and over again, law enforcement ordered these agitators to move off of federal property so the vehicle could move. Law enforcement verbally warned these agitators that they would use force if they did not move and stop impeding operations. They did not comply,” she added.

McLaughlin accused demonstrators of throwing rocks, bottles and launching fireworks at the law enforcement agents on the roof. However, in the recorded clip, Black could be seen gazing at officers with open hands prior to being shot by a pepper ball.

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service in an interview. “I basically offered an altar call. I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.”

“He was praying to them and they just ended up shooting him. It was like casual to them,” bystander Amanda Tovar told CNN.

“They [demonstrators] weren’t scaling a fence. They weren’t throwing any items. They weren’t even saying anything in the least that would be threatening. And that’s when they [ICE officers] just started opening fire at them,” she added.

Later in the evening, Black was again shoved and sprayed with pepper spray outside the ICE facility in Broadview, a village outside Chicago.

His treatment has been decried by residents and journalists alike who say federal officials have been threatening citizens’ safety and First Amendment rights.

The Chicago News Guild and other news organizations sued DHS and ICE on Monday in connection with allegations of excessive force used on journalists at recent protests in the area.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint states.

Broadview officials have also sued the Trump administration for erecting an 8-foot fence around an ICE processing facility, alleging that the barrier blocks emergency services and patrons from accessing the site and surrounding businesses.

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed.

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

Later Thursday morning, photos and video captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk captured Texas National Guard member on the roof of the facility, identified by a patch on the uniform's right arm.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Local

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

The filings, which cited a declaration signed by Deputy Commanding General for Operations for the United States Army North Command (ARNORTH), Major General Niave Knel, went on to say that Federal Protective Services requested National Guard members to support the protection of federal property in Broadview, and the Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago ""due to two high profile cases"" involving Department of Homeland Security activities.

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

Could courts block National Guard deployment in Chicago? Where things stand

Monday, Illinois filed a lawsuit hoping to block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare the Trump administration's federalization and deployment ""unconstitutional and/or unlawful"" saying it violated the Administrative Procedures Act, a law governing how federal agencies develop and issue regulations, and ""is contrary to the Constitution of the United States.""

A similar deployment was halted by a federal judge in Oregon, as the Trump administration sought to put National Guard members on the ground in Portland.

A hearing is set for 11 a.m. Thursday Central Time.

“We’re looking for the courts to do the right thing,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Wednesday.

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said President Donald Trump ""has exercised his lawful authority.""

The White House has maintained that Trump is trying to keep American cities and federal personnel safe. Trump said this week that if the courts wind up derailing his efforts to use the National Guard, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would empower him to use the U.S. military domestically, NBC News reported.

This week, a judge ordered ICE to dial back arrest tactics in Chicago, coming on the heels of a grand jury refusing to indict a Chicago couple arrested by ICE agents. In a blistering ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings said ICE has been repeatedly violating a court agreement made in 2022 in which the agency agreed to not make warrantless arrests without probable cause.

The court order in which ICE agreed to warrantless arrests with no probable cause was skirted, according to Cummings, by agents carrying blank warrant forms and filling them in on the spot. That practice was also ordered stopped on Tuesday, with Cummings extending “the agreement until February 2, 2026, which corresponds to the number of days between the date that ice unequivocally ceased its compliance.”

But some doubt ICE will follow their own agreed rules.

“Unfortunately, the Trump administration and its agencies have a record of defying court orders. We can't take anything for granted,” Sen. Dick Durbin said. “I think that clearly the President has overstepped his authority, and he is creating a chaotic and dangerous situation in Chicago and in my home state of Illinois. I hope the courts will try to stop him.""

Kernodle granted summary judgment in part for Texas, concluding that CMS’s Final Rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it exceeded CMS’s delegated authority under the Social Security Act.

Background

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program in which the federal government matches state contributions for medical care provided to low-income individuals. While states may impose health-care provider taxes to raise their share of Medicaid funding, those taxes cannot include a “hold harmless” provision that guarantees providers a reimbursement equal to their tax burden. This safeguard was enacted by Congress in 1991 after states developed financing mechanisms that maximized federal matching funds without additional state contributions.

Texas operates a Medicaid financing mechanism through Local Provider Participation Funds (LPPFs), which collect mandatory payments from hospitals to help finance the non-federal share of Medicaid supplemental payments. In 2023, CMS issued a Bulletin that sought to expand the interpretation of what constitutes a prohibited “hold harmless” arrangement under the Social Security Act to also include guarantees by private parties in private agreements (2023 Bulletin). In Texas v. Brooks-LaSure, 680 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Tex. 2023), Texas challenged that 2023 Bulletin, and the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction, holding that the 2023 Bulletin violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding CMS’s statutory authority under the Social Security Act.

Despite that ruling, CMS proceeded in 2024 to publish a Final Rule and new Bulletin (2024 Final Rule and Bulletin) that largely adopted the same interpretation as the 2023 Bulletin previously rejected by the Court. The 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin implemented changes to 42 C.F.R. § 433.6, including expanding the “hold harmless” definition to cover private arrangements, and 42 C.F.R. § 430.3, requiring appeals of CMS disapprovals for State directed payments to be filed with the Departmental Appeals Board. Texas amended its complaint to challenge the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin on the same grounds raised in Texas’s challenge to 2023 Bulletin, arguing that CMS’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority under the Social Security Act. Texas requested the Court convert its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction to preclude CMS’s enforcement of the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin.

The Court’s Decision

Similar to the Court’s previous decision regarding the 2023 Bulletin, the Court concluded that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court held that “the Final Rule and the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins exceed CMS’s statutory authority by expanding the meaning of ‘hold-harmless provision’ to include guarantees by private parties in private agreements and by attempting to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over certain disputes.” The Court explained that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin attempted to broaden the definition of “hold harmless” in a manner inconsistent with the statutory text.

The Court also distinguished CMS’s current interpretation from prior regulations, concluding that the agency had attempted to impose new obligations without proper statutory basis. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed its prior 2023 injunction analysis, again citing Fifth Circuit precedent that CMS may not “rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.”

As a result, the Court vacated 42 C.F.R §§ 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(G), 42 C.F.R § 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(H), and 42 C.F.R § 430.3(e), along with the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins, and enjoined CMS from enforcing the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin. By striking down CMS’s expanded interpretation of the “hold harmless” provision, the Court preserves Texas’s current Medicaid financing structure through LPPFs.

Ochab",,,,,https://www.lemkininstitute.com/single-post/un-experts-concerned-about-mass-forced-returns-of-afghan-nationals,"More than 300,000 people have returned from Pakistan and over a 1.5 million from Iran, including 410,000 who have been deported from Iran since June 24.
Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation.
Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more.
The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population.
No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.” The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement.","On July 18, 2025, several United Nations experts, including Richard Bennett, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Mai Sato, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Gehad Madi, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and Paula Gaviria Betancur, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, published a statement condemning ongoing deportations and mass forced returns of Afghan nationals from Iran and Pakistan, and other countries. As the statement indicated, “More than 1.9 million Afghans have returned or been forced to return to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan so far in 2025. More than 300,000 people have returned from Pakistan and over a 1.5 million from Iran, including 410,000 who have been deported from Iran since June 24. Thousands of the returnees are unaccompanied children. Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation. Security-related discourse has intensified anti-Afghan sentiment.” As the statement added, “Returns must be halted immediately. Afghanistan is not a safe country for returnees, given the constantly deteriorating human rights situation since the Taliban seized control, nearly four years ago.”

In August 2025, it will be four years since the Taliban took over power (on August 15, 2021). What followed the takeover can only be described as a total reversal of the progress made in the country during the twenty years of the Afghan Republic, and the return of terror. Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more. Women and girls are systematically deprived of their fundamental rights to the point that they are effectively confined to the four walls of their homes. Former security and government officials, including judges and prosecutors, those critical of Taliban policies, such as human rights defenders and journalists, as well as religious and ethnic minorities are at particular risk of reprisals and serious harms in the country, and even more so - if they are returned.

With every decision taken so far, the de facto authorities in Afghanistan ensure that there is no human rights and no viable opposition to the Taliban - so that their reign could continue without even the slightest criticism. The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population. Among others, in April 2025, four men had been publicly executed as part of the Taliban’s Qisas (retribution in kind –in reference to religious law) - bringing the total number of reported public executions carried out since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 to at least 10. Furthermore, the Taliban has been using corporal punishment, mostly lashings, often for such acts as sodomy, running away from home, and “illicit relationships.” The U.N. reported at least 213 such punishments (169 males and 44 females) since the beginning of 2025.

Afghanistan is not a safe country, and Russia formally recognizing the Taliban as Afghanistan’s government will not change this. As the U.N. experts emphasized, “Those forced to return have genuine fears for their safety and security and face very real risks of persecution, threats, and violent reprisals. No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.”

The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement. Furthermore, as the U.N. experts warned, “States, due to the sheer quantity and forceful nature of returns, cannot ensure that Afghan nationals have access to fair procedures where their individual protection needs are fully assessed. Many Afghans have experienced discrimination, mistreatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, raising serious concerns under international refugee and human rights law.”

The dire situation in Afghanistan calls for an increased humanitarian response for Afghanistan and host countries to address the international protection needs - not the opposite as recently seen. As the world is dealing with one of the worst refugee crisis in years, as exacerbated with every new conflict and situation of concerns, we cannot abandon the rules-based order designed to ensure humane responses to such situations.
