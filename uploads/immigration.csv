Shabana Mahmood is expected to set out plans to deter migrants from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport those who do, in a statement to MPs on Monday.

She is understood to have based some of the changes on the approach in Denmark, having dispatched officials there last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Mahmood is also expected to be preparing changes to human rights legislation to make it easier to deport people who cross the Channel in small boats.

Changes would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country, the Telegraph reported.

Home Office officials described Mahmood’s plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.

The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.

Mahmood said: “Nearly 50,000 illegal migrants have been removed or deported since the election. We’ve ramped up enforcement, deported foreign criminals from our streets, and saved taxpayers millions.

“I pledge today to scale up the removal and deportations of illegal migrants and do whatever it takes to secure our borders.”

The government has also sent about 100 people back to France under the “one in, one out” returns deal for those who cross the Channel in small boats.

But, despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a major political headache for the government.

So far, 39,075 people have made the journey this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures.

The figure is up 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than the equivalent point in 2022, the peak year for crossings.

On Monday, the Home Office confirmed a second man had re-entered the UK by small boat having been returned to France under the “one in, one out” deal.

The government said he would be deported back to France shortly and insisted his immediate detection and detention showed the system was working.

Denmark’s tighter rules on family reunions and restricting some refugees to a temporary stay are among the policies being looked at.

Some research has suggested that deterrence policies have little impact on asylum seekers’ choice of destination, but a 2017 study said Denmark’s “negative nation branding” had proved effective in limiting asylum applications.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e51f0bd9f6224f4ddc40a2200eeed4a471d2fd/421_0_1773_1418/master/1773.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=921c8df64924cee74ecf9758cadb19fe",N,,2025-11-14 07:56:19.142023

“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said.
For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations.

The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently.","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel met with migrant advocates in Grand Rapids at a Thursday roundtable to discuss the impacts of federal policy under the Trump administration on their ability to do their work, especially around concerns of immigration detention and deportation.

Migrant Legal Aid, which hosted the roundtable, as well as Puertas Abiertas, a Grand Rapids-based organization focused on helping Latinx victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, described situations where federal enforcement had in the past been helpful or necessary to help victims of trafficking or exploitation, but now came with a high risk of detention or deportation for those very victims.

“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said.

For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations.

“In fact, it’s been the opposite, to the point where, in Michigan, if a grower is being investigated by us, they will call DOL to get an inspection, which is basically a whitewash, to say, look, they can’t find anything,” Hendricks said.

That’s also a question of an ability to engender trust in workers regardless of immigration status, Hendricks said, which called the organization’s “secret little superpower.”

Meanwhile, Alejandra Garces Pozo, a farmworker outreach specialist with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that she has had many people reach out to her to cancel their benefits, including Medicaid or food assistance, because of fears that the Department of Homeland Security could be accessing their data.

“We’re seeing the struggles and the changes in our programs, in our departments, like with helping people apply for state benefits, like whether it’s Medicaid or food assistance or childcare or state emergency relief,” Pozo said. “I’ve had a lot of clients call me so stressed to the point where by the time I’m like, ‘What is it that you want me to do?’ She’s like, ‘I want you to take my benefits away. I don’t want benefits anymore’.”

Those data sharing concerns have been the target of a number of suits joined by Nessel’s office, as she noted in the roundtable, including injunctions on data sharing with Homeland Security regarding SNAP food assistance benefits and Medicaid.

“I know why people are scared and don’t feel safe and don’t want to participate in programs that they are eligible under law to participate in need and need and badly need,” Nessel responded.

She added that her own concerns about data privacy under the Trump administration, especially tax return data from the IRS, led her to actually stop hosting trainings with senior citizens on protecting their personal information.

“How am I now trying to tell people how to protect their Social Security number when I don’t even know who has their Social Security number?” she said.

That lack of ability to work with federal agencies has also impacted Nessel’s own work, she explained. Her office will work on a case involving something as serious as sex trafficking, but when the FBI or Homeland Security get involved, they often instead detain and try to deport the victims.

“It’s very, very difficult to be a state attorney general, working with the locals, working with the county, working with MSP (Michigan State Police). We just have a really difficult time doing this work when we don’t have the federal agencies involved,” Nessel said, adding that some powers, like granting visas to victims, are outside of her power. “The trust is not there that they’ll treat people who are victims like victims instead of like criminals.”

“Our clients are in so much fear of even calling law enforcement just because of the situation that is going on with Homeland Security,” added Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas. “They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.”

Claudia Annoni, the executive director of Puertas Abiertas, also noted that threats of immigration enforcement are often weaponized against victims of domestic violence or trafficking.

“It adds also to the level of intimidation, because if the perpetrator is a legal citizen here in the United States and you’re not, that is an easy one,” she said. “You say something, and I’ll call immigration on you.”

Nessel responded to Centeno to note that that hesitancy makes it harder to identify victims or witnesses to crimes. She also added that masked and unmarked law enforcement vehicles or uniforms make it hard for people to tell if they’re being stopped by actual police or immigration agents, as opposed to people posing as them.

“It’s really damaging for all of law enforcement,” she said. “It’s creating that confusion in the communities.”

Another concern raised at the roundtable was the availability of grant funding, and how challenging new rules regarding diverse or inclusive language have created new challenges for groups like Puertas Abiertas to even function.

“The reality is … we serve this community. And when you’re applying for a grant or you’re applying to a foundation, you aren’t gonna lie, ‘Well, we serve people.’ We serve the Latinx community,” Annoni said. “Who do we trust that we can send a letter, a proposal to receive funding.”

Molly Spaak, deputy director and attorney at Migrant Legal Aid, said that their organization had gone through a thesaurus to find different language to use when their $300,000 federal grant was cut — over half of their annual budget.

The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently. That falls outside of their normal scope of work, and means that they often have to direct people to outside, private lawyers — who are often very expensive.

“I think a key takeaway is that all of this happens so quickly and it’s so confusing, and our clients are usually terrified by this whole experience,” Spaak said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_2994-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 07:56:22.477850

Inhumane Treatment on Deportation Flights The enormous growth in flights is not the only concern.","Human Rights First just released its latest ICE Flight Monitor report tracking deportation flights through October 2025. This project was originally started by Tom Cartwright over five years ago, and when Human Rights First absorbed it earlier this year, they took on one of the most important immigration data projects in our research ecosystem right now.

Under the current Trump administration’s aggressive deportation agenda, this data is an essential window into this otherwise largely invisible architecture of lawlessness, violence, and forced repatriation. We’re spending enormous amounts of public money on this part of the system, from $7,000 to $26,000 per flight hour according to the report, and yet it appears that many of these deportations may actually violate national or international law, let alone are conducted in fundamentally inhumane ways.

I want to share some of the main findings and my own key observations with you here as a way of encouraging you to learn more about this project. You can also sign up to get new monthly reports as they come available from Human Rights First.

ICE Flight Tracker: Start with the Basics

Let’s start with the basics of the data we’re looking at. The ICE Flight Monitor tracks three types of immigration enforcement flights.

First are deportation flights that remove people from the U.S. to other countries. These include “third country” transfers, where the Trump administration is sending people to countries they’re not even citizens of, a tactic that’s both punitive and possibly illegal in many cases.

Second are domestic transfer flights, or “shuffle” flights, that move people between detention centers within the United States. These aren’t just about logistics. Transfers are a way for ICE to limit access to immigration attorneys, displace and confuse people in detention so they don’t even know where they are, and keep detainees compliant so they don’t speak up about their rights.

Third are removal-related flights that support the deportation apparatus but aren’t dedicated deportation or transfer flights, like when carriers move between hubs to set up for other operations.

These differences are important when trying to making sense of the data in the flight tracker, because, to be honest, it can get a bit overwhelming if you don’t hav a framework for conceptualizing this work first.

Records Numbers of Flights to Record Numbers of Countries

Like pretty much all enforcement metrics under this administration, the numbers are all record-breaking. Overall, the ICE Flight Monitor has documented over 10,672 total flights during the Trump administration so far. Most are those interior shuffle flights, but deportation flights are also well above previous highs. October alone saw a record 1,014 domestic shuffle flights—the highest on record—plus 199 deportation flights, which is above, but not quite as dramatically above, historic levels.

Altogether, the Trump administration has conducted 4,183 deportation and deportation-related flights since January. That more than the number conducted in FY 2024 (with three more months), when 3,483 deportation and deportation-related flights were conducted.

I would say that the deportation flights specifically are higher but not dramatically higher than the Biden administration. Where we really see the most dramatic increase is flights between detention facilities, which corresponds to the massive growth in that infrastructure. I still don’t think the Trump administration’s astronomical claims about deportation numbers are matching up to reality, but we are certainly seeing an increase in deportation flights overall.

The data on shuffle flights is a powerful compliment to my work on detention data and shows why we need multiple projects and partners working in tandem to understand the full scope and impact of the detention system. You can’t understand detention without understanding how people are being shuffled around the country, often deliberately to make it harder for them to access legal help. This is on top of locating detention centers in rural areas, which makes medical services, legal services, and contact with family members all much more difficult.

The geographic reach is also unprecedented, and reflects the deeper fact that the US deportation apparatus is a global apparatus, not just a national one. From January through October, the administration conducted removal flights to 77 countries—a 79 percent increase over the same period in 2024. That includes 24 countries that had never received ICE flights since tracking began in 2020, like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan, and Rwanda.

Inhumane Treatment on Deportation Flights

The enormous growth in flights is not the only concern. ICE’s practice of dehumanizing treatment and disregard for basic dignity extends to the treatment of people on these flights.

People on these flights are often restrained with handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons for the entire journey, even when they pose no apparent security threat. Even worse is ICE’s use of something called the WRAP—a full-body restraint suit that prevents people from moving their arms or shifting position. Medical experts warn it can cause severe physical and psychological distress. According to the report, it’s been used as punishment when people ask to speak with their attorney or express fear of deportation. One man who was bound from shoulders to feet on a September military flight to Ghana reported lasting trauma and a leg injury that left him with a limp.

Flight attendants have reported that emergency procedures provide little guidance for evacuating restrained passengers. Some crew members say pilots told them during briefings that evacuating detained individuals in an emergency wasn’t even a priority.

And here’s the thing that should get more attention: many people on these flights don’t even have deportation orders. They may not have had their full day in court but are being deported anyway. Many people on these planes could be refugees or asylum seekers who might have qualified for protection if they’d been allowed to complete the legal process. I’ve written before that asylum grant rates are really low, so, sure, the changes are slimmer than ever, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay.

The Human Work Behind this Crucial Data

I want to say something about how this research actually happens, because when reports look this clean and polished, people assume it’s just numbers scraped off a website or obtained through some records request. The reality is much messier and more human, as anyone who actually does this work can attest.

I remember sitting down with Tom when he was looking for a home for this project. He walked me through how he does this work, and it’s incredibly impressive. It’s not just some grand automation project where you push a button and you get data back. It’s about really understanding how international flight tracking systems work, what different tracking platforms offer, how the government is trying to hide data about these flights, and developing deep knowledge about flight tracking around the entire world.

As I try to tell my students, the line between quantitative and qualitative research isn’t as bright as people think. There’s no data-driven research in the immigration space that isn’t also deeply qualitative, relying on subjective analytical decisions and specialized knowledge, not just algorithms and formulas. And this project profoundly illustrates that.

I’m grateful to everyone at Human Rights First for taking it on and ensuring it continues. Please read the full report below.

All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.

President Donald Trump signed the legislation Wednesday, just hours after the House passed it. The Senate had passed it Monday.

WATCH: House passes bill to end longest government shutdown in history

Here’s a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:

What led to the shutdown

Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden’s big energy and health care bill, and it’s set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.

WATCH: Breaking down the deal to reopen the government and what comes next

“Never have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double — double in the blink of an eye,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first.

“Republicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.

Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.

READ MORE: What’s in the Senate shutdown deal

Thune’s position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. “Open up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,” Schumer said then.

Democratic leaders under pressure

The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration’s deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don’t align with the administration’s priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.

Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump’s efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump’s big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.

The Democrats’ struggles to blunt the Trump administration’s priorities has prompted calls for the party’s congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.

WATCH: ‘We needed to change the equation,’ Sen. Kaine says on his vote to end shutdown

Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.

This time around, Schumer demanded that Republicans negotiate with Democrats to get their votes on a spending bill. The Senate rules, he noted, requires bipartisan support to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance a spending bill.

But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party’s left flank when he refused to go along.

WATCH: Trump ‘likely to be emboldened’ by 8 Democrats voting to end shutdown, Sen. Murphy says

“The Senate Democrats are afraid that the radicals in their party will say that they caved,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at one of his many daily press conferences.

The blame game

The political stakes in the shutdown are huge, which is why leaders in both parties have held nearly daily press briefings to shape public opinion.

Roughly 6 in 10 Americans say Trump and Republicans in Congress have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a “moderate” share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.

Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a “big factor, negative” for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP’s stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.

Damage of the shutdown

The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.

Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.

“This dysfunction is damaging enough to our constituents and economy here at home, but it also sends a dangerous message to the watching world,” said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan. “It demonstrates to our allies that we are an unreliable partner, and it signals to our adversaries that we can’t work together to meet even the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-11-13T124813Z_1740400751_RC2NVHAV985B_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHUTDOWN-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 06:57:53.786103

Barnes, www.nytimes.com, charlie-savage, julian-e-barnes",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/politics/boat-strikes-doj-memo-trump.html,"The Trump administration has insisted that its boat strikes are lawful.
The Trump administration itself did that a few months ago at Mr. Trump’s direction.
Applying that label to ordinary drug cartels and criminal gangs was unprecedented and contested, since terrorists are ideologically or religiously motivated violent groups like Al Qaeda.
By that standard, the E.L.N., which was designated a terrorist group in 1997, qualifies, but groups that are traditionally understood as drug cartels do not.
But he criticized the proposition that there was an actual armed conflict with the cartels to start.","A secret Justice Department memo blessing President Trump’s boat strikes as lawful hangs on the idea that the United States and its allies are legally in a state of armed conflict with drug cartels, a premise that derives heavily from assertions that the White House itself has put forward, according to people who have read it.

The memo from the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which is said to be more than 40 pages long, signed off on a military campaign that has now killed 80 people in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. It said such extrajudicial killings of people suspected of running drugs were lawful as a matter of Mr. Trump’s wartime powers.

In reaching that conclusion, the memo contradicts a broad range of critics, who have rejected the idea that there is any armed conflict and have accused Mr. Trump of illegally ordering the military to commit murders.

The administration has insisted that Mr. Trump has the authority to lawfully order the strikes under the laws of war, but it has provided scant public details about its legal analysis to buttress that conclusion. The accounts of the memo offer a window into how executive branch lawyers signed off on Mr. Trump’s desired course of action, including appearing to have accepted at face value the White House’s version of reality.

The memo, which was completed in late summer, is said to open with a lengthy recitation of claims submitted by the White House, including that drug cartels are intentionally trying to kill Americans and destabilize the Western Hemisphere. The groups are presented not as unscrupulous businesses trying to profit from drug trafficking, but as terrorists who sell narcotics as a means of financing violence.

Based on such claims, the memo states that Mr. Trump has legitimate authority to determine that the United States and its allies are legally in a formal state of armed conflict with “narco-terrorist” drug cartels, according to the people who have read the document. The rest of the memo’s reasoning is based on that premise.

For example, the people said, the memo asserts that boats believed to be carrying narcotics are lawful military targets because their cargo would otherwise generate revenue that cartels could use to buy military equipment to wage the purported armed conflict.

And a lengthy section at the end of the memo, they said, offers potential legal defenses if a prosecutor were to charge administration officials or troops for involvement in the killings. Everyone in the chain of command who follows orders that comply with the laws of war has battlefield immunity, the memo says, because it is an armed conflict.

Since Sept. 2, the U.S. military has attacked 20 boats, either in the Caribbean Sea or the eastern Pacific Ocean, that the administration has said were smuggling narcotics. In announcing the strikes, the administration has cited intelligence but has not put forward specific evidence.

The Trump administration has insisted that its boat strikes are lawful. In September, it told Congress that Mr. Trump had “determined” that the United States was in a noninternational armed conflict, meaning in a war against a nonstate actor, like drug cartels, and that the people it was killing aboard the boats were “combatants.”

Outside specialists in laws governing lethal force have widely criticized that argument, and the administration has not offered a detailed public explanation of the legal analysis supporting its assertion. The omissions have included how it bridged the conceptual gap between drug trafficking and associated crimes, as serious as they are, and the kind of armed attacks that is necessary to create a state of war.

The administration has, however, disclosed that an Office of Legal Counsel memorandum signed off on the operation. And while it has not made the memo public, it has started to let members of Congress and their staff read copies, while providing T. Elliot Gaiser, who leads the office, to answer questions at some briefings.

The memo is said to be framed around a question posed by the White House: whether limited lethal force could be used to stop vessels in international waters that are not registered to any country, in order to curb the flow of narcotics from drug cartels designated as terrorist groups.

In endorsing Mr. Trump’s determination that there is an armed conflict, the memo accepted the White House’s assertions uncritically, according to the people who have read it.

For example, they said, the memo cites the White House’s claim that cartels are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans a year. But it does not address the fact that a surge in overdoses over the past decade was caused by fentanyl, which comes from labs in Mexico controlled by Mexican cartels, not by South American cocaine.

The memo also cites violence by drug cartels against the security forces of other governments in the region, like Colombia’s and Mexico’s, and asserts that the United States can attack the cartels as a matter of collective self-defense, the people who have seen the memo said. But it does not address whether any foreign government has requested the United States to defend it by carrying out military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea or eastern Pacific Ocean.

Colombia is fighting a Marxist rebel group known as the National Liberation Army, or E.L.N., which traffics in drugs to finance its purchases of weapons but is not traditionally considered a drug cartel. One of the 20 strikes to date, announced on Oct. 19, targeted a boat that the Trump administration said was carrying a shipment linked to E.L.N. But Colombia’s president has demanded that the United States stop striking boats, calling them murders.

The memo is said to treat as significant the fact that the U.S. government has designated a range of Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The Trump administration itself did that a few months ago at Mr. Trump’s direction.

Applying that label to ordinary drug cartels and criminal gangs was unprecedented and contested, since terrorists are ideologically or religiously motivated violent groups like Al Qaeda. By that standard, the E.L.N., which was designated a terrorist group in 1997, qualifies, but groups that are traditionally understood as drug cartels do not.

The memo’s framing of the boat strikes as a specific effort to destroy the cargos has a different emphasis from the messaging the administration has used to justify the attacks.

The strikes have been widely condemned as murders or a war crime, because even criminal suspects are considered to be civilians, and a military may not deliberately target them if they pose no immediate threat. The United States has traditionally dealt with maritime drug smuggling by intercepting boats and arresting the people on board if a search reveals illicit cargo.

Responding to such criticism, Mr. Trump and members of his administration, like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have declared that the people crewing the boats are “narco-terrorists” and the Trump administration has called them “combatants.”

The memo, however, is said to focus instead on the purported shipments of narcotics aboard, portraying those as the specific targets of the strikes based on the theory that their sale would generate revenue that cartels would use to finance their alleged war efforts.

Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer and specialist in the laws of war who has been critical of the Trump administration’s operation, said there was some historical practice for citing international law to justify attacks on things that an enemy uses to fund its wartime combat activities. He pointed to strikes on oil facilities run by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and on Taliban-linked drug operations in Afghanistan.

But he criticized the proposition that there was an actual armed conflict with the cartels to start. Regardless, he added, he was skeptical that the specific loads of drugs being hit could meet international law standards for being legitimate military targets, arguing that their connection to any specific military activity seemed attenuated.

“It would be difficult to establish that the cargo on these vessels was a military objective under the law of war because there is no obvious connection between a shipment of drugs and military action by these supposed groups,” he said. “By contrast, ISIS was paying actual fighters in a real armed conflict with the proceeds of its oil sales.”

Another part of the memo, the people said, addresses the lack of congressional authorization for the operation.

The memo, they said, asserts that Mr. Trump has constitutional authority, as commander in chief, to order strikes on his own because he has determined they would be in the national interest and because their anticipated nature, scope and duration would fall short of a “war” in the constitutional sense.

Despite concluding that an armed conflict is underway, the memo also says the operation is not covered by the War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law that requires presidents to terminate deployments of troops into “hostilities” after 60 days if Congress has not authorized them. This part of its reasoning, which has been previously reported, turns on the idea that airstrikes that do not put U.S. personnel in danger should not be interpreted as “hostilities.”

The final section, discussing arguments that could be raised in case of any future prosecutions, is said to be lengthy, broaching, among others, the idea that U.S. personnel have immunity for killing enemy fighters in an armed conflict.

Citing a need to protect society from dangerous narco-terrorist cartels, the memo compares military personnel participating in the strikes to the police who break the speed limits when pursuing a suspect who poses a threat to public safety. Those officers are not considered to have committed a crime.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/multimedia/13dc-memo-lcfw/13dc-memo-lcfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 06:57:58.123764

Anonymous researchers obtained Flock ALPR audit data through a public records request to the police department in Danville, Illinois.
This information was likewise discovered through a public records request of Flock audit data.
The UW report built on this previous work with its researchers filing public records requests with law enforcement agencies across Washington state.
“The first question is whether or not you actually ran an audit report that meets the criteria identified by the requestor,” Thompson wrote.","An October surveillance report has been creating waves in law enforcement agencies using automatic license plate readers (ALPRs) in Washington state, including Lynnwood, Redmond, and Stanwood.

Law enforcement agencies across the state have been purchasing Flock Safety ALPRs, which the company claims will “stop crime in its tracks.” The University of Washington’s (UW) Center for Human Rights’ report highlighted Flock Safety surveillance data being exposed by local law enforcement agencies in order to assist in federal immigration enforcement.

In May, 404 Media originally broke the news that Flock’s data was being shared with federal agencies including the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement purposes. Anonymous researchers obtained Flock ALPR audit data through a public records request to the police department in Danville, Illinois.

In June, The Urbanist reported that the King County Housing Authority’s (KCHA) Flock camera data had been shared with law enforcement agencies across the country. KCHA’s data appeared to have been used in immigration enforcement searches, as well as in a search for someone who had sought an abortion. This information was likewise discovered through a public records request of Flock audit data.

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) wrote a letter to Flock stating he’d learned Flock had run a pilot earlier in 2025 that gave data access to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) (which includes ICE), the Secret Service, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service without properly informing its law enforcement and other clients.

Wyden has also written a letter requesting the Federal Trade Commission investigate Flock for possible negligent cybersecurity practices.

The UW report built on this previous work with its researchers filing public records requests with law enforcement agencies across Washington state. Records showed at least eight agencies enabled direct sharing with U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) and at least 10 agencies had “back door” access available to USBP. Researchers also found limited instances of “side door” access with officers across the nation performing searches on USBP’s behalf.

“This report further confirms that Flock ALPR is ripe for abuse that leads to real harm for the most vulnerable among us, including immigrants,” Electronic Frontier Foundation Senior Policy Analyst Matthew Guariglia said. “Flock provides a constant, warrantless digital dragnet that sweeps up everyone who passes in front of its cameras whether they’re suspected of any crime or not, and in increasingly authoritarian times, that’s a real danger to our freedoms.”

Washington State has no laws regulating the use of ALPR technology. Even states that have such laws have found they are not a panacea. California prohibits state agencies from sharing ALPR data with out-of-state and federal agencies, but agencies all over the state have broken this law.

“For me, the shocking finding of our report was not so much just that Border Control had access to systems, because that’s what others had reported and we thought we were going to find, but it was that all these agencies said they didn’t realize either that they were directly sharing with Border Patrol or that Border Patrol was able to access their networks through the national lookup feature in Flock,” said Phil Neff, Research Coordinator for the UW Center for Human Rights. “So the fact that these agencies didn’t even have awareness of the full scope of the systems that they were employing is concerning.”

Local agencies pause use of Flock

In the wake of the UW report, several local cities have moved to pause their use of Flock ALPRs.

Lynnwood City Council approved their Flock cameras in a two-year agreement in January. Following the release of UW’s report in October, Lynnwood Police Department disabled all system access and turned off the cameras. Some residents would like the contract to be canceled altogether.

The KCHA told The Urbanist they have discontinued their pilot trial of Flock cameras, which were installed at 5 of their 95 subsidized properties. The cameras were deactivated in mid-September.

The Redmond Police Department suspended their use of their Flock cameras as of November 5, after a council vote earlier in the week and several ICE arrests made in the city. The city council plans to review the ALPR program’s governance before making a decision about how to move forward. Further council discussions are planned for November 12 and 18, with the opportunity for public comment on November 18.

“The real-world harms caused by mass surveillance systems like Flock are not merely hypothetical; the repercussions of the abuse of this sensitive data are being seen in the news around the country on a weekly basis,” local anti-surveillance group DeFlock Redmond told The Urbanist. “The recent questioning by Redmond City Council Members (based on concerns raised from the community) were very encouraging and their request for this suspension was a welcome first step. It showed us that they are listening and willing to take action to protect the community from the many threats this dragnet exposes us to. We remain optimistic in asking that the council does the right thing and cancels this contract outright.”

While some cities pull back from their Flock surveillance programs, others remain committed. Just last month, Federal Way voted to expand their use of Flock ALPRs by buying two new cameras.

Meanwhile, some cities have been waiting for the resolution of a lawsuit to make up their minds.

Public Records Act case

In June, the city of Stanwood received a public records request for all ALPR camera footage during a one-hour time window on a specific date. Unlike red-light cameras, ALPR camera footage shows the faces and license plates of all the drivers who pass by as opposed to being limited to people who are suspected of a crime.

In response to the request, the cities of Stanwood and Sedro-Wooley filed a motion asking for Flock camera footage to either not be public record or be exempt from the Public Records Act for privacy reasons. State law already exempts red-light camera data from public records.

While waiting for a ruling, Stanwood and Sedro-Wooley paused their ALPR programs. Woodway delayed its vote on whether to enter into a contract with Flock, and Mountlake Terrace delayed installation of its Flock cameras.

Last week, Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski of Skagit County Superior Court ruled that images captured by Flock ALPR cameras are public records and must be disclosed.

However, the case didn’t address the issue of whether the ALPR audits are public records, which is pertinent since some local agencies are denying public records requests for the audits.

The Urbanist has obtained attorney-client privileged communications accidentally released and decoded from a public records request made by Rose Terse to the City of Prosser. These communications include an email sent to a records division employee of the City of Prosser from Nikki Thompson, a partner at Thompson, Guildner & Associates, Inc., P.S., which is the law firm that handled Stanwood and Sedro-Wooley’s case.

“The first question is whether or not you actually ran an audit report that meets the criteria identified by the requestor,” Thompson wrote. “If you did not, you do not have an obligation to create a record in response to a request. If you did run the audit reports before the request date, the general consensus among city attorneys is that the external audit report contains information that does not belong to us. Most cities are denying the request for external audits. The internal audits are somewhat different.”

The external audit report is the type of audit that shows if out-of-state and federal agencies, including ICE, have accessed the ALPR data. This legal opinion both discourages agencies from running the audits in the first place, preventing them from pro-actively discovering any issues, and tries to limit the transparency these audits can provide the public.

Each municipality is creating its own policies around whether it will release the audit reports via public records request, a trend that is likely to continue until the issue is brought to the question via a lawsuit.

The landscape ahead

Trying to provide accountability and transparency around these surveillance tools going forward will be a challenging endeavor.

“We need access to audits that frankly go beyond what Flock provides you,” Neff said. “And I think it goes back to just a fundamental question of civilian oversight, of law enforcement in particular, and public oversight, which I think becomes more challenging, but also more necessary, when the reach of the technology that they have access to is so broad.”

While the Flock audit reports have shown widespread sharing of Flock ALPR data with out-of-state and federal agencies such as ICE, there’s no guarantee the audits will continue to provide a window of transparency for the public.

Not only are cities refusing to fulfill public record requests, but Flock Safety itself has changed its policies. In the summer, the company introduced what it first called “a proactive search term tool” and later a “keyword filter” that can block attempts to search for terms related to immigration enforcement, for example. However, agencies who want to avoid the controversy can simply be vague or dishonest when filling in the “reason” column that is preserved in these audits.

At the end of October, Flock made a few new changes. It added a “mandatory offense type selection” from a drop-down menu that must be selected before any search is performed, which seems fairly simple to circumvent. More alarmingly, agencies can now choose to remove all search reasons from their public search audits.

“While Flock’s audit logs have been successful in bringing to light certain abuses, that very fact is likely to deter many officers from honestly describing the purposes of their searches moving forward,” wrote Jay Stanley, Senior Policy Analyst at the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “The bottom line is that the public simply can’t count on these kinds of logs to be a reliable check against the enormous power that its mass surveillance system is placing in the hands of law enforcement.”

Right now, there isn’t an obvious plan in place to provide that reliable check. As case law begins to accumulate, the Washington State Legislature might also choose to intervene, although as the example of California illustrates, that path is not without its own pitfalls.

Of course, individual municipalities and agencies can always choose to discontinue surveillance programs that don’t match their values.

“We’re seeing locally, you can turn [surveillance technologies] off, so we don’t have to go necessarily that direction of just subjecting ourselves to increasing surveillance at all times,” said Neff. “We can make decisions about what kinds of technology are appropriate, but that requires us to have access to tools of transparency and democracy.”",https://www.theurbanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1280px-ARH_TrafficSpot_Gantry_Data_Point_Front.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 03:57:28.439700

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump. The justice department’s intervention in the case sets up a high-profile showdown between the Trump administration and Newsom, one of the president’s chief antagonists and a possible 2028 contender.

“California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” said Pam Bondi, the US attorney general. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”

Democrats have expressed confidence that the newly approved maps will withstand a legal challenge.

“These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court,” Brandon Richards, a Newsom spokesperson, said in a statement.

Republicans brought the lawsuit the morning after California voters decisively approved the redistricting measure, known as Proposition 50, which suspended the maps drawn by the state’s independent commission and installed new House districts designed to help Democrats secure up to five GOP-held seats. It was the most significant counterpunch by Democrats in the unprecedented redistricting war that began in Texas and spread across the country as Trump attempts to secure House Republicans’ fragile majority for the final years of his second term.

The plaintiffs assert that California’s map improperly used race as a factor to heavily favor Hispanic voters in violation of the US constitution. It asks a judge to block California from taking effect.

“Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Prop 50,” Jesus Osete, the second-highest ranking official in the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement, quoting from the lawsuit. “Californians were sold an illegal, racially gerrymandered map, but the US Constitution prohibits its use in 2026 and beyond.”

The plaintiffs are being represented by the Dhillon Law Group, which was founded by Harmeet Dhillon, who is now assistant attorney general overseeing the US Department of Justice civil rights division. The firm also represented California Republicans earlier this year in their unsuccessful attempt to prevent the special election from taking place.

Dhillon has been recused from this case, the justice department said.

Unlike elsewhere, where Republican state legislatures have enacted gerrymanders, California’s plan required voter approval, which it received last week, with nearly 65% of the vote.

“It is a shame that the hacks at the highest levels of the justice department are more intent on overturning the results of a free and fair election in California and eliminating the voting rights of communities of color in Texas and Louisiana than they are on releasing the information they fear in the Epstein files,” Eric H Holder, Jr, the attorney general of the US and Chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) in a statement.

“Unlike the scheme imposed on the citizens of Texas, Californians just overwhelmingly voted in favor of the state’s new congressional map by nearly 30 percentage points at the ballot box to fight back against Trump’s gerrymandering scheme. That resounding rejection by the people clearly terrifies many Republicans and the Trump White House – it’s no wonder they are now resorting to hypocritical, desperate and truly absurd lawsuits while at the same time continuing to beg Republicans across the country to gerrymander, all in an effort to circumvent the will of the people.”

Democrats need to flip just a handful of Republican-held House seats to take control of the chamber in next year’s midterm election. The party that holds the majority will shape the final years of Trump’s second term in the White House, determining whether a unified Republican Congress will continue to deliver on his agenda or whether he will be met with resistance, investigations and possibly even a third impeachment attempt.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4826f04fd59e28bf23c75eb9effc520471307cac/223_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=844a502efd9bc43a275d2bbd787b09a0",N,,2025-11-14 01:57:00.975664

In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.
During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives.
Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.
In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves.","Peebles asked the probation manager if Horton could be arrested when he came in for a court date the next day. Horton’s probation file shows the manager said she would try to help.

But Horton never showed up to court, according to his probation file, and Nashville police didn’t arrest him until it was too late.

Ten days after that call, probation and police records show, Horton waited for Peebles outside her apartment. Khloe told WPLN she remembers seeing Horton pointing a gun at her mom. She remembers throwing her arms around his legs and pleading with him, “no, no, no.” She remembers trying to call 911 while her mom, shot in both legs, lay in the street bleeding to death.

Horton is now awaiting trial on charges of killing Peebles. He and his lawyer declined to comment for this story. The case file is sealed and the public defender’s office declined to comment further on whether Horton has entered a plea.

Throughout the period when Peebles reported he was threatening and hurting her, Horton was released repeatedly into the community under the stipulation that probation officers would be actively supervising him. But in Tennessee, a state with one of the highest rates of women killed by men, WPLN and ProPublica found that a deadly blind spot in the probation supervision system emerges at a time when experts say domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable.

When an offender under probation supervision violates the rules by being charged with a new crime or being found with a firearm, for example, a warrant may be issued for their arrest. When law enforcement serves that warrant, the offender can either end up behind bars or back out on probation while awaiting a court date.

But between the time a probation violation warrant is signed by a judge and when it is served, probation officers stop conducting any in-person supervision: For a high-risk offender, this means probation officers are no longer holding three in-person meetings per month; they also no longer conduct a monthly unannounced home visit to look for drugs and guns. That period of suspended face-to-face checks can stretch for months — in one instance, for more than 400 days.

In Horton’s case, he remained free, armed and dangerous for three months.

That pause of in-person supervision is spelled out in the Tennessee Department of Correction’s standards of supervision. Between 2019 and 2022, WPLN and ProPublica found at least six people, including Peebles, were shot to death during the gap in oversight. All were young Black mothers, ages 20 to 31. One victim was a cheerleading coach and a mom of two. Another woman was shot while her 2-year-old daughter lay on the bed nearby. In a third case, a mother of three was found in a creek days before Christmas with a purple domestic violence bracelet around her wrist. Their deaths left 12 children without their mothers.

TDOC declined to make any probation officials available for this story. In an emailed statement, Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said that “supervision remains active” for offenders who have warrants but “the objective changes.” Instead of ensuring offenders are abiding by the rules of probation, she said, officers help to bring that person into custody by sharing relevant case information with law enforcement. Gallagher confirmed there is no in-person supervision during that time.

This blind spot is one of the ways that the state failed to stop offenders from harming domestic violence victims. WPLN and ProPublica examined hundreds of fatal domestic violence shootings between 2007 and 2023 in Tennessee’s five most populous cities. The reporting, which expanded on our earlier investigations into Tennessee’s lax enforcement of gun prohibitions, found that among these fatal domestic violence shootings, at least 86 people — about 1 in every 4 — were allegedly killed by a suspect who was legally prohibited from having a firearm. Sixteen of those suspects were also on probation. In a Second Amendment-friendly state like Tennessee where laws make it easy for more people to carry firearms in more places, little can stop a person intent on getting a gun, even if they are legally barred from doing so. One backstop is the state’s probation officers, who are in close contact with violent, high-risk offenders and can search homes for prohibited weapons without a warrant if they have “reasonable suspicion,” TDOC said.

According to the department’s own documents, a probation officer’s mission is to ensure public safety. In cases where there is an open warrant, the department relies on law enforcement to prioritize the arrests of probation violators and on judges to incarcerate repeat violators instead of releasing them back into supervision and the community. The result: Some offenders like Horton return to the street.

“The system did her wrong,” Peebles’ mom, Karen Peebles, said. “If the police department had did their job, and the probation office had did theirs — I think it could have been prevented.”

“The Red Flags”

Peebles’s friends and family called her Chippie because she had a high, singsongy voice, like a chipmunk. She was loud, funny and always smiling. Almost every night, Peebles talked to her mom on the phone, and she never missed a Sunday dinner.

Her family said she started dating Horton around 2018, giving in after he had pursued her for years. She was hesitant, in part because of his criminal history. Horton had just started 10 years of supervised probation after he pleaded guilty to facilitation of second-degree murder in a robbery where a man was shot and killed.

“Even when she saw the red flags, she would just try anything in her power to try to make him better,” her cousin Princess Pinkston said. “She felt like she could save everybody.”

The probation department classified Horton as a high-risk violent probationer, which meant that every month his probation officer was required to see him face-to-face three times, conduct a home visit and check to make sure he hadn’t been arrested. This kind of supervision is more intensive and time-consuming than what low-risk offenders get.

In some probation departments across the country, probation officers are assigned either high-, medium- or low-risk offenders. Experts say this allows specialized teams to focus on intense monitoring of a smaller caseload of high-risk offenders, while lower-risk probationers are left to newer officers.

“It’s like the medical profession,” said Susan Rice, former president of the American Probation and Parole Association. “If you’re a specialist doctor and you do only the high-risk heart surgeries, you’re not going to have as many clients as a general practitioner who sees everybody that comes in with a runny nose.”

But in Tennessee, officers handle a mix of high-, medium- and low-risk offenders. And Tennessee’s probation offices do not have specialized domestic violence teams or training. A report from victim advocates more than a decade ago said these changes could save lives in the most dangerous cases. “This report should be viewed as a guide for where to begin changing policy,” the report reads, “and by doing so, ultimately reduce the occurrence of domestic violence homicides in Nashville-Davidson County.”

Rice said it is common practice nationwide to have mixed caseloads in probation departments. In an email, TDOC said the same, adding that all officers are “trained in areas like situational awareness and de-escalation techniques to identify warning signs and manage conflict.”

Most of the 16 alleged suspects who WPLN and ProPublica found were both prohibited from having a gun and under supervision by the probation department were deemed high or moderate risks by TDOC.

In addition, all 16 were under supervision in Memphis or Nashville, the state’s busiest offices. In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.

Horton was assigned to the Nashville office, eventually coming under the supervision of probation officer Derrick Finch, who had been on the job a little more than a year at the time. Finch told WPLN that at one point he had more than 100 offenders in his caseload. Records show the department fired him in 2024 after seven years on the job for reporting that he conducted a home visit with an offender who was in custody at that time. Finch said he thought he had conducted the visit when he was entering his case notes at the end of the month.

“I got let go because I couldn’t keep up with the caseload anymore,” Finch explained in an interview with WPLN.

By early January of 2019, Horton had been on probation for about a year. His relationship with Peebles was fracturing and she was referring to him as her ex in court records. She joined her own family dinners less frequently, and when she did show up, her mom said, something was always off. She would wear long-sleeved shirts, even in the middle of sweltering Tennessee summers. Once she arrived on crutches, claiming she had fallen down the stairs. Another time she had a black eye, and told her family that a door had swung back and hit her.

Multiple studies have shown that the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are trying to leave their abuser, often turning to the courts and law enforcement for protection.

But the case notes in Horton’s probation file seem to only scratch the surface of what her family suspected was happening behind closed doors. The case notes show Finch ticking through a standardized assessment of Horton’s progress, noting his body language, behavior and next steps. “Offender reported as directed.”

“Offender was calm, alert and oriented.”

“Offender seeking full-time employment at this time.”

“Offender advises he is in process of moving in with his mother.”

“Will advise offender next report date.”

Finch said the department wants officers to have a rapport with the offenders they are supervising, “but who’s got time for that? It’s very hard to do everything they want you to do, because there’s so much to do.”

He said when a “problem child” arose in his caseload, there was not much he could do about it.

“If this guy wants to change, we can help him,” Finch said of probationers. “But if he doesn’t — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do?”

“A Slap on the Wrist”

In a court document, Peebles alleged that on Jan. 12, 2019, Horton went on Facebook Live and said he would kill her before he saw her with another man. He called her multiple times, she wrote, then showed up at her house, blocking her car with his. They started arguing. He punched her twice in the head. She ran to her car to escape and he chased her, she wrote. He tore the windshield wipers off of her car and used them to strike the glass as she cowered inside the locked vehicle. Horton fled when she called police.

What followed was a string of actions by probation officers, law enforcement and the courts that left Horton free and Peebles afraid.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department filed a domestic assault charge against Horton. MNPD arrested Horton and searched his home for weapons, according to probation records. He paid a bond to get out of jail while awaiting his court date.

According to TDOC policy, Horton’s arrest on suspicion of domestic assault required Finch to file a report and request a warrant for a probation violation.

That policy says that warrants for violations posing “an immediate and/or imminent threat to public safety” should be requested “as soon as possible.” Finch submitted a violation warrant to his supervisor and requested a judge sign it on Jan. 22, 2019, according to probation records.

Once a judge signed it, the warrant was sent to police, who arrested Horton two days later. But at a court hearing, Peebles failed to appear to testify on the assault charge and the case was dismissed. Her mom said that Peebles did not show up because she was afraid, and that Horton had threatened her if she pursued charges.

“The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence,” Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office, said. “If the evidence isn’t there, we have no choice, we can’t go forward.”

For this reason, the Nashville Office of Family Safety has called for the district attorney’s office to rely more on evidence such as 911 calls, body camera footage or forensic exams instead of just victim testimony.

Once the assault charge against Horton was dropped, the probation violation that was based on those charges was dismissed. Horton remained in the community under Finch’s supervision.

And it didn’t take long before the process started all over again.

On Jan. 28, 2019, Horton was arrested in nearby Marshall County. Law enforcement officers reported finding four bags of a white substance believed to be cocaine on him, as well as a stolen Glock 26 9 mm handgun.

Being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with the intent to sell is a probation violation, as is being a felon in possession of firearms.

So, records show, Finch requested another probation violation warrant to bring Horton in front of a judge. Horton was arrested and released on bond the next day.

Despite Horton’s status as a high-risk offender, his multiple arrests in a month and his possession of a prohibited firearm, Judge Jennifer Smith returned Horton to probation supervision instead of incarcerating him. In a statement to WPLN, Smith said she cannot comment on previous decisions.

In at least two other domestic violence gun homicide cases in 2021 a probationer was caught with a gun prior to the shooting — even though they were prohibited from having a firearm because of a prior conviction and because they were on probation. As with Horton, judges did not revoke their probation for being found with a gun.

“There are people who are telling us over and over again with their actions that they have no desire to change,” said Becky Bullard, deputy director of programs at Nashville’s Office of Family Safety, about abusers on probation who continue to perpetuate harm. “And when someone is waving that flag to us to say, ‘Hey, I’m out here practicing all of these high-risk behaviors with someone I’m supposed to care about,’ that is someone raising their hand and telling us that they’re about to murder.”

Shari Bryant was a Nashville probation officer from 2020 to 2025, and she said she left the job to become an accountant. She said it was common for someone to continuously violate probation with few consequences. Even in these high-risk, violent cases.

In one of the case files TDOC provided in response to WPLN and ProPublica’s record requests, a Memphis offender named Torian Williams was sentenced to probation for aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon. He was classified as a medium risk and charged while on probation for having two guns. He would go on to shoot and kill his 20-year-old girlfriend Demya Gordon in 2021. For that crime, he took a plea deal for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was released to probation again. During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives. Williams died in 2025.

“Obviously, they’re not learning their lessons, right? They just keep getting a slap on the wrist,” Bryant said. “They keep getting out and getting away with it.”

That revolving door allowed Horton to remain on probation and return to the street again.

“He Is Going to Kill Me”

Months before she was killed, Peebles was in the bedroom of her apartment when she heard a loud boom at the back door. It was a stormy summer night, July 13, 2019.

“I got up walked to the door seen Brandon with a gun,” she wrote in a court document. He pointed the gun at her, and she ran out of her apartment. A neighbor later told the court that she was awakened by gunshots that went through her roof, her walls and her mirror. The neighbor, peeking through the blinds, saw Horton running with a gun in his hand. A few moments later, she saw Peebles climbing down a tree.

When police arrived, they could not find Horton. Metro Nashville Police Department charged him with felon in possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. And, for the third time in less than a year, Finch requested a probation violation warrant for Horton’s arrest.

Then, as is spelled out in TDOC’s standards of supervision, Finch stopped supervising Horton in person until police could arrest him. In the past, police served the warrant in a matter of days. This time, it would take three months for the police to catch up with Horton. For those three months, all that was required of Finch was a once-a-month check for arrests in the computer system. Police would not arrest Horton until after he allegedly killed Peebles. He has been behind bars ever since.

Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.

“It’s kind of a messed-up process,” said Rice of the American Probation and Parole Association. “Do we really want that period of supervision to stop if they’re not incarcerated during that time?”

In the six cases of domestic violence homicide that occurred during this supervision gap, WPLN and ProPublica found the time between when a warrant was issued and when police made an arrest stretched from as few as nine days to as many as 425 days. In all six cases, the alleged offender was put on probation for a gun-related offense. In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves. But in Tennessee, officers must contact law enforcement. TDOC said while probation officers cannot make arrests themselves, they work with local, state and federal law enforcement, sharing information such as “addresses, photographs, known associates, and other leads” to assist in locating the offender.

When asked why it took so long to serve warrants in cases like Horton’s, the Metro Nashville Police Department said that “wanted persons frequently change where they stay or leave town and they are often difficult to locate.” MNPD said it works closely with probation officers to serve offenders if they continue to come in for office visits or when they show up for their court dates.

MNPD said it has one documented attempt to serve Horton’s violation warrant between the time it was issued in July and Oct. 17, when Peebles was killed. That attempt was on Oct. 9. Police said no one answered the door at Horton’s address.

Peebles requested another protection order against Horton in October 2019. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.

“Detectives spend their days researching people with outstanding warrants so they can arrest them,” said Debra Fessenden, chief policy adviser with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, an agency that handles warrants for Memphis. “No one is ignoring the warrants.”

She said that not all intelligence leads to a timely arrest.

“It’s not unusual — because of resources, training and protocol — that law enforcement decides, ‘We’ll just serve this when we pull someone over’” for a traffic stop, said Julia Weber, a California-based expert who trains law enforcement and probation departments on dangerous domestic violence cases.

“What I tell communities is we have to recognize how dangerous a decision that is.”

In her final days, records show that Peebles was increasingly aware of how much danger she was in.

She had already called the probation department once for help getting Horton’s warrant served at his Marshall County court date. Days later, on Oct. 11, she called again to say that Horton had failed to appear in court “because he spoke to officer finch and was told that he would be taken into custody at that time on his warrant,” the probation file notes. The manager wrote that Peebles was upset and that Horton was threatening to hurt her.

In an interview with WPLN, Finch denied warning Horton.

“Everything that could have been done was done from our end,” Finch said. “Once that warrant is filed, there is nothing else that we can do.”

Six days after Peebles’ final call to the probation department, Horton allegedly shot and killed her outside of her apartment while her daughter, Khloe, struggled to call for help. Horton was arrested the next morning, and Smith, the judge who had allowed his release, later revoked his probation.

“Chippie should be here with her child, with her mom,” said Pinkston, Peebles’ cousin. “She had told you many times, ‘No, he’s serious. He is going to kill me.’ … Now it’s too late.”

Khloe is in high school now. For a long time after her mom died, Khloe said, she heard the gunshots in her sleep. She lives in her mom’s childhood bedroom to feel closer to her.

She’s starting to fully understand the ways the system did not protect her mom from Horton. But the 14-year-old says she has lived each day since her mom’s death struggling with a guilt she cannot shake.

“I always felt like her death was on me,” Khloe said, remembering how she had forgotten her phone in the kitchen that day, so they returned to the apartment to get it. “If we would never went back to that house … maybe she would have still been here.”

Other transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.
Deciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty,” Jacobson said.
But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.
It adds that the ban places additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.","A Virginia transportation security officer is accusing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security of sex discrimination over a policy that bars transgender officers from performing security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.

The Transportation Security Administration, which operates under DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.

According to internal documents explaining the policy change that The Associated Press obtained from four independent sources, including two current and two former TSA workers, “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveler’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveler elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area.”

Until February, TSA assigned work consistent with officers’ gender identity under a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP it rescinded that directive to comply with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order.

Although transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications,” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.

A transgender officer at Dulles International Airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleges in her lawsuit filed Friday that the new policy — which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity — violates civil rights law.

“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialized certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.

Mittereder declined to speak with the AP but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called TSA’s policy “terribly demeaning and 100% illegal.”

TSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “Male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs.”

The legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the recent government shutdown that left thousands of agents working without pay.

Other transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.

Kai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, but retired in July in large part because of the new policy. Regan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021 and said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.

“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old, who worried that he would soon be fired for his gender identity, so he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop.”

Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward — a legal organization that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court — called TSA’s policy “arbitrary and discriminatory,” adding: “There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity.”

DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.

“Does the AP want female travelers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritize mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travelers.”

Airport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H. Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimizing passenger discomfort during screening. Travelers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.

Deciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty,” Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.

“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.

TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveler should be patted down based on his/her declared sex.” For passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female,” the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex,” and to contact a supervisor if concerns persist.

The documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation.”

But the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so,” Puth said.

According to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public,” the lawsuit said.

“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”

Being unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says. It adds that the ban places additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.

American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley urged TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public.”

“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained Sami Hamdi, a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport.
At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa.
At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.
It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide.","A British journalist and political commentator detained by US immigration officers for more than two weeks warned of “an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide” as he returned to the UK Thursday.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had detained Sami Hamdi, a London-based father-of-three on October 26 at San Francisco International Airport. ICE stopped him the day after he addressed the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) California’s annual gala, while he was en route to Florida to speak at a similar event.

At the time, authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. However, Hamdi and his legal team said he was in the US on a valid visa and was detained for speaking out about Israel’s war in Gaza as “political retaliation.”

Hamdi recounted his 18 day ordeal to CNN shortly after his return to London.

“When I entered San Francisco airport to fly to Florida, I went through security. As I looked for my gate, D38 to Tampa, a man walked up to me and said… ‘your visa was revoked two days ago, so now you are here illegally.’”

Hamdi said the news came as a surprise, and he told the officials who had approached him that he had not been informed his visa was under review. He said he was then presented with a memo from the US State Department that said his visa had been revoked, without a reason as to why.

When asked about any evidence that would show that Hamdi had overstayed his visa on Thursday, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told CNN that he wasn’t able to speak on specific cases but said: “We’re going to enforce our immigration laws…We’re revoking visas when appropriate, in line with our national security.”

At the airport, Hamdi said he asked officers for an explanation for the revocation, saying that if there wasn’t one, he would just “book my ticket to London and fly home.”

He said the officers then told him: “‘That’s not the way this works here,’” before escorting him out of the terminal to a vehicle that was waiting for him.

Hamdi said he was told to get in the car, but initially refused, telling the officers: “With the greatest of respect, this looks like the movies. I’m not getting in any black car. I’m a British citizen. I have rights.”

Hamdi is known for his appearances on British TV, his analyses on Middle East developments, for his support of the Palestinian cause – and his criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.

After advocating for a phone call, Hamdi, said he briefly spoke with CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties organization, before he was taken to an ICE facility over four hours away.

“They loaded me into a van with tight cuffs on my feet and on my hands, and they drove me four hours…and a half… I had to do a swap in the middle with a different car. And then they took me to the middle of nowhere,” he said.

At the detention center, Hamdi said he endured “harsh” conditions, alongside nearly 100 people in an overcrowded room.

Despite never being charged with a crime, Hamdi said he was kept in shackles in for-profit facilities with little oversight.

“The reality is that those those facilities are dehumanizing to the human beings (there), and when you look at the stories of the other inmates, it only breaks your heart,” he said, recounting multiple stories of fathers with green cards who had been detained without charge.

“It’s not that the courts won’t find them innocent, it’s that it seems there’s a concerted effort to make sure they do not go in front of a judge,” he said.

DHS did not respond to CNN’s query on Hamdi’s claims about his time in ICE detention Thursday but Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reiterated an earlier statement that said: “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”

“I want to say that this wasn’t just an attack on me. It was an attack on the freedoms of ordinary Americans and citizens worldwide. It was an attack on their freedom to speak the truth in the face of hatred,” Hamdi said shortly after he returned back to the UK.

Hamdi first came under fire after speaking at an event in London in 2023 following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. There, he told his audience not to pity Palestinians but rather to “celebrate the victory,” in remarks from a speech that he told CNN were taken out of context.

In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”

“My argument was that we have to solve the issue of the rights of the Palestinians. We have to solve the issue of occupation, apartheid, and that will bring peace to the region,” he said.

“I think that the reason that my visa was targeted was not because of anything that I was saying but it was because Americans were listening,” he said Thursday.

“Public opinion is shifting because people are seeing the truth,” he added, alluding to growing awareness of suffering in Gaza.

An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has firmly denied accusations of genocide.

Laura Loomer, a conservative American activist with a direct line to Trump, said in late October that Hamdi’s detention had come after she had applied “relentless pressure” on the State Department and DHS. She accused Hamdi of being a supporter of Hamas. CAIR has accused Loomer of being an “anti-Muslim extremist.”

Hamdi said his “detention was a stark demonstration that a Muslim journalist can be held captive because extremists, amplified on social media, seek to weaponize state policy against inconvenient speech.”

Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student Momodou Taal had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.

Civil rights organizations have criticized the actions of the Trump administration, saying that they violate free speech protections, which apply to anyone who is legally in the US, regardless of citizenship status.

Hussam Ayloush, CAIR California CEO, said in a Thursday statement Hamdi’s detention should “alarm anyone who cares about the rule of law.”

While Hamdi said he is mulling whether to sue US authorities, he also said he would rather take what he considers a win, and instead “celebrate” the decisions of the “cool heads” in the US State Department and federal court system.

“I won this case, the extremists failed to silence my voice, they failed to remove my freedom of speech. America stood with me,” he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending time with his family and a game of soccer over the weekend.

While he said he is grateful for the global attention brought to his case, he also implied that he is keen to exit the limelight.

“I am not the story,” he added. “The story is one of the most heinous genocides of our time. The story is about kids who had their heads blown off. The story is about kids who had their legs blown off. The story is about innocent women and children who were bombed into oblivion for crimes they did not commit,” he said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-13t152618z-259442261-rc2pvha5fln7-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-hamdi-britain.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-13 23:56:24.619374

The federal judge’s ruling confirmed that ICE is not,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg.
They were being held at the Caroline Detention Facility and the Farmville Detention Facility, both of which typically house adults.
On Wednesday, the court ordered a third plaintiff released — another client of the ACLU-VA who also entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and is eligible for SIJS protections.
For the three young immigrants now ordered released, the rulings mean freedom from detention and the chance to continue the SIJS process outside a jail setting.","This article was reprinted with permission from Virginia Mercury.

In a decisive rebuke of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an immigration judge on Wednesday ordered the agency to release a young immigrant held at a Virginia detention center — one day after the same court ordered the release of two brothers at the center of a class-action challenge to ICE’s treatment of Special Immigrant Juvenile Status applicants.

The two brothers, both in their late teens, were ordered released on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the court granted release to a third young immigrant in the same age group who, like the brothers, entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and later applied for SIJS, a pathway toward permanent legal protection. All three had been detained since August.

“These young brothers came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and cannot safely return to their home countries after it was determined that they were abused, abandoned, or neglected,” said ACLU of Virginia Legal Director Eden Heilman in a statement.

“Federal law says they have every legal right to be in the United States, and that ICE should never have put them in a detention center. Now they will finally be freed from detention and reunited with each other.”

ICE has not commented publicly on the Virginia rulings, and agency representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A legal pathway ignored

Congress almost four decades ago created SIJS to give vulnerable children a path toward lawful permanent residency. The process requires a state court to determine that the child cannot safely return to their country of origin, followed by a visa application and, eventually, an adjustment to citizenship.

Those granted or applying for SIJS are not typically subject to mandatory detention.

Yet, the class-action complaint, filed in October by the ACLU of Virginia and partner counsel in the Alexandria Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, contends that ICE, under current policies, is treating SIJS-eligible youth as “arriving noncitizens” who must be detained without bond — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the U.S. Constitution.

“Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. The federal judge’s ruling confirmed that ICE is not,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg. “By ignoring the legal process Congress established decades ago, ICE is causing the very chaos and confusion that the Trump administration claims it’s working to fix.”

The federal judge’s order requires ICE to provide bond hearings to the named plaintiffs and bars the government from denying bond or invoking automatic stays if bond is granted.

The immigration court’s Tuesday order released the two brothers, both of whom arrived in the U.S. as minors and have SIJS applications or approvals. They were being held at the Caroline Detention Facility and the Farmville Detention Facility, both of which typically house adults.

On Wednesday, the court ordered a third plaintiff released — another client of the ACLU-VA who also entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and is eligible for SIJS protections. That ruling marked at least the second time this week the court rejected ICE’s argument that SIJS-eligible youth may be detained without bond.

A broader trend

Virginia’s case reflects a nationwide surge of litigation over ICE’s increasingly aggressive detention of immigrants — including youth with protected statuses — without access to bond hearings. For example, in Massachusetts, a federal judge recently certified a class action challenging denials of bond hearings to immigrants held without inspection.

In New Bedford, Mass., a judge last month ordered the release of an 18-year-old SIJS recipient held in a county facility despite his protected status.

A July 2025 memo from ICE declared that undocumented immigrants who entered without inspection could be detained throughout their removal proceedings — often months or years — without access to bond hearings.

“These cases show the growing force of legal challenges to ICE’s detention practices,” the Amica Center wrote after a separate court ruling this fall.

What’s at stake

Over the summer, immigration‐enforcement tactics in Virginia spurred widespread public protest.

Dozens gathered outside rallies organized by the Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality, calling for an end to local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement following a wave of “masked, unmarked” detentions in the region.

In June and July, activists confronted courthouse raids in Chesterfield County and other sites, decrying what they described as “abduction-style” arrests of immigrants — many without criminal records. These protests underscored mounting local resistance as Virginia communities grapple with the human impact of enforcement policies.

For the three young immigrants now ordered released, the rulings mean freedom from detention and the chance to continue the SIJS process outside a jail setting.

But the broader class-action lawsuit remains in early stages, and thousands of other SIJS-eligible youth nationwide remain subject to detention policies advocates say misinterpret federal law.",https://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/California_Immigration_Shooting_12929-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 21:56:47.504818

Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Director Joseph Edlow, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has taken critical steps to restore sanity and integrity to our immigration system. Since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has closed loopholes and implemented critically needed changes to better protect American communities and workers.

“The distinction between legal and illegal immigration becomes meaningless when both can destroy a country at its foundation, “said USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser. “Unchecked mass migration floods the American labor market, depressing wages and taking jobs away from hardworking Americans, while straining healthcare, education, and housing systems. The Trump administration continues to execute policies to ensure legal immigration advances American interests first and only the most deserving attain the privilege of U.S. citizenship.”

USCIS is ending exploitation through categorical parole and the abuse of Temporary Protected Status. USCIS is returning to a faithful application of the law by ensuring the grant of parole and Temporary Protected Status are as Congress intended. TPS is now truly temporary, and USCIS terminated categorical parole programs like the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan parole program. We now consider parole requests strictly on a case-by-case basis.

Secretary Noem ended TPS for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela (2023 extension and 2021 designation), Syria, and South Sudan. Hundreds of thousands of aliens without authorization to remain in the country have been encouraged to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP Home app to depart from the United States.

USCIS is implementing rigorous screening and vetting protocols and actively assisting ICE and other law enforcement partners to enforce immigration law and protect public safety. Since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has referred almost 3,200 individuals with orders of removal, active wants/warrants and other criminal indicators to ICE and other law enforcement entities, resulting in the apprehension of almost 2,000 criminal and illegal aliens at USCIS facilities since Jan. 20, 2025. In addition, since Jan. 20, 2025, USCIS has made 13,225 referrals to ICE for fraud, public safety and national security concerns, including 320 for confirmed or suspected Foreign Terrorist Organization gang members. Press releases highlighting USCIS involvement in arrests and convictions can be found in the USCIS Newsroom.

USCIS spearheaded the largest fraud investigation in agency history, Operation Twin Shield, a targeted enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area that uncovered marriage fraud, abuse of H-1B and student visas, and an alien with terrorist ties in September. Also in September, USCIS teamed with the Department of Justice, the FBI, and agencies across DHS to help take down a multi-million-dollar asylum fraud, human trafficking, and money laundering conspiracy.

USCIS is reviewing aliens’ use of social media and other statements for anti-American ideologies to determine whether an alien endorses, espouses, promotes, or supports anti-American activity and considering it as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests. In FY25, USCIS completed 12,502 individual social media checks.

USCIS is recruiting Homeland Defenders and implementing new law enforcement authorities to restore integrity to the immigration system. USCIS initiated a largescale hiring campaign on Sept. 30, and has received nearly 35,000 applications—the most for any position in agency history. These dedicated patriots will execute the agency’s critical mission to administer the nation’s lawful immigration system while safeguarding the country from fraud and national security or public safety threats. USCIS also received law enforcement authorities delegated from the Secretary of Homeland Security. With these new authorities, USCIS special agents will be further empowered to investigate, arrest, and present for prosecution those who violate America’s immigration laws under a final rule that published in September 2025.

USCIS is restoring integrity in the naturalization process by ensuring that only those who truly deserve it are granted the most sacred status we can bestow, that of United States citizen. USCIS is committed to fully vetting every alien and making the process one that the American people are confident in. We launched a revised civics test with more questions in October to ensure that naturalization applicants have a full understanding of American history and government before they can become U.S. citizens. USCIS also refocused the way we consider the good moral character of potential citizens, looking for positive contributions to our communities rather than merely the absence of bad behavior. We restored the practice of conducting neighborhood investigations of potential new citizens to verify their claims and ensure we get a full picture of their character.

USCIS has returned to a commonsense policy for issuing Notices to Appear (NTA), and since February 2025 has issued more than 172,000 NTAs to restore integrity and ensure the security of our nation’s immigration system. The agency is committed to using its NTA authorities against removable aliens and will no longer exempt specific classes or categories from potential enforcement.

DHS announced an interim final rule ending the practice of automatically extending employment authorization documents for aliens filing renewal applications in certain employment authorization categories. With this rule, DHS prioritizes the proper screening and vetting of aliens before extending the validity of their employment authorizations.

USCIS is helping to secure the Nation’s electoral process with an overhaul of the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) in partnership with the Social Security Administration to ensure a single, reliable source for verifying immigration status and U.S. citizenship nationwide. State and local authorities can now input full Social Security numbers or just the last four digits to help verify U.S. citizenship and prevent aliens from voting in American elections. We also eliminated fees for participating state, local, territorial, and tribal government users; streamlined mass alien status checks; and integrated criminal records, immigration timelines, and addresses into results. Since making these changes, SAVE has processed more than 46 million voter verification queries.

USCIS is ensuring aliens do not become a burden on the government and issued a policy memo affirming that USCIS officers can once again be fully empowered to exercise their authority to exclude any alien who is likely at any time to become a public charge. USCIS is committed to the core principle of U.S. immigration law after years of neglect. The guidance reminds aliens that they have the burden of proof in demonstrating that they are not likely at any time to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.

USCIS is doing its part to protect American workers by implementing the President’s Proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, an important initial step to reform the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. Under the Proclamation, as of Sept. 21, H-1B petitions must be accompanied by an additional $100,000 payment as a condition of eligibility.",https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/images/social-media/OPA-SM_USCISonBlue_FB_1200x627_V1.png,N,,2025-11-13 21:56:52.204689

After morning Mass, demonstrators marched half a mile with signs, flowers and a crucifix — stopping at Miami’s federal immigration court.

The prayer vigil coincided with the Feast Day of Mother Cabrini, recognizing the patron saint of immigrants and the first American saint. It’s part of the national One Church, One Family movement, which urges parishes, schools, and faith-based groups to host prayerful public events to promote the dignity of every person.

“ We come here today asking God to give us the grace to speak truth to power, and the strength to work endlessly to protect the human rights and the human dignity of immigrants,” said Father Federico Capdepón of Corpus Christi Catholic Church.

St. Frances Xavier Cabrini aided Italian-American immigrants during a time of heavy prejudice in America and anti-Italian sentiment in the Catholic Church. Her story was depicted in the 2024 movie drama Cabrini.

The service featured statements from Catholic leaders, prayer songs and a musical performance.

After group prayer, speakers paid tribute to 25 detainees who died in captivity since the start of the year. Before each flower was set down, attendees said “Presente,” or present in English.

“In Latin American countries, when you mention the name of somebody who has deceased, we say ‘Presente,’” said vigil organizer Sylvia Muñoz, of the Pedro Arrupe Jesuit Institute, . “In spirit, they’re with us.”

The American Immigration Council reported 2025 as the deadliest for ICE detainees since 2004. They said 23 immigrants died in federal custody in the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. Two more people have died in ICE detention since Sept. 30.

Muñoz organized a similar prayer vigil last month at a Miramar federal immigration field office.

For Ellie Hidalgo, co-director of the Catholic women’s leadership group Discerning Deacons, this gathering was her way of honoring her parents who fled Cuba.

“It's my turn to put my faith into action and help our very vulnerable immigrants who are facing much harsher conditions,” Hidalgo told WLRN.

Maria Asuncion Bilbao of the Quaker-founded American Friends Service Committee said the event draws attention to why detained immigrants have the right to due process in immigration courts.

“ What is happening in this country is really sad,” Bilbao told WLRN. “[It’s] a dark moment of the history for this country.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5e34fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2363+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F34%2F1b72b58b43b297cb406c6eae433c%2Finterfaith1.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 22:56:27.830458

U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura McNally scheduled the four-hour tour of the Broadview facility after U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order, which required federal authorities to improve sanitary conditions inside.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit joined McNally on the tour of the facility to see if the federal government is complying with the court-ordered improvements inside. It was the first time attorneys for detainees have been able to access the building where many – if not all – immigrants arrested in the Chicago area have been taken during Operation Midway Blitz.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not speak to reporters after completing the tour. In a statement from the MacArthur Justice Center, the ACLU of Illinois, and Eimer Stahl of Chicago, attorneys declined to discuss the conditions they saw inside the facility during the tour:

""We are grateful that the court gave us an opportunity to inspect the Broadview facility. We remain committed to ensuring that any detainees at Broadview are treated with dignity, have access to counsel, and are provided due process. We will reserve detailed observations for our legal filings and presentations in the weeks ahead. We encourage anyone detained at Broadview and lawyers facing complications communicating with their clients at the facility to let us know about problems at the facility.""

The tour was part of a case challenging the conditions inside the facility, which the government has described as a short-term processing hub where ICE books and transfers people to other locations.

The facility is designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours, but since the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Chicago area began, often has held some migrants for days.

Attorneys for detainees held at the facility have claimed it is overcrowded, that people inside have been denied access to showers, soap, and other hygiene products, and that detainees haven't been able to receive proper medical care or contact their lawyers.

Five attorneys for those detainees were able to join on this first-of-its-kind visit on Thursday to see if ICE is complying with the court order to improve conditions inside, and also were allowed to bring along a translator and a detention expert.

While they were allowed to take photographs during their visit, but the government will be allowed to review those photos before deciding if they would be sealed to the public or not, or if potentially sensitive information should be blurred, such as faces or security locks.

A previously filed court document in the case includes a map of the interior of the Broadview facility. While it shows six holding cells, bench-style sleeping areas, foil blankets, and limited visibility between rooms, notably there are no dimensions to see how large each holding cell is. That was something the judge and attorneys were able to review during their tour.

The visit comes a little over a week since Judge Gettleman's order mandating ICE to provide detainees at Broadview with clean bedding and sufficient space to sleep if they are held overnight; a shower at least every other day; clean toilet facilities; three full meals per day; a bottle of water with each meal; adequate supplies of soap, toilet paper, and other hygiene products; and menstrual products and prescribed medications.

Holding cells also must be cleaned at least twice a day, and detainees must be provided free and private phone calls with their attorneys. Detainees also must be given a list of pro bono attorneys in English and Spanish upon arrival at the facility, along with interpreter services if needed. Detainees also must be listed on ICE's online detainee locator system as soon as they arrive at the Broadview facility.

Part of the reason for Thursday's visit to Broadview was to see if those rules have been implemented.

CBS legal analyst Irv Miller said the judge has the authority to shut down the facility if there are violations.

""The judge wants to see things for herself, and I don't blame her,"" Miller said.

Gettleman extended his temporary restraining order to Dec. 17 while the plaintiffs' attorneys await other evidence about the conditions in Broadview, including a log of detainees held at the facility.

They also want to review surveillance video from inside.

Gettleman is set to decide later if his order mandating specific conditions inside the Broadview facility will be made permanent.

Hundreds arrested in ""Operation Midway Blitz"" may be released

On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered that hundreds of people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be released from federal facilities in the next week because their arrests by ICE were possibly unlawful and in violation of a federal court order.

Boston.com has also contacted Boston University College Republicans and the university for comment.

Segal’s tweet was in response to a Boston.com article about the ICE raid, which purportedly saw masked agents rounding up car wash employees without giving them the chance to retrieve work permits from their lockers.

Todd Pomerleau, an attorney representing the workers, said none of them had criminal records that would warrant deportation. The majority of the workers are scheduled for bond hearings next week, and Pomerleau said he expects they will be released on bond.

“They’re people living the American dream,” Pomerleau said by phone Thursday. “They were just grabbed and thrown in vans.”

Generally, being present in the U.S. without proper legal authorization is a civil violation, not a criminal act.

Segal appeared to double down in another social media post Thursday, sharing a screenshot of a Boston Globe article about his comments and writing, “We must stand up for this country.”

Reactions to his posts were mixed; while several people denounced Segal as racist, fascist, or a “disgrace” to BU, others proclaimed him a “patriot.”

Boston City Councilor Enrique Pepén even weighed in, writing, “If ‘standing up’ for this country means calling ICE on hard working residents who are contributing to our society, you must have the wrong priorities for this country. Shame on you.”

Pomerleau noted it’s increasingly common to see a rush to judgment based on someone’s skin color, ethnicity, job, or neighborhood. He decried Segal’s stance as devoid of facts or empathy.

“He’s entitled to his own opinion and beliefs, but I don’t respect that type of opinion,” Pomerleau said.

“I think he should ask BU for his money back, if he thinks like that,” Pomerleau added. “It’s disgusting and un-American.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/allstoncarwash-6910bfe222a4e-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 18:57:42.678752

For two months, a young Venezuelan woman who had been hired to clean the Buffalo Bills’ Highmark Stadium has been detained by ICE.

The woman, Yusgleidy Villa Alvarez, 18, has no criminal history. Until September, she’d been a legal resident of the United States, was on the path to obtaining a green card and had been granted a work permit. Yet without warning, a federal lawsuit alleges, ICE agents arrested her after a shift Sept. 19, the day after the Bills beat the Miami Dolphins at Highmark Stadium.

For more than a month, she was held at the Niagara County Jail, which has a contract with ICE to hold migrants, primarily women. She was later moved to another facility out of state.

Attorneys with the Erie County Bar Association’s Volunteer Lawyers Project are suing for her release, arguing that her detention is unconstitutional. The case offers a new glimpse into the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and how those efforts are manifesting in Western New York, particularly in regard to women detainees.

“Yusgleidy’s arrest and detention are wholly unjustified and unrelated to any individualized consideration of her circumstances,” her attorney, Aaron Aisen, wrote in the lawsuit, filed Oct. 23. “She has no criminal record anywhere in the world and family ties and employment in the United States. And yet despite all of this, she currently sits in a jail cell.”

Under its agreement with ICE, the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office earns $148 per day for each migrant it detains at its jail in Lockport. As of Nov. 12, the jail held 18 migrant women, though the number fluctuates day to day. By holding Villa Alvarez for more than a month, the Sheriff’s Office earned at least $6,300.

According to the lawsuit, Villa Alvarez entered the United States in August 2023 with two aunts and several cousins. Her father had abandoned her family when she was young, and her mother had died of brain cancer in January of that year.

A year later, in July 2024, federal immigration officials granted Villa Alvarez “special immigrant juvenile status,” setting her on the path to become a legal permanent resident. She was also granted a status known as “deferred action,” meaning she would not have to attend immigration court hearings and could avoid detention.

In February, U.S. Customs and Immigration Services approved her application for a work permit. The permit was valid through July 2028.

Villa Alvarez, the lawsuit states, began a job as a cleaner at Highmark Stadium on Sept. 19. Unbeknownst to her, however, Customs and Immigration Services terminated her work permit earlier that day. Along with that cancellation, her “deferred action” status was also terminated, meaning she could be subject to immigration court hearings and detention.

She worked a double shift and was then detained by ICE agents.

Such workplace raids have become common under the Trump administration. Investigative Post has previously documented raids of roofing and home construction job sites, for example.

In the lawsuit, Villa Alvarez’s attorneys argue that Customs and Immigration Services “did not perform a legitimate individual assessment of her case prior to arresting her” and that the Department of Homeland Security — the parent agency of ICE — “did not have a warrant to arrest her.”

Aisen, her lawyer, declined to comment for this story. But in the lawsuit, he argued that the federal government retroactively and improperly applied a policy change to his client.

In June, he wrote, Customs and Immigration Services changed how migrants with “special immigrant juvenile status” are treated. The change made those migrants subject to immigration court proceedings, and thus detention. Such changes typically apply to future immigration cases, rather than ones that have already been processed.

Aisen argues that Customs and Immigration Services applied that change to Villa Alvarez when it shouldn’t have.

“Under [Customs and Immigration Services’] own guidance, Yusgleidy’s deferred action should not have been terminated and she should never have been taken into ICE custody.”

Aisen further argues that applying the policy change to his client violates her due process rights under the Fifth Amendment and that her arrest violates the Fourth Amendment.

Trump administration lawyers filed a motion Wednesday to have the case dismissed. U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Wolford has not yet ruled on the matter.

Hegseth announces 'Operation Southern Spear' Pentagon mission to remove 'narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere'

In a social media post, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, just announced “Operation Southern Spear”, a new military mission apparently signaling that the war on drugs could soon be an actual war.

“President Trump ordered action — and the Department of War is delivering. Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR. Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and [US Southern Command],” Hegseth wrote on X.

This mission, he added, “defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighborhood – and we will protect it.”

He offered no other details, as strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and a massing of forces in the region have prompted widespread speculation that US military strikes on Venezuela are imminent.

The US Southern Command (Southcom) is the US military’s combatant command that encompasses 31 countries through South and Central America and the Caribbean.

Bizarrely, Hegseth’s announcement of the new operation on Thursday comes nearly 10 months after US Naval Forces Southern Command announced in January that “Operation Southern Spear … will start later this month” and would use “a heterogeneous mix of Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking” in the Caribbean.

As Epstein questions mount, Trump retreats from view, with no public events Friday

Donald Trump, the former gameshow host who normally loves being on television, has been unusually quiet and out of view since yesterday, when Democrats released emails from Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender who socialized with Trump for over a decade, which seemed to undermine Trump’s claims that he knew nothing about his friend’s sexual exploitation of minors.

On Wednesday, Trump made only one public appearance, at which he signed the legislation to reopen the government, read a brief set of prepared remarks and took no questions from reporters.

On Thursday, Trump only appeared to sign an executive order to support an initiative by his wife, made a set of rambling remarks, in which he brought up plans to knock through a wall of the White House to connect it to his new ballroom, and again took no questions.

The White House just notified reporters that Trump’s schedule for Friday includes no public events at all before he departs the White House for a weekend in Florida, where he will spend Saturday and Sunday out of public view.

Adding to the impression of radio silence is the fact that, so far on Thursday, Trump has also posted nothing at all on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon ask judge to end Epstein lawsuits

Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon asked a federal judge on Thursday to dismiss lawsuits accusing them of knowingly aiding Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking by providing banking services to the late convicted sex offender who socialized with Donald Trump for more than a decade, Reuters reports.

As Victoria Bekiempis reported for The Guardian last month, the lawsuits, filed by one of Epstein’s victims, a Florida woman known as Jane Doe, allege that these financial powerhouses illicitly enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. The suits were filed by Sigrid McCawley, of Boies Schiller Flexner, and Brad Edwards of Edwards Henderson, who have long represented Epstein victims.

The suits accused the banks of knowingly ignoring a “plethora” of information about Epstein’s crimes because they valued profit over protecting victims.

Both lawsuits said the banks should have filed suspicious activity reports with the US Treasury Department, which could have helped law enforcement stop Epstein sooner.

But in a filing in Manhattan federal court, Bank of America said Doe alleged merely that it provided routine services to people who at the time had no known links to Epstein, and any suggestion it was more deeply involved was “threadbare and meritless.”

BNY Mellon, in a separate filing, called Doe’s allegations “razor-thin,” and included no claims that Epstein was ever a customer or dealt with anyone in particular.

Trump refers to part of White House residence as 'a knock-out panel' to be demolished for his ballroom

Before we move past it, let’s pause for a moment to note that earlier on Thursday Donald Trump dropped a very strong hint that he intends to demolish at least part of the original exterior wall of the White House residence to link the historic building to his new ballroom.

During his remarks in the White House East Room, Trump turned and pointed to the golden drapes over the grand window that used to lead to the roof of the East Wing, before it was entirely demolished to make room for the ballroom.

“And right behind me by the way, in about two years from now, we’ll use a much bigger room,” Trump said. “It’ll be right here,” the president said, pointing at the large window in the center of the room, which was part of the original construction and was there when the second president, John Adams took up residence in the White House in 1800.

“It’ll be right here, this will be the entrance,” Trump said, waving his hand to show the contours of the new glass hallway he plans to build in place of the original window to connect the residence to the ballroom.

“That’s a knock-out panel, it’s called a knock-out,” Trump said, using a construction term for a removable section of a wall, designed during construction to be easily removed to allow for future expansion.

“It looks pretty nice right now, but gonna look a lot better in a little while,” the president said.

Trump’s description of the grand window that has stood for centuries, as historic presidential events unfolded in the East Room — including both Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy lying in state, Lyndon Johnson signing the Civil Rights Act, Richard Nixon bidding farewell to his staff, Bill Clinton apologizing for his affair with Monica Lewinsky and Barack Obama announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden — as something designed to be knocked out was obviously false.

But the matter-of-fact description of his plan to knock a hole in the exterior wall of the White House also contradicts his own claim, in July, that his ballroom project “won’t interfere with the current building, it won’t be… It will be near it but not touching it. It pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”

Trump ally refers fourth Democratic official for mortgage fraud - report

Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency known to some around the president as “Little Trump”, accused a Democratic representative, Eric Swalwell, of mortgage fraud in a letter to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Wednesday, NBC News reports.

Pulte has previous made the same accusation against two prominent Democratic critics of Donald Trump – New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, and Adam Schiff, a California senator – and a Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook.

After Pulte made the allegation against Cook, which Trump tried to use a grounds to fire her, Reuters reported that Pulte’s father and stepmother had filed housing claims similar to hers.

“As the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,” Swalwell said in a statement. “Like James Comey and John Bolton, Adam Schiff and Lisa Cook, Letitia James and the dozens more to come — I refuse to live in fear in what was once the freest country in the world,” he added.

“Eric Swalwell is a principled legislator who served with distinction as an Impeachment Manager during the second impeachment of Donald J. Trump”, the House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in response to the report. “The so-called charges being contemplated against him are laughable.”

”Bill Pulte is nothing more than a malignant hack who is abdicating his responsibility to help everyday Americans afford a home, and is instead wasting taxpayer dollars on baseless investigations into Donald Trump’s perceived political enemies,” Jeffries added.

Trump administration revokes Biden-era limits on Alaska oil drilling

The US Department of the Interior announced on Thursday that it was rescinding a 2024 Bureau of Land Management rule limiting drilling for oil in an Alaska area that is the nation’s largest tract of undisturbed public land.

“By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, said in a statement. “This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.”

According to the Alaska Wilderness League, the so-called National Petroleum Reserve is the largest single unit of public lands in the nation, spanning nearly 23m acres across Alaska’s western North Slope that was set aside in the 1920s as an emergency oil supply for the US navy.

It is home to millions of acres of wilderness with critical habitat for migratory birds, brown bears, caribou, polar bears, walrus and endangered beluga whales. The league notes that “Alaska Native communities that live in and around the reserve have maintained a subsistence lifestyle for thousands of years based on its living resources”.

Victoria Bekiempis

While Donald Trump’s justice department has downplayed the possibility that other men were involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of teen girls, an email released on 12 November as part of the House oversight committee’s Epstein investigation shows an exchange between the late financier and an associate where they discuss “girls” and travel.

Epstein sent an email asking “what is your schedule?” on 23 July 2010 to an associate. The latter responded the next morning saying: “the other girl name is [redacted].” The Guardian is withholding the associate’s name, as attempts to identify and contact him were unsuccessful.

That afternoon, the associate also wrote: “Can you call me/ I am with tigrane he would like to meet you he is here with me in Ibiza/with 8 top girls he said he would like to build some thing with you/can you come to Ibiza we have a huge house or how can we orgnise this/ meeting even Jean Luc could doo a great biz also/ he has the most amizing top models on stand by I told him not to do any/deals with anybody before he meet with you.” The Guardian could not identify the figure referred to as “tigrane”.

“He stoped working with IMG and Trump wi here please call me and let me/ know what is your plans/ warmest regards” the associate wrote, apparently referring to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent and friend of Epstein.

Epstein wrote “i will be in paris tom000rw night” in the chain.

Pentagon intelligence analysis calls sale of F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia risky – report

As Donald Trump prepares to host Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, next week, Pentagon intelligence officials are warning that a deal to let US arms makers sell 48 F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis could give China access to the technology, the New York Times reports.

Pentagon officials told the paper that they fear “that F-35 technology could be compromised through Chinese espionage or China’s security partnership with Saudi Arabia”. The concerns were detailed in a report from the Defense Intelligence Agency, a part of the defense department.

Three weeks after Trump, reluctantly, left office in 2021, US intelligence agencies concluded that the crown prince, known as MBS, “approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi” and noted “the Crown Prince’s support for using violent measures to silence dissidents abroad”.

That intelligence assessment prompted then president Joe Biden to keep his distance from the Saudi leader during his first months in office, before dismaying human rights advocates by softening that stance later in his term, initially with a friendly fist-bump instead of a handshake. the crown prince to . Trump, in marked contrast, has warmly embraced the crown prince. During his visit to the Middle East in May, Trump effusively praised the crown prince in public remarks.

BBC apologizes to Trump for Panorama documentary, but rejects demands for compensation

My colleagues, Tara Conlan and Michael Savage, report that the BBC has apologised to Donald Trump over the editing of a Panorama that led to the resignation of its director general, Tim Davie, and the BBC News chief, Deborah Turness.

However, the corporation has rejected his demands for compensation, after lawyers for Trump threatened to sue for $1bn in damages unless the BBC issued a retraction, apologised and settled with him.

The BBC has also agreed not to show the edition of Panorama again.

“Lawyers for the BBC have written to president Trump’s legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday,” a BBC spokesperson said.

“BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president’s speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program.

“The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary Trump: A Second Chance? On any BBC platforms. While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”

Here's a recap of the day so far

The Trump administration is suing California governor Gavin Newsom after the state adopted new congressional maps last week. The justice department joined a lawsuit, brought by California Republicans, to block the new boundaries that voters overwhelmingly approved through Proposition 50 – a ballot initiative that would give Democrats in the Golden state five more seats in the House ahead of the 2026 midterms. This was the governor’s response to the redistricting battle that started in Texas, when the state’s GOP-run legislature gerrymandered their own map.

The federal government reopened today, after a record-breaking shutdown that lasted almost 43 days. Several agencies called their employees back to work, and the administration expects back pay to be issued to furloughed employees by early next week. Earlier, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that the shutdown cost “$15bn a week”, and cited an estimate that 60,000 non-federal workers lost their jobs.

The White House remains on defense after a trove of documents from the Epstein estate seemed to suggest that Donald Trump knew about the late-financier’s conduct. Press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that the latest tranche of emails – one of which said that Trump “spent hours” at Epstein’s home, and another which said the president “knew about the girls” – is part of a Democratic “hoax’ to distract “from the President’s wins”.

A federal judge in Virginia said she would rule by Thanksgiving in a case brought by former FBI director James Comey and New York attorney general Letitia James – that alleges the prosecutor who indicted them was unlawfully appointed. Attorneys for the former FBI director and New York attorney general claim that Lindsey Halligan, who Donald Trump handpicked to be the new US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was illegally installed because her role in office exceeds the 120-day for a role to filled by an interim appointee without confirmation from the Senate.

John Fetterman, the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, has been hospitalized after a fall during an early morning walk. According to his spokesperson, “out of an abundance of caution” he was “transported to a hospital in Pittsburgh”. Fetterman was one of the lawmakers in the Democratic caucus who split from the party to vote for the bill to reopen the federal government. “Upon evaluation, it was established he had a ventricular fibrillation flare-up that led to Senator Fetterman feeling light-headed, falling to the ground and hitting his face with minor injuries,” his spokesperson added.

Trump administration to sue Gavin Newsom over California's new redistricting maps

The Trump administration is suing California governor Gavin Newsom after the state adopted new congressional maps last week.

The justice department is attempting to block the new boundaries, that voters overwhelmingly approved through Proposition 50 – the ballot initiative that would give Democrats in the Golden state five more seats in the House ahead of the 2026 midterms. This move was a response to the redistricting battle that started in Texas, when the state’s GOP-run legislature gerrymandered their own maps.

Attorney general Pam Bondi called the governor’s effort a “power grab”.

“Newsom should be concerned about keeping Californians safe and shutting down Antifa violence, not rigging his state for political gain,” she added.

Trump to sign executive order to help foster children transition to adulthood

Right now, we’re hearing from first lady Melania Trump as the president prepares to sign an executive order to help foster children access employment and education opportunities as they age out of the system.

“This executive order, fostering the future for American children and families, gives me tremendous pride. It is both empathetic and strategic. It will certainly be impactful,” she said.

Federal judge will issue ruling on whether prosecutor was appointed unlawfully by end of the month

A federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia said she would rule by Thanksgiving in a case brought by James Comey and Letitia James – that alleges the prosecutor charging them was unlawfully appointed. During today’s hearing, judge Cameron Currie did not issue a decision during the hour-long court hearing, but said she would probably rule by the end of the month.

Attorneys for the former FBI director and New York attorney general claim that Lindsey Halligan, who Donald Trump handpicked to be the new US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was illegally installed because her role in office exceeds the 120-day for a role to filled by an interim appointee without confirmation from the Senate. Her predecessor, Erik Siebert, was also a temporary US attorney before he resigned from his position, stating he found insufficient evidence to prosecute Trump’s political enemies.

Continuing to support freedom advocates like Rushan Abbas is essential to advancing United States global leadership.","Rushan Abbas, co-founder and director of the organization Campaign for Uyghurs, was honored with the 2025 Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) this November. This award recognizes the work of individuals and organizations to advance human rights and democracy around the globe.

Abbas co-founded Campaign for Uyghurs in 2017, with the goal of promoting and defending the human rights and democratic freedoms of the Uyghur people. The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim minority ethnic group native to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwestern China.

In 2014, the People’s Republic of China launched a campaign against what they referred to as “violent extremism” and international terrorism. While at face value this sounds like a reasonable policy, it was used instead as a pretext to introduce pervasive restrictions and human rights violations on minorities residing within the Xinjiang region. Several nations, including the United States, declared that China’s actions amounted to genocide against the Uyghurs. They cited evidence of forced labor, suppression of religious and cultural practices, and involuntary sterilization – all of which Beijing denied.

Abbas spoke at a panel in 2018 about these human rights violations and the ongoing mass detention of Uyghurs in “reeducation” camps. Six days later, the Chinese regime took her sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, from her home in the Xinjiang region in retaliation. She has remained in detention since. This event prompted Rushan to fully commit to activism, working to raise awareness of the Uyghur genocide and the systemic human rights abuses Uyghurs continue to face residing in China.

Led by Abbas, Campaign for Uyghurs has been at the forefront of the fight for the rights of the Uyghur people and has played a pivotal role in advocating for international involvement. The tireless work of Abbas and her organization was instrumental in the passage of key Congressional acts, including the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which imposes sanctions on individuals and organizations that are responsible for human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang region.

Campaign for Uyghurs and Rushan Abbas have worked relentlessly to protect and defend the rights of Uyghur people in China and in the diaspora. Their work has been recognized by the human rights community multiple times, including nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize and being awarded the World Democracy Courage Tribute in July of 2021.

Through advocacy programs to mobilize the international community, exposing Beijing’s atrocities, and empowering the Uyghur diaspora to lead change, Rushan Abbas and Campaign for Uyghurs are working to protect the human rights and liberties of Uyghurs everywhere. By advocating for human rights abroad, the United States can continue to ensure the protection of American interests and promote democracy around the world.

“These ICE flights represent a system operating in darkness,” said Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First. “People are disappearing, deported to countries where they face persecution, or sent to places they’ve never lived—all without transparency or due process.”

The report highlights several alarming trends: forced third-country transfers to nations where individuals deported are not citizens, deportations carried out in violation of court orders (including the removal of an Alabama father protected by a court order) or due to administrative errors, and the growing use of punitive and inhumane conditions aboard ICE charter flights.

“Many passengers are shackled at the wrists, waist, and ankles—and at times even the full-body WRAP—for journeys that can last over 40 hours with multiple layovers and fuel stops.” Arvey continued. ICE Flight Monitor’s mission is to bring transparency to this system, hold the government accountable for abuses, and ensure that the human cost of these policies is not hidden from public view.”

On Thursday, Diana Santillana Galeano’s attorney said she was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Clay county, Indiana, on Wednesday night. Her release followed a federal judge’s ruling earlier in the day that her arrest was “unlawful” as she had not had a preliminary bond hearing.

In his ruling on Wednesday, US district judge Jeremy Daniel wrote: “The government acknowledges that several courts, including this one, have found mandatory detention … unlawful.” He ordered the government to provide Galeano with a bond hearing by 18 November.

Daniel further added that “the parties shall submit a status report on or before November 20, 2025, that addresses the petitioner’s release status, including when the petitioner received a bond hearing, the result of the bond hearing, and any findings made by the immigration judge.”

Following her release, Galeano said in a statement: “I am so grateful to everyone who has advocated on my behalf, and on behalf of the countless others who have experienced similar trauma over recent months in the Chicago area … I love our community and the children I teach, and I can’t wait to see them again.”

Meanwhile, Galeano’s lawyers hailed the court’s ruling, saying: “The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely. This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs,” the Chicago Tribune reported.

Galeano’s arrest last week sparked widespread outrage after federal agents were caught on video dragging her out of the Rayito de Sol daycare center in Chicago’s North Side.

At one point, the agents appeared to slam her face against the daycare’s glass doors before pinning her against a parked car and handcuffing her. Witnesses reported hearing Galeano say in Spanish “I have papers,” adding that the arrest unfolded in front of children.

City and state lawmakers had quickly denounced Galeano’s arrest, which came amid ICE’s “Operation Midway Blitz”, a series of aggressive immigration crackdowns that have swept across the Chicago area in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, Tricia McLaughlin, the homeland security department spokesperson, denied last week that the daycare itself had been targeted, saying instead: “Officers attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop of this female illegal alien from Colombia.”

“Do legal immigrants enrich America or damage it?” the Wall Street Journal editorial board asked in its lead editorial today, which is worth reading in its entirety.
“For all of his campaigning against illegal immigration, Mr. Trump understands that America needs the world’s strivers to continue to prosper,” writes the Journal’s editorial board.
Trump seems to recognize it is self-destructive to train these students and then send them back to India or China instead of building firms here.” A steady flow of legal immigration has been a reliable source of US renewal for more than two centuries.","I’m the son of German immigrants who arrived in the United States with little more than their aspirations and their formidable work ethic. So, I’ve been monitoring the Trump administration’s approach to both illegal and legal immigration with a first-generation American’s interest—and a patriot’s conviction that our history has been written by successive waves of immigrants.

What’s positive is that illegal immigration has fallen dramatically. Illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border are down by some 95 percent from peak levels seen during the Biden administration. This decrease is due to strict new policies, tough enforcement, and the reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration court proceedings.

What’s less positive is a souring mood toward legal immigrants, including charging $100,000 for an H-1B visa. “Do legal immigrants enrich America or damage it?” the Wall Street Journal editorial board asked in its lead editorial today, which is worth reading in its entirety. “That’s one of the debates now emerging on the political right, including it seems even in the White House.” The Journal’s editorial board notes that President Donald Trump this week spoke to Laura Ingraham on Fox News in favor of embracing skilled foreign workers, while Vice President JD Vance has signaled that he’d favor far fewer of them.

“For all of his campaigning against illegal immigration, Mr. Trump understands that America needs the world’s strivers to continue to prosper,” writes the Journal’s editorial board. “Perhaps he can make that case to his young apprentice.”

Those who are skeptical about large numbers of legal immigrants suggest these newcomers take Americans’ jobs, undermine social cohesion, and dilute American identity. These concerns are as old as the United States, and they were raised regarding previous waves of Germans, Irish, Italians, Eastern Europeans, and Asians. Time has always proved these concerns wrong.

My parents arrived before World War II and amid the Great Depression and its aftermath, first as outsiders and then as participants in a national project bigger than any of us. Their story wasn’t exceptional. Millions of families—today’s engineers from India, doctors and nurses from East Asia, African entrepreneurs, young Latin American graduates across any number of fields—are contributing to that same project.

When Google CEO Sundar Pichai accepted the Atlantic Council Global Citizen Award in 2022, he said, “More than twenty years ago, I immigrated to the US. When I arrived, I was met with open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance, all of which helped ease my path. Looking back on that period of my life, what I remember most are the people who made me feel welcome. Because of them, I started to feel as much a part of this country as I did growing up in India.”

Every generation of Americans has faced some version of this immigration argument since the revolution that created our country almost 250 years ago. If anything, the stakes now are higher. If the United States wants to stay competitive in an era of artificial intelligence, demographic decline, and intensified geopolitical rivalry with China, then the country will need more of what has always made America great.

“A quarter of billion-dollar U.S. startups were founded by an immigrant who arrived as an international student,” the Journal’s editorial board writes. “Mr. Trump seems to recognize it is self-destructive to train these students and then send them back to India or China instead of building firms here.”

A steady flow of legal immigration has been a reliable source of US renewal for more than two centuries. It helped assure US dynamism after World War II, it contributed to the explosion of Silicon Valley, and it will help ensure our national resilience as we face an inflection point made up of ever-changing economic, technological, and geopolitical challenges.

History’s lesson here is a clear one. The Trump administration’s embrace of these newcomers will further strengthen America.

Border security and the future of DHS: Will Trump 2.0 earn the public’s trust?

New Atlanticist By Thomas S. Warrick

The incoming US president has promised mass deportations, but there are three circumstances that could erode public support for the plans.

DENVER | A more-than-decade-old case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday against Aurora’s privately run immigration detention center. The original lawsuit was filed by a former detainee of the ICE detention facility, Alejandro Menocal, in 2014.

According to Menocal, who was held at the detention center for four months, he and other detainees were forced to do manual labor for $1 a day and were threatened with solitary confinement if they refused.

“Every day I would wake up at 5 a.m. to set up to serve meals,” he told CPR News in an interview in 2014. “And then I would hand out brooms, mops, cleaning supplies to the detainees… Detainees cleaned out moldy showers, detainees cut hair, detainees cleaned the cells where we were housed, detainees did the outside maintenance in the yard.”

Menocal filed the original lawsuit, alongside eight other former detainees, against The GEO Group, Inc., the private prison company that runs the Aurora ICE detention center.

But GEO — which is one of the nation’s largest private prison companies and has profited from the Trump administration’s immigration policies — argued it is immune from the lawsuit because it was acting as a federal contractor. However, lawyers for the detainees argued federal immunity does not extend to acts the federal government did not request or order. Meanwhile, the original suit has been delayed while the courts have taken up the question of immunity.

The company’s position relies on the centuries-old doctrine of “sovereign immunity,” which generally shields the federal government from certain lawsuits. In recent years, some contractors have sought to extend that protection to themselves.

Jennifer Dale Bennett, the attorney representing the detainees, disputed GEO’s claim. “GEO is asking the Supreme Court to grant private contractors the right to tie up lawsuits in endless, meritless appeals,” Bennett said in a statement to CPR News. “We’re hopeful that the Court will reject GEO’s attempt to avoid accountability.”

During oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of GEO’s defense.

“You’re just asking for a blanket no liability for contractors who are following the government’s instructions,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told an attorney representing the company.

That skepticism was echoed outside the courtroom. Andrew Schwartz, a law professor at University of Colorado Law School, said GEO faces a difficult legal path.

“GEO faces an uphill battle to convince the Supreme Court that their defense to this lawsuit is the sort of thing that must be immediately appealable and cannot wait until final judgment,” he said.

Schwartz added that the Supreme Court’s eventual decision could be influenced by Congress, noting that the justices’ ruling is “ultimately subject to congressional approval or disapproval.” If lawmakers believe federal contractors should be allowed to immediately appeal rulings that go against them, he said, Congress could pass a new statute to make that possible.

But for now, Schwartz noted, the Supreme Court case has effectively put the underlying lawsuit on hold. The procedural fight has taken center stage — overshadowing the central claims that detainees were compelled to work for minimal pay under threat of punishment.",https://sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WEBAP_17172779774468.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 20:57:44.882692

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August.
CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month.
Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits.
“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges.","Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections.

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_calcity-detention_mv_cm_121763070352.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=smxXSJdg,N,,2025-11-13 16:58:19.433998

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A judge declined Thursday to throw out the criminal case against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting federal agents during a chaotic visit last spring to an immigration detention center in New Jersey.

McIver’s lawyers had argued that the prosecution was selective and vindictive, and that the New Jersey Democrat hadn’t assaulted anyone during her May 9 trip to Delaney Hall detention center in Newark. They also said McIver was performing legislative duties protected by the Constitution when she showed up to inspect the detention center, and was thus immune from prosecution.

U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper wrote that McIver failed to show the prosecution was vindictive and that her actions were “wholly disconnected” from the oversight she was conducting as a member of Congress.

The judge didn’t reach a decision yet on another of one of the congresswoman’s motions to toss the charges.

McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, said in an emailed statement that he believed the court’s decision was wrong.

“It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side,” Fishman said.

The case is a high-profile clash between Trump’s second administration and a Democratic lawmaker who has been sharply critical of the president’s policies. McIver has pleaded not guilty and vowed to continue her work as a lawmaker.

The acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, brought the case. Her tenure overseeing federal prosecutors in New Jersey is separately being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case and a decision pending.

McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.

Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility, was the site of raucous protests last spring.

McIver was among several elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who attempted to visit the facility in May. As they tried to gain access, Baraka was arrested by federal agents. McIver was among several people jostling in the crowd of people around Baraka as it happened.

Prosecutors claim McIver “slammed” her forearm into an agent and placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest.

It is not clear from police body camera video if the contact with the agent was intentional or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The judge’s opinion on Wednesday cites video footage and says McIver pushed and was pushed during the incident.

A trespassing charge against the mayor was later dropped.

Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority.

McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Immigration_Protest_New_Jersey_77084.jpg?w=1024&h=685,N,,2025-11-13 20:57:36.842030

The complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump. It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who’s seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender.

“California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”

California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year’s midterm elections.

The Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.

“Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 — the recent ballot initiative that junked California’s pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California’s congressional district lines,” the lawsuit says.

Prop 50 was Newsom’s response to Trump’s maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line.

Democrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Trump’s agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats’ 214.

The showdown between the nation’s two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri, Ohio and a spray of other states either adopting new district lines to gain partisan advantage or considering to do so.

The national implications of California’s ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Former action movie star and Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger opposed it, while former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared in ads supporting it, calling it a “smart” approach to counter Republican moves aimed at safeguarding House control.

The contest provided Newsom with a national platform when he has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028.

She shared documents with ABC 15 showing that her father had been going to Stay of Removal immigration hearings for more than a decade and was always approved to stay in the country.

He always showed up for his court hearings. Every year that they asked him to show up, he would bring his application of the stay of removal. They always accepted it,"" she said.

However, she said, when her father went to a hearing in August in Charleston, something felt different.

That was his court hearing that he had to show up. That's the part that changed his life. They had him after his court; they sent him to an office in North Charleston. And that's when they put an ankle monitor on him. And he had that for about three months. And it was really hard for him because they made him feel like a criminal. Like I said, my dad is not a criminal. He did everything right. He paid his government taxes. Did everything right. Like I said, it's just unfair. What they're doing to him,"" said Castillo.

She said her father felt very ashamed and embarrassed by wearing the ankle monitor, because he'd done nothing wrong.

""He even cooperated in that. It was really hard, challenging for him because he would wake up in the middle of the night worried if the battery was was, dying, so he had to change the battery. They only gave him two batteries. He felt embarrassed. Because he thought he was, He really. They made him feel he was a criminal. But, I promise he is a sweet, hardworking man. And I'm glad to call him my father.""

She added that her father was allowed to come back home following a hearing in September, but the hearing in October led to him being deported to Mexico.

From November 6 that we didn't do that whole day. We didn't hear about him until November 7, that night. So it was almost two days. It was days full of misery because that night on November 7th, he called us and told us that I had taken him directly to Mexico. So ICE lied to us. And, we feel that what they did was very wrong. They made us go through so much pain. Not knowing nothing, anything about him, whether if he was okay or something had happened to him. Because we were really, extremely anxious because we heard at the detention in Louisiana, they mistreat them, and they can go days without communicating with their families. And so, even so when when we found out that they had to take him to Mexico, he was in pain. He was, he couldn't believe what was going on here because he's in Mexico, and then we're here.""

Castillo said her father pleaded with ICE to allow him to remain in the country because he has five children in Florence, and one of them has a severe medical condition affecting his brain.

She added that they even provided medical records to ICE officials, with a doctor's statement urging them to allow Castillo to be with his son.

She said they've talked with her father since he's been in Mexico, but he longs to be with his family here in Florence.

We are not numbers. We are people who love someone who's being treated as if they don't belong here. And my dad does belong here. And I'm going to keep speaking up until he's home,"" she said.

She hopes her younger brothers will be able to visit their father next month.

The two brothers, both in their late teens, were ordered released on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the court granted release to a third young immigrant in the same age group who, like the brothers, entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and later applied for SIJS, a pathway toward permanent legal protection.

“These young brothers came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and cannot safely return to their home countries after it was determined that they were abused, abandoned, or neglected,” said ACLU of Virginia Legal Director Eden Heilman in a statement.

“Federal law says they have every legal right to be in the United States, and that ICE should never have put them in a detention center. Now they will finally be freed from detention and reunited with each other.”

ICE has not commented publicly on the Virginia rulings, and agency representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A legal pathway ignored

Congress almost four decades ago created SIJS to give vulnerable children a path toward lawful permanent residency. The process requires a state court to determine that the child cannot safely return to their country of origin, followed by a visa application and, eventually, an adjustment to citizenship.

Those granted or applying for SIJS are not typically subject to mandatory detention.

Yet, the class-action complaint, filed in October by the ACLU of Virginia and partner counsel in the Alexandria Division of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, contends that ICE, under current policies, is treating SIJS-eligible youth as “arriving noncitizens” who must be detained without bond — despite protections under anti-trafficking laws, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the U.S. Constitution.

“Our clients are following the rules they’ve been given to obtain citizenship. The federal judge’s ruling confirmed that ICE is not,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg. “By ignoring the legal process Congress established decades ago, ICE is causing the very chaos and confusion that the Trump administration claims it’s working to fix.”

The federal judge’s order requires ICE to provide bond hearings to the named plaintiffs and bars the government from denying bond or invoking automatic stays if bond is granted.

The immigration court’s Tuesday order released the two brothers, both of whom arrived in the U.S. as minors and have SIJS applications or approvals. They were being held at the Caroline Detention Facility and the Farmville Detention Facility, both of which typically house adults.

On Wednesday, the court ordered a third plaintiff released — another client of the ACLU-VA who also entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and is eligible for SIJS protections. That ruling marked at least the second time this week the court rejected ICE’s argument that SIJS-eligible youth may be detained without bond.

A broader trend

Virginia’s case reflects a nationwide surge of litigation over ICE’s increasingly aggressive detention of immigrants — including youth with protected statuses — without access to bond hearings. For example, in Massachusetts, a federal judge recently certified a class action challenging denials of bond hearings to immigrants held without inspection.

In New Bedford, Mass., a judge last month ordered the release of an 18-year-old SIJS recipient held in a county facility despite his protected status.

A July 2025 memo from ICE declared that undocumented immigrants who entered without inspection could be detained throughout their removal proceedings — often months or years — without access to bond hearings.

“These cases show the growing force of legal challenges to ICE’s detention practices,” the Amica Center wrote after a separate court ruling this fall.

What’s at stake

Over the summer, immigration‐enforcement tactics in Virginia spurred widespread public protest.

Dozens gathered outside rallies organized by the Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality, calling for an end to local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement following a wave of “masked, unmarked” detentions in the region.

In June and July, activists confronted courthouse raids in Chesterfield County and other sites, decrying what they described as “abduction-style” arrests of immigrants — many without criminal records. These protests underscored mounting local resistance as Virginia communities grapple with the human impact of enforcement policies.

For the three young immigrants now ordered released, the rulings mean freedom from detention and the chance to continue the SIJS process outside a jail setting.

But the broader class-action lawsuit remains in early stages, and thousands of other SIJS-eligible youth nationwide remain subject to detention policies advocates say misinterpret federal law.

Advocates warn that prolonged detention can inflict long-term psychological harm on young people who have already survived trauma. Courts across the country are increasingly being asked to determine whether the lack of bond access violates due-process guarantees for youth whose presence in the U.S. is legally protected.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4242-2048x1477.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 14:57:30.541253

A federal judge is expected to consider whether to hold the city of Los Angeles in contempt of court for allegedly failing to keep up with its obligations in an agreement to provide shelter for unhoused residents.

Why now: U.S. District Judge David O. Carter scheduled a hearing for next week after meeting in court Wednesday with representatives from the city and a group of downtown business and property owners known as the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights.

The occasionally tense meeting was the latest to gauge progress in a long-running legal settlement over the city’s response to the homelessness crisis.

Carter set the contempt hearing for next Wednesday, giving city officials time to produce documents the court has requested and for both sides to subpoena witnesses, potentially including L.A. Mayor Karen Bass.

How we got here: During the hearing, Carter pointed to several delays attributed to city authorities.

For example, the monitor the judge appointed recently to help to make sure the city stayed on track under the settlement said he had trouble setting up interviews with city employees.

The monitor, Daniel Garrie, reported in court documents that he was told to refer all requests to the city’s attorneys, which he said “slowed progress.”

The judge warned that failure to comply with his orders could “result in sanctions” for the city.

What the attorneys say: Elizabeth Mitchell, lead attorney for L.A. Alliance, told LAist the court made clear there had been a lack of transparency from L.A. officials.

“I think the city has made it a pattern and practice of obfuscating, delaying, avoiding accountability and really fulfilling its obligations,” Mitchell said after the hearing. “They're spending a tremendous amount of effort and money to avoid their obligations.”

Bradley Hamburger, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher , the law firm representing the city, declined LAist’s request for comment after the hearing.

What's next: Carter set the contempt hearing to start Nov. 19 at 9 a.m.

Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections .

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”

California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday.

The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.

""After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,"" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. ""This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.""

Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.

Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.

""Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,"" Richards said.

Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.

Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.

Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.

The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.

Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after.

Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is officially over after President Trump signed a bill passed by Congress on Wednesday night.

The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger.

And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30.

Here's a look at where things stand for now.

Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay

Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed.

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday.

""Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner"" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a Wednesday memo .

The timing of backpay is a different question.

After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress passed a law ensuring back pay for federal workers ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.""

But Trump appeared to suggest otherwise in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried.

The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were paused by a federal judge , and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January.

Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an Instagram video that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days.

""Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,"" he says of the last shutdown. ""A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.""

SNAP is back

The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026.

The program, which some 42 million Americans rely on for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges.

While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and extended that pause again on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight).

At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as NPR has reported , many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again.

Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis

The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual.

Its website says the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday.

All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved live animal cams — will reopen to the public ""on a rolling basis"" by Monday.

This is a live story that will be updated throughout the day as we learn more.

The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.","Before he got a call this week from CNN about reports US Border Patrol agents might be headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, City Councilmember Malcom Graham had no idea such a plan was even in the cards.

None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday about the reported move were aware of any plan for Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities, and his officers to head to Charlotte, then New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.

As of Thursday morning, Bovino has left Chicago with his agents and is headed to Charlotte, according to a source familiar with the planning.

“As of right now, there has been no coordination, no confirmation, no conversation from anybody. So we’re just kind of watching and waiting,” Graham, a Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday. “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”

The swirling rumors have put Charlotte on edge, as local officials seek to reassure residents they will be protected, even as they hold their breath, waiting to see whether they’ll be the next target in the White House’s high-profile, visibly aggressive push to send federal agents into blue cities as part of its immigration crackdown.

“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN in a statement Thursday.

On Tuesday, McLaughlin had told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”

Neither the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations or been in contact with federal officials regarding the reported move.

Charlotte’s city police department doesn’t participate in ICE operations and would only get involved when there are criminal behavior or warrants under its jurisdiction, Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, said in a social media statement.

Residents are already on edge

Officials in other cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which deploys tactics that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led localities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.

Heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including some among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.

Rumors are already flying in Charlotte, and even though there’s no official confirmation of Bovino’s operation in the city, just the possibility has a community already on edge spooked.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that offers legal counsel to immigrants, told CNN Wednesday it is already receiving reports from frightened residents who believe they may have spotted Border Patrol in the city, though the organization said it has not verified any of those sightings.

“We’re getting ready. We’re retraining our ICE verifiers and uplifting our ICE verification network right now,” said Stefania Arteaga, the organization’s co-executive director.

“The fear is there. People are seeing viral videos of children getting pepper sprayed,” said Arteaga. “These are images that are going viral in our communities. There is fear that this could come to Charlotte.”

The sometimes violent, viral images from other cities, coupled with an increased immigration enforcement locally this year has created a chilling effect in Charlotte, City Councilmember Dimple Ajmera said.

North Carolina’s foreign-born population has increased eightfold since 1990, according to state data.

“We have more than 150,000 foreign-born residents who call our city their home,” Ajmera told CNN. “Real anxiety and fear are in our communities. Bakeries and coffee shops are empty. Children are not being sent to school.”

Local officials are in the dark

Ajmera also told CNN that federal officials hadn’t yet coordinated with the city, saying, “We are probably going to find out at the same time the community finds out.”

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, told reporters after an unrelated event in Charlotte on Wednesday afternoon that he’d reached out the White House after seeing reports in the media, but “we have not heard from them, so we don’t know what their plans are.”

The governor acknowledged he was concerned by some of the images that came out of the operation in Chicago.

“We don’t know what their plans are here for Charlotte. If they come in and they are targeted in what they do, we will thank them. If they come in and wreak havoc and cause chaos and fear, we will be very concerned,” he said.

State Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat representing Charlotte, called the potential operation in his city “political theater.”

The lone Republican who will sit on the city council next year, after Democrats flipped a GOP seat in this month’s election, told CNN undocumented immigrants who commit crimes should be deported, and the country needs a process to identify illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes and “where appropriate, establish a legal basis for their presence in this country.”

“CBP operations in any community should be coordinated with state and local authorities to avoid anxiety and disruption among legal residents,” Ed Driggs told CNN.

Why would CBP head to Charlotte?

Charlotte hasn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump Administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago, Los Angeles or even New Orleans.

And while other cities Trump has targeted with his immigration crackdown are closer to US borders, Charlotte is hundreds of miles away from both the northern and southern edges of the country.

But it is one of the places that Trump has focused on in recent months as part of his crusade against crime in populous, Democratic-run cities.

Intense public outrage swept across the country earlier this year after chilling surveillance video was released showing a young, Ukrainian refugee, Iryna Zarutska, being stabbed to death on the city’s light rail train by a suspect who had a lengthy criminal history and documented mental health struggles.

Trump posted about the stabbing on Truth Social, criticizing Democratic policies and promoting Republican candidate in next year’s closely watched Senate race.

“North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER, and only Republicans will deliver it!” he wrote.

Though the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department has said data shows the city has seen a reduction in violent crime this year, three Republican members of Congress representing districts around the Charlotte area asked the governor just this month to send the National Guard to Charlotte to help curb crime, highlighting a spike in homicides in the city’s uptown area.

And Bovino himself will be in familiar ground if he finds himself in Charlotte: He is originally from western North Carolina, graduated from Watauga High School and has degrees from Western Carolina University and Appalachian State University.

On October 14, Bovino responded to an account on X that said they hoped Bovino’s team would visit the North Carolina city.

“We’ll put Charlotte on the list!!!” Bovino wrote.

Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.

“We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”

What have local officials said about federal immigration enforcement previously?

State Republican leadership has long targeted Charlotte and Mecklenburg County’s approach to immigration enforcement. Though Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” it does claim it is a “Certified Welcoming City,” a formal designation for cities with commitment to immigrant inclusion.

Shortly after taking office in 2018, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decade-long 287(g) partnership with ICE, which allows local and state law enforcement to perform some immigration enforcement duties. McFadden was also an outspoken opponent of a new state law that expanded ICE authorities over people detained in local jails and required sheriffs to work more closely with ICE officials. That law went into effect in October after the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Stein’s veto.

A few weeks ago, McFadden announced that he’d had a “productive” meeting with ICE officials where they discussed how to “establish a better working relationship” and improve communications, along with courthouse procedures.

“I don’t want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.

Arteaga, of the Carolina Migrant Network, said her organization has observed a significant spike in ICE activity around the Charlotte area since the start of the year and a further increase in activity since the new law went into effect last month.

Charlotte’s local officials weren’t the only ones caught off guard

Charlotte isn’t the only city where officials say they’ve been kept in the dark before an operation like this might begin. The situation in Charlotte right now mirrors, in a more muted manner, the reaction from local officials in Chicago before “Operation Midway Blitz” began there.

In August, CNN reported that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the administration had failed to contact his office or the mayor, ahead of what was then the reported deployment, and he slammed the lack of coordination.

The New Orleans Mayor’s Office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.

Stein noted that Border Patrol “has national jurisdiction so there is nothing that we could do, even if we were to want to, to stop them from coming. We’re just going to have to see what their plans are. We want to hear from them so we can plan accordingly.”

Washington DC – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with U.S. Reps. Suzanne Bonamici and Val Hoyle said today they are demanding the Trump administration answer questions about reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has relocated an essential Coast Guard helicopter away from Newport, and is planning to build an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in this small Oregon Coast town.

“We urge you to immediately provide the Oregon congressional delegation and state and local officials with a clear explanation of DHS’s actions and intentions in Newport,” the Oregon lawmakers wrote DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “Reassigning Coast Guard assets or establishing ICE facilities in Newport would be deeply misguided and should not move forward without full transparency and consultation with local officials.”

Wyden, Merkley, Bonamici, and Hoyle noted in their letter that the Coast Guard station in Newport serves the city and the central Oregon Coast as a critical lifeline for the state’s fishing industry, coastal visitors, and local residents with boat crews and a MH-65 Dolphin helicopter aircrew that has long been a proven lifesaver in search and rescue operations.

“Oregonians at the local, state, and federal level have fought long and hard to preserve this crucial part of our coastal safety net, which is why we are so deeply concerned to hear reports that DHS has relocated this helicopter without any notice to our communities,” they wrote Noem. “This move endangers all those at sea, and will certainly undermine search and rescue operations, particularly ahead of crabbing season.”

The Oregon lawmakers also sought answers in their letter to persistent reports and rumors that DHS is working to move Coast Guard assets away from Newport to make room for immigration enforcement operations. It appears ICE is looking to install a detention facility or outpost in Newport, as part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to ramp up immigration enforcement.

“ICE has already rounded up law-abiding members of our communities who present no threat to public safety, which has created fear among Oregon families,” ellos escribieron. “Newport residents and small business owners remain extremely concerned about the social and economic consequences that will result from ICE enhancing its presence in the town and the surrounding areas.”

In addition to requesting a briefing from Noem as soon as possible, the Oregon lawmakers also asked Noem to provide written responses by November 14, 2025, to the following questions:

Did DHS direct, approve, or initiate the reassignment of any Coast Guard assets or personnel from Newport?

Has DHS or ICE proposed, authorized, or taken any steps toward establishing an ICE detention facility or expanding immigration enforcement activities in Newport?

Why did DHS not consult with Oregon state and local officials before making or considering these reported changes, and when will such consultation occur?

The policy expands health-related grounds for visa denial, naming chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer as potential reasons for refusal. This development impacts millions of visa applicants worldwide, altering the criteria consular officers use to assess admissibility. This analysis explores the implications of the policy on global mobility, the complex intersections of health and immigration law, and the rights of affected individuals.

Expansion of Health Grounds for Visa Denial

Historically, U.S. visa medical exams concentrated primarily on communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and proof of vaccination. However, the newly issued guidelines explicitly include chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, metastatic cancer, and serious mental health disorders as red-flag medical issues, signaling that visa officers should assess the likelihood that applicants could impose ""substantial long-term costs"" on U.S. public health resources.​

These conditions are no longer peripheral considerations but central to the evaluation of whether an applicant may become a ""public charge,"" a legal standard assessing if an immigrant is likely to rely on government assistance. The expanded definition includes metabolic, neurological, respiratory, and oncological diseases as well, encompassing a broad array of common chronic illnesses.​

The policy entrusts consular officers with broad discretion to demand additional financial guarantees, deny visas outright, or prolong administrative processing unless applicants demonstrate adequate private health insurance coverage extendable within the United States. This discretion now covers applicants for both immigrant and non-immigrant visas, including business travelers and international students, representing a drastic expansion from past practice.​

Statements by Stakeholders

From policymaker perspectives,

""The leadership has given consulates 'broad authority' to reject applications based on common medical conditions, which have never been considered grounds for refusal in themselves"",

as stated by a U.S. State Department official. This reflects an administrative aim to safeguard American public health and reduce federal healthcare expenditure by preempting the admission of potential long-term medical care burdens.​

However, immigration lawyers and human rights advocates have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the policy could lead to discriminatory practices and arbitrary decisions, especially given visa officers' lack of medical training to assess chronic illness severity or treatment costs accurately. Many organizations assert that these decisions risk violating U.S. anti-discrimination laws and international disability rights conventions, given that chronic diseases are widespread and manageable in many cases.​

Human rights groups emphasize that denying visas on the basis of these medical conditions disproportionately impacts applicants from countries with high prevalence rates of these diseases—particularly those with limited healthcare infrastructure. Such policies might exacerbate inequities in mobility and access to opportunities globally. Many individuals with chronic illnesses lead productive, fulfilling lives and contribute economically and socially both in the U.S. and abroad, challenging the premise underlying the policy.​

Impact on Global Mobility

The immediate consequence of this policy is an expected increase in visa denial rates for applicants with listed medical conditions, coupled with administrative delays due to additional documentation and insurance requirements. Medical exam backlogs at consulates are likely to lengthen as visa officers navigate these new health assessments.​

Employers, especially multinational companies reliant on global talent, face increased risks and costs. They may need to allocate higher budgets to provide supplemental health insurance or consider relocating projects to countries with less restrictive entry policies. This could hamper U.S. competitiveness in attracting foreign expertise.​

Beyond economic consequences, the policy poses humanitarian concerns by restricting the movement of individuals seeking immigration or travel opportunities for education, family reunification, or employment. By framing chronic illness as a liability, the policy restricts rights to mobility and equal treatment under immigration frameworks. This risks setting a precedent for other countries to adopt similarly restrictive health-based entry rules, potentially undermining international norms around non-discrimination and freedom of movement.​

Legal and Ethical Considerations

The policy's reliance on the ""public charge"" doctrine reflects a broader administrative effort to align immigration with economic self-sufficiency. This is interpreted through Section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which historically targeted welfare dependency but now incorporates health-related cost concerns.​

Legal experts question whether this reinterpretation respects existing protections against health-based discrimination. The measure's immediate implementation without a formal rule-making process raises procedural concerns as well. Additionally, the vagueness surrounding financial burden estimations and applicant evaluations fuels fears of inconsistent application and potential injustices.​

Ethically, critics argue the policy fails to distinguish between chronic diseases that necessitate manageable care versus those requiring institutionalization. It conflates healthcare costs with worthiness to enter a country, undermining humanitarian principles and compassion in immigration policy.

Looking Forward: Balancing Health with Human Rights

Moving ahead, the U.S. government faces the challenge of balancing public health responsibilities with ensuring equitable and fair treatment of all visa applicants. Transparent guidelines, medical expert input, and safeguards against discrimination are essential to mitigate harms.

Civil society and global health advocates urge the reconsideration of overly broad criteria and call for policies accommodating the reality of chronic illness in modern life. ""Visa policies should reflect medical realities and human dignity, not economic prejudice,"" argue rights groups.​

Simultaneously, multinational employers and individuals must prepare for more complex visa processes and advocate for clarity and fairness in assessment protocols.","https://impactpolicies.org/admin/storage/photos/shares/2025/U.S.%20Visa%20Policy%20Expands%20Denials%20for%20Obesity,%20Cancer,%20Diabetes%20Impacting%20Mobility.jpg",N,,2025-11-13 14:57:22.723822

White House officials have asked her and her staff members what it would take for her to change positions.
“Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” Mr. Trump wrote.
A spokesman for Ms. Bondi declined to comment, or to say whether Ms. Bondi attended a meeting Wednesday morning at the White House with Ms. Boebert.
As of this week, none of the four Republicans had indicated that they were wavering on the Epstein petition.","President Trump and his administration on Wednesday ramped up a pressure campaign on congressional Republicans who are pushing for a full release of the Justice Department’s files about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, rushing to head off a House vote on the matter.

But even as the White House made last-ditch moves to block action, proponents of a vote reached a critical threshold to force one, winning the final signature on a petition that will require the House to bring up the matter in the coming days. By Wednesday night, Speaker Mike Johnson, who has opposed considering the measure, said he would relent and bring it to a vote next week.

It came the same day that top officials had summoned Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican who has signed the petition, to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with Attorney General Pam Bondi and the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, to discuss her demand to release the files, according to two people familiar with the matter.

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the private discussions.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, confirmed that the meeting had taken place, calling it an example of “transparency” and how administration officials “are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns.”

Ms. Boebert is one of three Republican women in the House who have signed on to the petition, which calls for a vote on a resolution demanding that the Justice Department within 30 days release all of its investigative files on Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019.

Later in the day, Representative Adelita Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat whom Republicans had avoided swearing in for nearly two months, was finally allowed to take her oath and immediately provided the final signature needed to force action on the Epstein measure.

Even if the resolution were to pass the Republican-led House, it would almost certainly be dead on arrival in the Senate, and Mr. Trump would surely veto it. But a vote on the matter could be a political disaster for him and many Republicans, who have been torn between their loyalty to Mr. Trump and the clamoring by their constituents for more transparency about Mr. Epstein. The president has lobbied intensively behind the scenes to prevent such a vote.

Mr. Trump called Ms. Boebert on the phone early Tuesday morning, according to two people familiar with the call, a day before Speaker Mike Johnson was set to swear in Ms. Grijalva, who had pledged to provide the 218th signature needed to force the Epstein vote.

Mr. Trump reached out by phone to Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, another of the Republicans who have signed the petition, according to a person familiar with the calls, but the two did not connect. Instead, Ms. Mace, who is running for governor, wrote Mr. Trump a long explanation of her own history of sexual abuse and rape, and why it was impossible for her to change positions, according to a person familiar with her actions. In a social media post, she wrote that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal.”

Ms. Boebert thanked White House officials on social media for meeting with her and wrote that “together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.” But she did not remove her name from the petition.

For months, Ms. Boebert has been the target of an unrelenting pressure campaign from the White House to remove her name. White House officials have asked her and her staff members what it would take for her to change positions. When that did not work, they issued vague threats, reminding her of the risks of crossing Mr. Trump in her district, where he remained popular.

But the hardball tactics did not have their desired effect. Instead, people familiar with Ms. Boebert’s thinking said, it caused Ms. Boebert to dig in and more seriously entertain the possibility of a real conspiracy at play to cover up what is in the Epstein files.

Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress have also sought to thwart a vote on releasing the material, in part by opening their own investigation in the House Oversight Committee into Mr. Epstein. They have argued that no legislation is needed to force the administration to cooperate since they are already looking into the matter. But that strategy, too, has failed to quiet the calls for greater transparency.

The flurry of lobbying from the White House came as Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three emails in which Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier, suggested that Mr. Trump knew more about Mr. Epstein’s abuse than he has acknowledged.

But Republicans on the oversight panel quickly sought to discredit the messages, releasing tens of thousands of other pages of documents in which they were contained in an apparent bid to downplay and shift attention away from them.

In a social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the renewed focus on what he called the “Epstein Hoax” was a tactic by Democrats to deflect blame for causing the government shutdown.

“Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” Mr. Trump wrote.

White House officials have sought to enlist Ms. Bondi and Mr. Patel in the lobbying effort directed at getting Ms. Boebert to remove her name from the discharge petition, according to people familiar with the matter.

A spokesman for Ms. Bondi declined to comment, or to say whether Ms. Bondi attended a meeting Wednesday morning at the White House with Ms. Boebert. A White House official also declined to comment.

Mr. Patel was at the White House Wednesday, where he spoke to reporters about the administration’s efforts to fight fentanyl.

Ms. Leavitt said she would not comment on conversations held in the Situation Room, normally a space reserved for handling high-level crises and military operations.

Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky are the two other Republicans who have signed the discharge petition.

As of this week, none of the four Republicans had indicated that they were wavering on the Epstein petition. At home in their districts for over a month, people who spoke to them had said, they repeatedly heard from constituents thanking them for signing their names and pleading with them to hold the line.

With Ms. Grijalva’s signature on Wednesday, the document reached the threshold to bring the Epstein resolution to the floor, freezing the petition in place and closing off the possibility that any lawmaker could remove his or her name.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12dc-boebert-01-qvlk/12dc-boebert-01-qvlk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 13:57:20.818545

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa.
But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.
Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued.
Friday, November 14, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.","California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver's licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S., state officials said Wednesday.

The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.

""After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,"" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. ""This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.""

Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.

Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.

""Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,"" Richards said.

Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.

Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.

Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.

The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.

Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after.

Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.

Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections .

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is officially over after President Trump signed a bill passed by Congress on Wednesday night.

The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger.

And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30.

Here's a look at where things stand for now.

Federal workers | SNAP | Smithsonian

Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay

Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed.

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday.

""Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner"" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a Wednesday memo .

The timing of backpay is a different question.

After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress passed a law ensuring back pay for federal workers ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.""

But Trump appeared to suggest otherwise in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried.

The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were paused by a federal judge , and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January.

Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an Instagram video that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days.

""Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,"" he says of the last shutdown. ""A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.""

SNAP is back

The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026.

The program, which some 42 million Americans rely on for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges.

While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and extended that pause again on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight).

At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as NPR has reported , many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again.

Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis

The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual.

Its website says the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday.

All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved live animal cams — will reopen to the public ""on a rolling basis"" by Monday.

""When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs.""","Neighbors in Washington Heights are questioning the approach from masked federal agents after a man was detained and loaded into an unmarked SUV during an apparent immigration enforcement operation.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency says the person arrested was an undocumented immigrant from an African country who had a removal order since February of last year.

Video from Wednesday morning captured by a neighbor shows masked agents wearing Homeland Security Investigation gear pulling at least one man out of his car near the corner of West 157th Street and Broadway.

Witnesses say the person detained appeared to be an Uber driver and screamed as he was being loaded into an unmarked black SUV before leaving the neighborhood.

Peter Green, who recorded the footage, said the man was already being pulled out of the car when he got there, so he couldn't know exactly what happened prior. But he says it was a jarring sight in New York City.

""I mean, this is the kind of thing that I’ve seen in other countries,"" Green said. ""I’ve been a journalist in war zones, and it’s the kind of thing I’ve seen in Yugoslavia during the war. It’s not what I expect to see on the streets of New York.""

Shaun Abreu, a local Democratic council member who joined neighbors who disagree with the method and execution of the arrest, says advocates are still working to gather information about the individual detained.

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for ICE enforcement, confirmed the arrest Wednesday of an Alpha Amadou Diallo of Guinea. He allegedly entered the U.S. illegally near Del Rio, Texas. McLaughlin says Diallo received full due process and was ordered removed from the United States in February 2024.

2027 Diversity Visa Program

The U.S. Department of State announced on Nov. 5, 2025, that it is in the process of implementing certain undisclosed changes to the upcoming Diversity Visa (DV) entry process and will announce the start date for the DV-2027 registration period when it's ready. The changes to be implemented are not expected to affect the visa application period for individuals selected under the DV-2027 program, which is to remain Oct. 1, 2026 to Sept. 30, 2027. For now, stakeholders await additional news and guidance from the State Department.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

TPS is an area that is often changing, but as of Oct. 3, 2025, TPS has been terminated for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti (effective Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) valid through Feb. 3, 2026), Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Syria (effective EADs valid through Nov. 21, 2025).

TPS remains active for Burma (Myanmar) (registration for eligible individuals remains open through Nov. 25, 2025), El Salvador (effective EADs valid through Sept. 9, 2026, and EADs auto-extended through March 9, 2026), Ethiopia (effective EADs valid through Dec. 12, 2025), Lebanon (effective EADs valid through May 27, 2026, and registration available through May 27, 2026), Somalia, South Sudan (effective EADs were valid through Nov. 3, 2025) and Sudan (designated extended through Oct. 19, 2026, and effective EADs through April 19, 2026).

TPS status for Venezuela continues to be the subject of ongoing litigation and was initially terminated, but then was restored on Oct. 3, 2025, by the U.S. Supreme Court through Nov. 7, 2025.

Cessation of Automatic Extension of EADs

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a final rule on Oct. 30, 2025, ending the 540-day automatic extension of EADs for eligible applicants who timely file renewal applications on or after Oct. 30, 2025. This is concerning to many stakeholders because the 540-day automatic extension provided the means pursuant to which businesses were able to continue to employ eligible workers when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) takes six months or longer to process such renewal applications.

Since workers under an EAD must have a valid EAD in hand to be authorized to work, employers will be faced with having to terminate valuable employees because USCIS has long delays in processing the underlying Forms I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization). As of Nov. 3, 2025, more than 900,000 EAD applications were pending with USCIS for more than six months and, as of June 3, 2025, 20 percent of all categories of EAD renewal applications were pending longer than six months.

$100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee Updated Guidance

USCIS has provided additional guidance on implementation of the new $100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee. The new $100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee is required for every H-1B visa petition filed on or after Sept. 21, 2025, if 1) the beneficiary is currently outside the U.S. and does not have a valid H-1B visa; 2) the underlying H-1B visa petition requested consular notification of approval, when and if issued; or 3) USCIS approved the H-1B visa petition but denied the change of status or extension of status, or the beneficiary leaves the U.S. while the H-1B visa petition is pending processing by USCIS.

USCIS has confirmed that the new $100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee is not applicable: 1) if the underlying H-1B visa petition was filed before 12:01 a.m. EDT on Sept. 21, 2025; 2) for petitions that request and for which USCIS grants a change of status, extension of status or amendment; 3) for visa issuance applications pursuant to an H-1B visa petition that was approved in accordance with No. 2 immediately above; or 4) if the admission to the U.S. is pursuant to a new H-1B visa issued based on an approved change of status, extension of status or amendment, or pursuant to a ""current valid H-1B visa.""

One of the primary concerns here, aside from the legality of requiring this new $100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee, is whether USCIS will approve a visa petition but deny the change of status, extension of status or amendment request. Also noted is the ambiguity of the phrase ""current valid H-1B visa"" referenced in No. 4 above and the lack of guidance on the specific meaning and implication.

Payment of the new $100,000 H-1B Proclamation Fee must be paid online prior to submission of an applicable H-1B visa petition online using www.pay.gov, following instructions on the website. Submission of an H-1B visa petition requiring payment of this new fee without proof of payment will be denied, unless the submission qualifies for a national interest exception. To qualify for a national interest exception, a request must be submitted online to the DHS-designated email address with supporting evidence evidencing that 1) the underlying beneficiary's presence in the U.S. as an H-1B worker is in the national interest, 2) there is no ""American"" available to fill the underlying role, 3) requiring the petitioning employer to make the payment on behalf of the proposed foreign national employee would significantly undermine the interests of the U.S., and 4) the proposed foreign national employee does not pose a threat to the security of welfare of the U.S. There has been no guidance advising how to evidence a national interest exception and how to evidence a lack of available ""Americans"" to fill the proposed position.

New Immigration Parole Fee Required by H.R.1 Reconciliation Bill

DHS announced on Oct. 15, 2025, the implementation of a new $1,000 parole fee effective Oct. 16, 2025, for any foreign national who is paroled into the U.S. unless he or she qualifies for one of 10 exceptions. If required, the fee is not paid when the parole application is submitted to USCIS, but DHS will collect the $1,000 fee after it determines in its discretion that the foreign national will be granted parole and the foreign national appears for inspection at a port of entry to enter the U.S. or is already physically present in the U.S. The 10 exceptions include certain instances involving a medical emergency and related treatment, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to visit a close family member whose death is imminent, the foreign national coming to the U.S. to attend a funeral for a close family member, or the foreign national is an applicant for adjustment of status under Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) – i.e., a green card application – and is returning to the U.S. after temporary travel.

Collection of Biometric Data Upon Entering and Exiting the U.S.

Effective Dec. 26, 2025, the Homeland Security Department plans to start collecting biometric data (i.e., photographs and fingerprints) from noncitizens.

USCIS Requires Electronic Payment

As of Oct. 27, 2025, USCIS no longer accepts paper checks as payment for USCIS filing fees. Instead, all USCIS payments must be made electronically using Form G-1650 (Authorization for ACH Transactions) or Form G-1450 (Authorization for Credit Card Transactions), unless an exemption is available. A separate Form G-1650 or Form G-1450 must be filed for each USCIS filing fee required for a submission.

Public Charge Inadmissibility

USCIS published a Policy Memorandum on Sept. 4, 2025, reaffirming its strict adherence to statutory and regulatory language determining whether a Form I-485 green card applicant is inadmissible based on the ground of public charge. This Policy Memorandum does not change the law; rather, it is essentially a reminder that USCIS has the discretion to make a public charge determination based on the totality of the circumstances. When making its subjective determination, the USCIS officer considers factors such as the applicant's age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status and education and skills, as well as an Affidavit of Support when legally required to consider and the foreign national's receipt of government benefits as defined by the regulation of public case assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.

""I am so grateful to everyone who has advocated on my behalf, and on behalf of the countless others who have experienced similar trauma over recent months in the Chicago area,"" Santillana Galeano said in a statement. ""I love our community and the children I teach, and I can't wait to see them again.""

Earlier Wednesday, federal Judge Jeremy C. Daniel ordered the Trump administration to provide a bond hearing for Santillana Galeano.

Judge Daniel ruled, as he has in other recent high-profile cases, that Santillana Galeano's detention without a bond hearing was unlawful because it violated her right to due process.

""We are thrilled that Ms. Santillana was released, and has been able to return home to Chicago where she belongs,"" said attorney Charlie Wysong, who represents Santillana Galeano along with Ms. Naiara Testai at Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd. ""We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States. We are grateful to her community for the outpouring of support over these difficult days, and ask that her privacy be respected while she rests and recovers from this ordeal.""

Erin Horetski, a parent of one of the children Santillana Galeano teaches at the day care told ABC News she ""burst into tears"" when she heard the news of her release. She said ""Ms. Diana's"" statement says a lot about the type of person she is.

""She's thinking first about the kids, about all of us, even after everything she has been through. It's moments like this when you're reminded that people like Diana are the heart of this community. And even in the darkest circumstances, her instinct is to send love outward,"" Horetski told ABC News.

Parents who leave their children at Rayito de Sol Spanish immersion day care and preschool on Chicago's North Side voiced concern last week after Santillana Galeano was detained.

The Colombian day care teacher was being held at the Broadview U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility before being transferred to Clark County.

A federal judge previously barred the Trump administration from removing Santillana Galeano, 38, from the U.S. and transferring her to any federal jurisdiction outside of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, court documents show.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Santillana Galeano was arrested for human trafficking. A statement from the agency alleges she paid traffickers to bring to two teenage children to the U.S.

DHS reports Santillana Galeano and a man driving her car refused to stop last Wednesday and then fled into the day care, barricading themselves inside.

Some who witnessed the incident and viewed video at the day care refute that claim, instead alleging armed ICE agents went room to room inside the day care.

Court records state Santillana Galeano has applied for either asylum or withholding of removal and was granted a work permit that is valid through Nov. 12, 2029.

Judge Daniel also ordered a bond hearing for the father of a teen cancer patient, who was being held in Clark County.

He said the circumstances of the arrests showed him that, by and large, Operation Midway Blitz was not targeting hardened criminals.
The development in court comes amid litigation over whether immigration officials have violated a consent decree restricting warrantless arrests.
In his Oct. 7 order extending the consent decree until February, Cummings said ICE had improperly told its field offices over the summer that the consent decree had been canceled.
He also ordered ICE to broadcast the conditions of the consent decree order to its offices nationwide.","A federal judge on Wednesday said he plans to grant bond to hundreds of immigrants whose arrests during Operation Midway Blitz are being challenged under a consent decree that limits so-called warrantless arrests that occur without a prior warrant or probable cause.

In a packed hearing at Chicago’s federal courthouse, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the immediate release of 13 people whose arrests the Department of Justice agreed violated the 2022 agreement.

The judge also told lawyers for the government to produce a list by Nov. 19 detailing how many of a subset of 615 class members were still in custody, and whether they qualified for mandatory detention due to a prior criminal history or removal order.

Unless a detainee was shown to be a security risk, Cummings said he would allow their release on a $1,500 bond and some form of monitoring, including electronic ankle monitors, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings. Most of those arrested were originally processed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview, but have since been moved to jails around the country.

Meanwhile, Cummings’ decision will ultimately affect a much wider segment of the thousands of arrests made by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol in Chicago since the Trump administration’s enhanced immigration-enforcement operations.

So far, the government has identified more than 3,300 such arrests, the vast majority of which plaintiffs’ attorneys believe will prove to be unlawful.

In explaining his decision, Cummings read from a summary he and his law clerks compiled from more than 150 ongoing immigration petitions in federal court, where arrestees were challenging deportation. He said the circumstances of the arrests showed him that, by and large, Operation Midway Blitz was not targeting hardened criminals.

Of them, Cummings said, 54 people were arrested while at work, including 20 landscapers, four Uber or taxi drivers, and two street vendors. Another 20 were arrested while commuting to or from work, and nine were detained at a Home Depot or Menards, where they were presumably either seeking work or buying job supplies, the judge said.

Six were arrested “outside their home or a friend’s or relative’s home,” he said. Seven people were arrested at immigration hearings or appointments, and another 11 in public places such as shops, grocery stores, and even “a Dunkin’ Donuts drive-thru,” Cummings said.

“It is highly unlikely any of them are criminal gang members, drug traffickers or assorted ne’er-do-wells who fall under the category of what ICE has called ‘the worst of the worst,'” Cummings said.

Upon learning of the judge’s plans, William Weiland, a civil attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, called it “quite significant” and asked for an immediate stay on any order of release so he could speak with his superiors. At least 12 of the 615 were considered to be a significant security risk, and more time was needed to vet them, Weiland said.

Cummings said he would give the government time to compile that information and ordered both sides to submit a status report on Nov. 21.

While the judge’s rulings Wednesday were significant, there was still a lot of work to be done, including figuring out the logistics of how to even notify clients that they are eligible for bond, said plaintiffs’ attorney Mark Fleming.

As the government has dragged its feet, Fleming said, hundreds of people arrested under Midway Blitz have been deported or agreed to leave the country as they sat in jail. It’s difficult to pinpoint how many people fall into those categories, but that number is growing each day, Fleming said.

After the hearing, Fleming, of the National Immigrant Justice Center, said the case would ultimately show that many aspects of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies — including the “terrorizing of neighborhoods” by Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino — were against the law.

“This case is going to show that all of this, all of the tactics from Mr. Bovino, all of the tactics from ICE, have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming told reporters in the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse.

The development in court comes amid litigation over whether immigration officials have violated a consent decree restricting warrantless arrests.

Plaintiffs defending those who have been arrested have accused federal officials of repeatedly breaking the terms of the consent decree and asked that Cummings issue a blanket order releasing most of the detainees on ankle monitoring. The government, meanwhile, said plaintiffs were trying to “paint with a broad brush” and that the validity of detaining someone should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Known as the Castañon Nava settlement agreement, the consent decree issued during the Biden administration bars agents from making warrantless immigration arrests unless they have probable cause to believe someone is in the U.S. unlawfully and that the person is a flight risk.

It was originally supposed to sunset in March. Instead, after the Trump administration began ramping up immigration enforcement efforts in January, lawyers for the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU alleged dozens of violations, mostly involving “collateral arrests,” or the detaining of individuals who are not targets.

In his Oct. 7 order extending the consent decree until February, Cummings said ICE had improperly told its field offices over the summer that the consent decree had been canceled. He also called into question the recent immigration raid on an apartment building in South Shore, where agents in military gear burst through doors and zip-tied residents regardless of citizenship.

And the judge also took particular issue with a practice by ICE agents of carrying blank I-200 warrant forms with them on missions and filling them out at the scene.

In his opinion, Cummings ordered ICE to produce the names, detainee tracking information known as “A-numbers,” and arrest documents for anyone arrested in northern Illinois without warrants since June. He also ordered ICE to broadcast the conditions of the consent decree order to its offices nationwide.

In his ruling, Cummings gave a lengthy interpretation of the importance of probable cause, which he said is “heightened by ICE’s embrace” of the race- and employment-based standards set forth recently by the Supreme Court.

Cummings said foreign nationals are “interwoven” with legal residents throughout Chicago, putting U.S. citizens and noncitizens with legal status in jeopardy of being “subjected to ICE questioning for sometimes lengthy periods of detention” during indiscriminate immigration sweeps.

To make his point, the judge referenced the raid in South Shore on Sept. 30, where roughly 300 immigration officers and other law enforcement personnel, supported by Black Hawk helicopters, ransacked the apartment building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive, detaining dozens of people for questioning.

DHS claimed the raid targeted the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and said 37 people were arrested on immigration violations, but have since provided no further details.

Cummings said in his ruling that many details of the raid remain unknown, including the number of warrantless or collateral arrests that were made and whether any of the true targets of the mission were even found there.

“However, one thing seems clear: ICE rousted American citizens from their apartments during the middle of the night and detained them — in zip ties no less — for far longer than the ‘brief’ period authorized by the operative regulation,” Cummings wrote.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-border-patrol-lv-1108-5_246867780_e343f0.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-13 13:57:40.984248

Ms. McIver’s lawyers had argued that the charges should be dismissed before trial for several reasons, including the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause.","A federal judge in New Jersey ruled on Thursday that the Justice Department could proceed with its case against Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat accused of assaulting immigration agents outside a privately run jail where thousands of migrants awaiting deportation have been held.

Lawyers for Ms. McIver, who has maintained her innocence, said they were reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment. But they had indicated in court papers that they planned to appeal the decision if the judge ruled — as he has — against Ms. McIver’s claim that she was immune from prosecution because she was at the jail to conduct a congressional oversight visit.

In his decision, the judge, Jamel K. Semper of U.S. District Court in New Jersey, also rejected Ms. McIver’s argument that she was being selectively and vindictively prosecuted by President Trump’s Justice Department because she is a Democrat.

Judge Semper concluded that prosecutors were not barred from bringing charges by the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause, which affords members of Congress broad immunity from criminal penalties stemming from the performance of their legislative duties.

He found that the assault charges were only “incidentally related” to Ms. McIver’s congressional oversight visit to the detention center in Newark, which is known as Delaney Hall.

“Defendant’s presence at Delaney Hall does not grant constitutional protection for every act performed in connection to that visit,” Judge Semper wrote in a 41-page decision.

The case, and the constitutional questions at its core, offer a stark illustration of the high stakes that have come into play with the Justice Department’s willingness to pursue criminal charges against outspoken critics of Mr. Trump. The indictment against Ms. McIver, who faces more than a dozen years in prison, was signed by Alina Habba, the president’s former lawyer, whom he appointed New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor.

Neither Ms. Habba nor her spokeswoman responded to requests for comment.

In the months since Ms. McIver’s arrest, the Justice Department has also brought charges against New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, and James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who is one of the president’s most reviled enemies.

The court’s decision could also have wide-reaching implications for congressional oversight visits, which the Trump administration has since tried to limit and has halted altogether during the government shutdown, a development first reported by Politico.

Hanna Rumsey, a spokeswoman for Ms. McIver, said the congresswoman was “disappointed” by the ruling and reiterated that the charges were “baseless.”

“This is not about one person,” Ms. Rumsey said in a statement. “This is about how the administration wants to use criminal charges to target political opponents.”

Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Georgetown who studies legislative procedure and the separation of powers, said the decision by the government to bring charges should be “really worrying to all of us.”

“You have members of the opposition party doing something that is central to their role — things we want them doing — and then we have executive branch officials bringing charges against them,” Professor Chafetz said.

“It’s not to say that opposition members should be above the law,” he added, “but I think we should all be very worried any time you see a member of Congress being charged with anything.”

On May 9, Ms. McIver, 39, was with two House colleagues for an unannounced oversight inspection of the detention center in Newark, which has a 15-year contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency worth $1 billion. Video shows that she was involved in a brief but explosive clash with masked immigration agents, who came out from behind the facility’s gates to arrest the city’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka, on a trespassing charge.

She is accused of using her forearms to “forcibly strike” an agent during the ensuing scrum, in which she can be seen pushing toward Mr. Baraka as she is also pushed from behind. No one was injured in the 68-second confrontation. She and the two other House members, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, went back inside the detention center to participate in a tour, led by ICE agents, after the alleged assault.

Ms. McIver, the judge wrote, “has not met her burden of establishing that her predominant purpose in physically opposing the mayor’s arrest was to conduct oversight or gather information for a legislative purpose. No genuine legislative purpose was advanced by defendant’s alleged conduct.”

The facility is run by one of America’s largest private prison companies, GEO Group. Mr. Baraka, a Democrat who at the time was running for governor, has argued that the jail was operating without a valid certificate of occupancy.

His concern proved valid: In June, four men escaped through a flimsy wall during unrest over crowding and a scarcity of food and water.

Ten days after the altercation outside the detention facility, Ms. Habba’s office moved to dismiss the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka. But in a statement in which she announced that she was dropping the case against the mayor, Ms. Habba said she planned to pursue charges against Ms. McIver.

Body-worn camera videos released by the government in preparation for the trial show a top Homeland Security official explaining to agents that Mr. Baraka was being arrested at the direction of the deputy attorney general, who at the time was Todd Blanche.

Ms. McIver’s lawyers had argued that the charges should be dismissed before trial for several reasons, including the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause. They also cited comments Ms. Habba made as evidence that Ms. McIver, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, was being treated differently than those aligned with the president, including people pardoned after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the capitol.

Days after being named New Jersey’s top prosecutor, Ms. Habba, who played a public role in Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign, said that she hoped to use her office to help elect Republicans and “turn New Jersey red.”

Still, Judge Semper concluded that Ms. McIver had “not demonstrated that her prosecution is a result of personal animus harbored by the prosecution.”

He noted that Ms. McIver’s two House colleagues, who were with her that day, were not charged, undermining her claim that she was being selectively prosecuted.

Ms. Watson Coleman said Thursday that Judge Semper’s decision to permit the case to proceed toward trial did not alter her belief that the assault charges were an egregious attempt to “cool efforts at oversight” of an “out of control” Department of Homeland Security.

“I was there. I saw how D.H.S. agents acted and how LaMonica composed herself,” Ms. Watson Coleman, who is 80 and is not running for re-election next year, said in an email.

“Neither LaMonica, nor I, nor any of our Democratic colleagues will be intimidated.”

What we know:

Diana Santillana Galeano, a teacher at Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center, was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Nov. 5.

The arrest, which happened in front of children, drew sharp condemnation from Mayor Brandon Johnson and members of Congress.

Santillana Galeano was released Wednesday from ICE detention in Clay County, Indiana, and has since returned home to Chicago, according to her attorneys at Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd.

""We are thrilled that Ms. Santillana was released, and has been able to return home to Chicago where she belongs,"" attorney Charlie Wysong said in a statement. ""We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States. We are grateful to her community for the outpouring of support over these difficult days, and ask that her privacy be respected while she rests and recovers from this ordeal.""

Santillana Galeano also thanked supporters, saying she is eager to reunite with her students.

""I am so grateful to everyone who has advocated on my behalf, and on behalf of the countless others who have experienced similar trauma over recent months in the Chicago area,"" she said. ""I love our community and the children I teach, and I can’t wait to see them again.""

A reunion with the daycare community is planned for Friday at 10 a.m. at Clark Park, 3400 N. Rockwell St.

The backstory:

The arrest, captured on video, showed agents detaining Santillana Galeano outside the daycare in the North Center neighborhood.

""ICE agents entered a daycare. They went inside of a preschool. They tore a teacher out of a classroom in front of their children,"" Mayor Johnson said at a news conference a day after the incident. ""That video shocked the conscience of every single Chicagoan… We most certainly cannot have this in our city or our country.""

U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Chicago) echoed the outrage, saying the arrest ""should send shivers down the spine of every parent.""

The other side:

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the daycare was not targeted.

DHS officials claimed the arrest followed a failed traffic stop and that Santillana Galeano and another person fled into the building, ""recklessly endangering the children.""

Santillana Galeano, who is from Colombia, entered the United States illegally in June 2023 and obtained authorization to work under the Biden administration, DHS said. Her 16- and 17-year-old children crossed the border illegally last month near El Paso, Texas, and were brought to a government shelter in Chicago for unaccompanied migrant children.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/daycare-teacher-arrest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-13 15:57:11.494935

To date, the government's repeated refrain in relation to human rights has been that it always acts within the framework of international law.
The government's declarations of respect for international law may be hypocritical, but its actions also demonstrate a distinct political philosophy which is gaining ground in Europe.
In 2016, a year before being elected chancellor, he asserted that certain provisions of the Refugee Convention were outdated.
Nor the 1951 Geneva Convention.","In early July, a week after taking office as minister of migration and asylum in Greece, islamophobic and antisemitic far-right leader Thanos Plevris posted brief remarks on X in response to a comment by a lawyer. The jurist, pointing to an article he had himself written on the subject, had admonished the minister that “if the [1951] Geneva Convention on Refugees is not revised [...], nothing will change!” Mr Plevris assured him that he had read the article and agreed that, “indeed, the Geneva Convention addressed issues from the 1950s and cannot address the issue in 2025 of massive [migration] flows”.

A few days later, during a debate in parliament on an amendment suspending the registration of asylum applications, Plevris demonstrated his idiosyncratic understanding of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the matters it was intended to regulate. “The Geneva [Refugee] Convention was created to protect people who were fleeing the Soviet Union”, he declared, to loud applause from the MPs from the ruling New Democracy party (center-right). His comment was addressed to the Communist MPs, whose invocations of the convention he considered misguided. Mr Plevris did not reveal sources to back up his assertion. However, almost all scholars of the document disagree with him.

What is certain is that Thanos Plevris's declaration is yet another concession by Greece’s government to the far right. What were previously marginal positions are increasingly becoming official policy and the subject of polite debate throughout Europe.

To date, the government's repeated refrain in relation to human rights has been that it always acts within the framework of international law. It has argued this in response to criticism of its capricious laws to get around the Refugee Convention (notably including three-month suspensions of asylum applications in March 2020 and last July) and its systematic violations of the text in practice via its informal refoulements (pushbacks of migrants).

The government's declarations of respect for international law may be hypocritical, but its actions also demonstrate a distinct political philosophy which is gaining ground in Europe. In that vision, the rule of law is being gradually replaced by a regime in which people are arbitrarily deprived of their rights, discriminated against and made to live in intolerable conditions and with no means of protest.

Italy Meloni’s very own interpretation

Those who question international human-rights law may do so openly, but they usually use careful language in their statements for foreign consumption. One example of this is the absurd line that “there was no mass irregular migration and human trafficking” at the time the Refugee Convention was drafted, as Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni asserted at this year's UN General Assembly.

On the sidelines of that event, the Trump administration hosted a conference entitled “The Global Refugee and Asylum System: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It”. Washington proposed nothing less than the abolition of the principle of non-refoulement, a mainstay of the 1951 convention which bans refugees from being returned to countries where their lives or freedom are threatened – the so-called pushbacks. In practice, the Trump administration itself is blatantly violating the principle of non-refoulement and the rule of law, and building its own regime of arbitrariness and terror. Meloni has shown the same contempt for the rule of law, criticizing Italy’s judges for putting the brakes on her xenophobic policies. A case in point was Rome's notorious plan, which morphed into a fiasco, for detention centres in Albania.

International conventions, “when interpreted ideologically by judges with a political agenda, end up trampling on legality instead of upholding it”, Meloni said. She added that “the UN cannot turn a blind eye and protect criminals in the name of rights”.

This was preceded in May by an open letter from the leaders of nine European countries. An initiative of Italy and Denmark (and co-signed by Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Czechia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the United Kingdom), the letter asked the European Court of Human Rights to change its approach to irregular immigration and the deportation of foreigners who commit crimes, and generally to apply the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) more flexibly.

The United Kingdom’s long walk out of the ECHR

In Britain, the campaign to challenge the ECHR began fifteen years ago. In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron remarked that he was sick at the idea that convicted criminals might gain voting rights, referring to an earlier ruling by the Strasbourg court that vindicated a convicted murderer who had appealed against British legislation on the deprivation of voting rights. That same year, Home Secretary Theresa May criticized a court ruling that overturned the deportation of a Bolivian immigrant, falsely claiming that the decision was based on the immigrant's right not to be separated from his cat.

At the Conservative Party conference in early October, party leader Kemi Badenoch, under pressure from a right-wing insurgency by Reform UK under Brexit champion Nigel Farage, pledged to include Britain’s withdrawal from the ECHR in the Conservative election manifesto.

Critics of the ECHR are unhappy because the courts have allowed irregular migrants to remain in the country on the basis of Article 8 (on the protection of family life) and prevented deportations when they consider that there is a risk of inhuman and degrading treatment and torture (prohibited by Article 3).

On the side of the Labour government, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had a long career as a human-rights lawyer, has embarked on a delicate tightrope walk. He remains strongly supportive of the UK's continued membership of the European Convention, all while announcing laws that will impose the government's own interpretation of the document’s controversial clauses.

He has overtly criticized a court ruling that allowed, on the basis of Article 8, a Palestinian family of six from Gaza to join a brother living in Britain. The prime minister hinted at further such moves, noting that deportation decisions have been overturned on the basis of provisions not just in the Refugee Convention, but also the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Marine Le Pen hands the anti-ECHR baton over to the right

In France, Marine Le Pen once declared, in her 2019 New Year's message, that she favoured a French withdrawal from “the straitjacket of the European Convention”. She walked back this position ten months before the May 2022 presidential election. The attack on the ECHR was subsequently led by Eric Zemmour, the other far-right candidate in that election, and the conservative Les Républicains, who proposed amending the French constitution to allow derogations from international conventions in the case of immigrants.

Austria’s long-lasting criticism

In Austria, the far-right FPÖ and the conservative ÖVP have been challenging international conventions for more than a decade. Sebastian Kurz began criticizing international law on becoming foreign minister in 2013. In 2016, a year before being elected chancellor, he asserted that certain provisions of the Refugee Convention were outdated.

Last July, the ÖVP government's minister for European and constitutional affairs, Caroline Edtstadler, came out in favour of revising the convention on the grounds that “it comes from a pre-globalised era, in which the cross-border movements of migrants that we see today were not foreseen”.

Vox’ mass deportation from Spain plan

When it comes to xenophobia, the far right has proven that it has a fertile imagination. Spain's nationalist Vox party is now proposing to deport legal migrants and even Spanish citizens who “have not integrated into society and culture”, and to make “acceptance of Spanish culture and way of life” a prerequisite for remaining in the country. Rothio de Mer, a Vox councillor in Almería, has committed the party to the unworkably complex policy of repatriating 8 million refugees and immigrants who have recently arrived in Spain and are struggling to adapt to Spanish customs and traditions.

Iliana Savova, director of legal protection for refugees and migrants at the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, sees talk of stricter immigration policies as propaganda by far-right and conservative parties that aim to stoke fear in order to manipulate and mobilise voters. She adds that to demand revisions to human-rights conventions is a dangerously slippery slope. “If such a debate is taking place in Europe today, it means that Europe is returning to fascism, which I hope will not happen.”

Greece’s own revisionists

The few articles published in the Greek press in support of revising the Refugee Convention make it clear what political agenda they serve. In a piece entitled “The Geneva Convention on Refugees – a back door to illegal immigration”, posted on 16 June 2020 on the website of the Union of Greek Lawyers, Ioannis Gkitsakis, a jurist at Greece's supreme court, describes the 1951 convention as outdated.

He cites a number of reasons, including that it does not allow for the suspension of its application; that it does not prevent the submission of asylum applications by those who are not entitled to international protection; that it provides for individual examination of each application and forbids grouped rejections of applications “submitted by several persons from the same country of origin, which is considered a safe country”; and that it outlaws “collective measures, such as mass expulsions or refoulements [...] against persons who share common characteristics, such as a common country of origin or a common mode of illegal entry”.

A post by Ioannis Gitsakis on X dispels any doubts about his motives: “Anyone who enters the country illegally has no right to apply for asylum. They must be held in a closed detention centre (or on a deserted island, a decommissioned ship, or a rented facility in Africa), without receiving benefits, until they are deported or leave voluntarily!” In other posts, he refers to “illegal Muslim immigrants”, the woke and LGBTQI agenda; the need to reinstate the death penalty; Israel’s leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who “took it upon himself to clean up the entire planet”; and EAM, Greece's wartime anti-Nazi resistance movement, which “was simply a murderous failed communist organisation”.

In an article published on Capital.gr on 24 September 2024 entitled “Will we let 'Geneva' destroy Europe?”, the author Thanos Tzimeros seconds Ioannis Gitsakis’s article. After referring, among other things, to “cannibalistic tribes” in Africa and “invaders” with a “primitive tradition of violence [...] written in their genes”, Tzimeros concludes that states have the right to close borders via refoulements, as well as to make “arrests, imprisonments, and deportations”, and to use live gunfire. “[The state] decides for itself. Not well-fed UN bureaucrats. Nor the 1951 Geneva Convention. The Convention must be revised yesterday.”

The head of Greece’s Asylum Service, Marios Kaleas, came out in favour of revising the 1951 convention in an article in Vima on 22 October entitled “Reassessing the Geneva Convention in a new era of migration”. Without resorting to extreme language, Mr Kaleas criticizes the document for, among other things, not providing for mechanisms to return those who are not entitled to international protection, and for its “rigid legal scope [which] has created room for divergent national interpretations and procedural inconsistencies”.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge.","By Uriel J. García, Colleen DeGuzman, Alex Nguyen, Carla Astudillo and Nicholas Gutteridge / The Texas Tribune

On the evening of July 1, Luis Medrano called Houston police for help after his wife had gotten violent and punched him twice in the face during a schizophrenic episode in which she was hearing tormenting voices, according to a police report.

Medrano, 50, a Mexican immigrant who met his wife when they crossed the Rio Grande with a group of about a dozen other migrants more than three decades ago, had tried to take his 47-year-old wife to the hospital, but she refused to go. So he did what he’d done three times before: called the police so they would take her to a hospital.

But this time, the officer arrested her on suspicion of assault and booked her into jail. And after a prosecutor dismissed the case, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, picked her up from jail and eventually deported her to Mexico.

“My children blame me for all of this,” Medrano said. “But believe me, this was not my intention; I only wanted to get her help.”

In Texas, which has the second-largest population of undocumented immigrants in the country — with more than 1.6 million of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — the local criminal justice system has become the main funnel sending undocumented immigrants into ICE custody, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of federal government data.

Medrano’s story is emblematic of how the Trump administration has intensified its immigration enforcement compared to Trump’s first term, which focused largely on the southern border amid a record number of asylum seekers. The administration’s focus has now shifted to Democrat-led states such as California, Illinois and New York, where witnesses have recorded masked ICE agents using force in some cases to arrest people at worksites, immigration courts, commercial parking lots and at their homes.

From Trump’s inauguration to July 29, ICE made 138,068 arrests nationwide, 24% of them in Texas.

The Tribune analyzed ICE’s enforcement data from September 2023 to late July 2025, comparing the last 18 months of the Biden administration with the first six months of the Trump administration’s second term. The data, obtained through a public records request to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by the Deportation Data Project, a group of immigration lawyers and professors, shows that in Texas:

• ICE’s average daily arrests have more than doubled from 85 under Biden to 176 under Trump.

• Daily arrests have jumped about 30 percentage points in the ICE regions that include Houston and Dallas.

• About 52% of ICE arrests have been of people in local jails, down from 61% during the Biden administration.

• Arrests of people who had not been convicted of a crime have increased from 42% under Biden to 59% under Trump.

• The Harris County Jail leads the country in ICE detainers — a request from immigration agents to hold a person for deportation — while jails in Dallas, Bexar and Travis counties have also been in the top 10.

The data is the most detailed information to be made publicly available since Trump’s return to the White House and offers a glimpse into its aggressive immigration enforcement in the nation’s interior.

Legal observers have noted the administration has stopped consistently publishing detailed immigration data that his predecessors routinely shared with the public — in some cases, previously published data has been deleted from government websites. For example, a Department of Justice report that showed immigrants in Texas commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens disappeared from the DOJ website soon after Trump took office.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to questions from the Tribune by citing an Oct. 30 social media post by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin that said “70% of illegal aliens ICE has arrested have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.

“And that doesn’t even account for those wanted for violent crimes in their country of origin or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists,” the post says. “The list goes on. The media continues to act as a PR firm for criminals.”

Paul Pirela, a Houston-based immigration lawyer, said the data reveal that the Trump administration’s strategy is simple: “Deport as many people as possible and as fast as possible.”

Cesar Espinosa, executive director of the immigration activist group FIEL in Houston, said his organization can gauge how quickly the Trump administration is working compared to the Biden administration by the number of phone calls they get.

During the Biden administration, he said, “We might get one or two calls with somebody getting picked up by ICE every month, every other month. Now we’re averaging about 15 to 20 calls a day.”

That’s because Texas has been among the most receptive states to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, said Rocio Paez Ritter, a sociology and criminology associate professor at the University of Arkansas.

“What is happening in Texas is that there seems to be a system in place that makes it easier to help ICE deport people, compared to other states like California, where there is more resistance,” she said.

Less than half of arrested immigrants had criminal convictions

In its first term, the Trump administration focused on the southern border as hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many from Central and South America, came seeking asylum. The administration implemented policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “remain in Mexico” policy, under which more than 70,000 non-Mexican people were forced to wait in Mexico until their asylum cases wound through U.S. immigration courts.

But the second Trump administration has been even more aggressive in clamping down on undocumented immigrants in the nation’s interior, setting a goal for ICE of at least 3,000 arrests a day. The data show that in the first six months of this term, ICE averaged 727 arrests a day, more than doubling the 304 daily arrests under Biden.

To help meet that goal, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration enforcement in July aimed at expanding immigrant detention centers and hiring as many as 10,000 additional ICE agents by the end of the year — which would more than double its current staffing of 6,500 agents — and enticing recruits with a $50,000 signing bonus.

“So as those new officers come on, that is inevitably going to lead to a major increase in arrests, and as detention centers come online, more people will be detained, and so immigration enforcement is going to get more aggressive over the next two years,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, a group in Washington, D.C., that advocates for immigrants. “I don’t see this as just an initial surge followed by a slowdown. I think the goal of this administration is pedal to the metal at all points.”

During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump promised “the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,” and administration officials have repeatedly said they are going after “the worst of the worst.”

But during its first six months, the data show that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who don’t have a criminal record than the Biden administration did in its final 18 months. In Texas, 58% of people ICE arrested under Biden had criminal convictions, compared to 42% under Trump, according to the data, which doesn’t specify the type or seriousness of those crimes.

The rhetoric that the Trump administration is going after hardened criminals gives the impression that the administration is focused on the general public safety, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology at the University of California, Irvine.

“Are like 95% of these people arrested the worst of the worst? I don’t think so,” she said. “So the net keeps widening for who is being caught up in these practices and policies.”

César Cuauhtémoc García-Hernández, an immigration law professor at Ohio State University, said the deportation quotas the administration set for itself are pushing them to look beyond people convicted of crimes.

“There simply are not enough migrants in the United States who have committed serious crimes to reach the kinds of detention and deportation numbers that the president and high-ranking and immigration officials in his administration have committed to,” he said.

Two Texas arrests: One on the street, one at an ICE check-in

The data shows that even though the Trump administration has mostly depended on local jails to find and arrest undocumented immigrants, ICE agents have also conducted more non-custodial arrests on the streets, in homes and during ICE check-ins. Some immigrants who have been allowed into the country are required to report to ICE offices periodically while their immigration cases — such as asylum requests — are pending.

Under the Biden administration, 80% of ICE arrests came from county jails and federal and state prisons. Under Trump, that number has dropped to 64.1% — which underscores the increasing ICE activity outside of the criminal justice system.

One of the people arrested recently was Marwan Marouf, who was on his way to work after dropping off his 15-year-old son at a Dallas high school in September. According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.

Marouf, a Palestinian born in Kuwait with Jordanian citizenship, came to the U.S. on a student visa to study electrical engineering at Louisiana State University, then landed a job as an electrical engineer in Dallas. That’s where he met his wife, a fellow Jordanian who was visiting her sister. A year later, they married and had their first child, Mohammed Marouf, now 27.

The elder Marouf became active in the local Muslim community, volunteering to mentor young people and deliver sermons at a local mosque. He also volunteered with other religious groups, including local Christian and Jewish leaders, his son said.

As part of his volunteer work, he donated to a Palestinian-led charity called the Holy Land Foundation, which the Bush administration shut down in 2001 and later prosecuted its leaders, accusing them of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, which the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization.

Marwan Marouf, like many others, said he donated to the charity believing the group’s efforts were solely to support Palestinian people affected by the Israel-Palestine war.

So when he applied for his green card in 2014, immigration officials notified him that they planned on denying his application. Five years later, their U.S.-born son sponsored his parents for a green card — his mother’s application was approved in 2020.

But on Sept. 22, when ICE agents arrested Marwan Marouf, they gave him a letter notifying him that his green card application was denied. Since then, he’s been in custody at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, about a three-hour drive from Dallas. His lawyers are attempting to fight his deportation.

“We’re very spiritual, so we know God has a greater plan for us,” Mohammed Marouf said.

Marwan Marouf has never been charged in connection with his donation to the now-defunct charity. But a statement attributed to McLaughlin, from Homeland Security, said: “A green card is a privilege, not a right. If you are pushing Hamas propaganda, supporting terrorist organizations, and conducting other anti-American actions, you will face consequences.”

A month before Marouf’s arrest, ICE agents detained Austin resident Yony Perez-Oduardo, 42, but they didn’t have to go looking for him.

Perez-Oduardo had entered the country in Brownsville in May 2022 and when Border Patrol arrested him, he was placed in the Migrant Protection Protocols and was allowed to remain in the country while his asylum request was pending, as long as he checked in with ICE in San Antonio.

Meanwhile, his 40-year-old wife, Ana and their 14-year-old daughter — who came to Texas through a Biden administration program that allowed Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to enter the U.S. under a parole program that Trump has since shut down — eventually received green cards, making them legal permanent residents.

Meanwhile, Perez-Oduardo continued to do his semiannual check-ins with ICE, waiting for a decision on his asylum case. On Aug. 12, Perez was arrested at an ICE office in San Antonio as his wife and daughter watched.

“They took him away and our girl had to witness it,” said his wife. “It traumatized her.”

ICE deported Perez-Oduardo to Mexico in the past month, his lawyer said, because it’s a faster process than trying to deport him to Cuba. If he fought his deportation, he could have been kept in detention for months and banned from the country for a decade, said his lawyer, John Dutton. Perez-Oduardo may have a chance to eventually return to the U.S. because his wife has sponsored him for a green card, Dutton added.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago

After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge. When he tried to post bail for her release, Harris County Jail officials told him ICE had placed a detainer on Gonzalez so agents could deport her after her case was settled.

When prosecutors dismissed the case, she was immediately transferred to an immigrant detention center, then deported to Mexico on Oct. 1. Medrano, who was also undocumented, followed her, leaving their four U.S.-citizen adult children behind. They have since relocated to San Luis Potosí, where they have some distant relatives.

In 2017, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office agreed with ICE to let its agents have access to the jail to investigate inmates’ immigration status.

“This agreement has allowed our agency to redeploy deputies who previously were performing ICE duties in the jail to local law enforcement duties that enhance public safety,” said Jason Spencer, a Harris County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson.

Unlike California, which has the most undocumented immigrants in the nation, Texas has followed the Trump administration’s lead in cracking down on undocumented people under Gov. Greg Abbott.

Since 2021, the state Legislature has approved more than $11 billion for border enforcement and building border walls — all part of Abbott’s signature Operation Lone Star, which since 2021 has sent thousands of state troopers and National Guard soldiers to the Texas-Mexico border.

In 2017, the Legislature approved a bill that outlawed any local policies that prevent cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement, a law that has forced immigrant-friendly cities and counties to work with ICE, even if local leaders oppose it.

In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport undocumented people who crossed the Texas-Mexico border. The Biden administration, El Paso County and immigrant rights organizations sued the state to overturn the law, which is on hold while the case remains pending in the courts.

And in this year’s legislative session, lawmakers approved a law requiring Texas sheriffs to enter into formal agreements with ICE that allow them to deputize some deputies to work as immigration agents. Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest undocumented immigrants: Between late January and early September, troopers arrested 3,131 people across the state, most of them on suspicion of improper entry into the country.

In Harris County, which leads the country in ICE detainers, Abbott recently launched a violent crimes task force that includes state troopers and local police, and said residents should expect a higher law enforcement presence “swarming” the area.

“The Trump administration is relying quite heavily on partnerships with local law enforcement agencies in Republican-led states, because those are the places that are willing to work hand in hand with ICE,” said García-Hernández, the Ohio State professor.

Those partnerships can help turn a misdemeanor arrest into a deportation.

Once a person is in jail for any offense, ICE agents can check their immigration status, and if they’re undocumented, ask sheriffs — who commonly run the jails — to hold the person for them so they can be transferred to ICE custody and deported.

“Sometimes it’s been as simple as a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt or a DUI or other charges,” said Pirela, the Houston immigration lawyer.

Medrano said he and his wife, who have lived most of their adult lives in the U.S., will struggle to establish new lives in Mexico.

“Before all this, we had a comfortable life,” said Medrano, who worked as a construction contractor most of the time that they lived in Houston.

When the government is fully reopened, the Department of Labor (DOL) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may issue further guidance on potential remedies for employment-based immigration filings that were unable to be submitted during the lapse in DOL operations. While the DOL has already provided some general guidance, there are some gaps in the announced policies, specifically with respect to PERM labor certification recruitment that expired in the early part of the shutdown.

The passage of a temporary spending measure means that there will be no interruption of federal operations through January 30, but a shutdown after that date remains a possibility if there is no agreement on FY 2026 appropriations legislation or an additional stopgap by January 30. Employers should work with counsel to carefully plan the timing of any upcoming immigration filings and related activities, especially for applications submitted to the DOL or that require a DOL-certification (such as a certified PERM or Labor Condition Application (LCA)) in order to move forward with USCIS and/or State Department filings. The suspension of DOL operations is generally the most disruptive to sponsoring employers during a shutdown; advance planning may be able to minimize some of the disruption in the event of a possible February 2026 shutdown.

During the 10-day operation, ICE and 287(g) partner FDLE arrested 230 criminal illegal aliens who are registered sex offenders and have egregious criminal histories. These crimes include sexual assault, sexual battery, lewd and lascivious molestation of children, possession of narcotics, possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance, burglary, attempted premeditated murder with a deadly weapon and aggravated battery.

“This operation underscores President Trump and Secretary Noem’s determination to target and remove dangerous criminal alien predators from the United States,” said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan. “Sanctuary cities that shield these criminals from accountability undermine the rule of law and jeopardize the safety of their residents. By contrast, Florida has shown exceptional leadership and dedication to public safety through strong partnerships with ICE. Together, we send an unmistakable message: Criminal aliens who threaten our citizens and violate our laws will be removed and prevented from committing further heinous crimes.”

""Through Operation Criminal Return, hundreds of the most dangerous illegal criminal aliens with horrific criminal histories, including sexual crimes against children, are off our streets and will be out of our country soon,"" said Governor Ron DeSantis. ""Florida has been the most aggressive state in America on combating illegal immigration, and our state and local law enforcement agencies are doing more every day to be the federal government's greatest tool in the fight to enforce immigration law.""

“Florida will not harbor criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Through this joint operation with ICE, we located and arrested convicted illegal alien sexual offenders and predators, ensuring they can no longer harm our communities,” said FDLE Commissioner Mark Glass. “In Florida, strong partnerships are vital to public safety, and our collaboration with ICE provides a model for the rest of the country as we continue to carry out the mission of President Trump and Governor DeSantis in removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our communities.”

Some of the criminal illegal alien offenders apprehended include the following:

These arrests highlight the critical 287(g) partnership between ICE and FDLE in protecting vulnerable populations and removing dangerous individuals from the country. Under ICE’s 287g Task Force Model, local law enforcement officers who encounter suspected illegal aliens receive delegated authority to question and arrest those violating immigration law. The 287g Task Force Model is a powerful force multiplier, extending the reach of ICE and providing local agencies with a tool to protect their communities.

To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.
Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities.","Immigrants who have recently been held at the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center say that conditions at the facility, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in rural Evangeline Parish, have deteriorated as more and more people have been held there over the past year.

In interviews, a man detained at Pine Prairie through June and a legal consultant for another man held there this summer described a crowded facility with scarce resources — men sleeping on floors due to an alleged lack of beds inside packed dormitories; detainees wearing the same uniforms for several days because they weren’t given a change of clothing (not even underwear), pleading with staff for hygiene products to keep themselves clean and denied access to medical care and other services.

“These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life,” said Alexandra Smolyar, an attorney at Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice who consulted with the man detained at Pine Prairie over the Summer.

Pine Prairie, which is run by the private prison corporation the GEO Group, has a contract with ICE that calls for a maximum daily population of 500. But it has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees since as early as mid-April, according to information from data research organization Transactional Records Access Clearing House at Syracuse University, or TRAC. While ICE reported that Pine Prairie had an average daily population of 788 on Sept. 15, the most recent date for which a count is available, TRAC researchers have calculated the average population at that time at 915 people.

Since President Trump was sworn in for his second term — promising an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants, no matter whether they have criminal records or are considered dangerous — the number of people being held in immigration detention has skyrocketed by 69%, from just over 39,000 in December to about 66,000 today.

Complaints from immigrant rights advocates about poor conditions inside detention centers are not uncommon. In 2020 and 2021, federal oversight bodies received several complaints from advocates about lack of hygiene products and personal protective equipment inside Louisiana’s immigration detention facilities, including Pine Prairie, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As that detained population has grown in 2025, media reports and advocates have described cramped quarters where living conditions have gone from bad under the Biden Administration, to much worse under Trump.

Advocates told Verite News that Pine Prairie is a case in point. They said capacity issues are leading to worsening conditions at the facility, which already had a long history of complaints alleging human rights abuses and civil rights violations.

“This year it feels much worse,” said Tania Wolf, an advocacy manager at the National Immigration Project, who has gone on frequent visits to ICE detention centers in Louisiana. “It feels like things are getting to a point where things are gonna boil over in terms of conditions.”

A ‘horrible pressure point’

Lenin, a Honduran citizen who was detained at Pine Prairie from October 2024 until he was deported in June, said in an interview last week that conditions at the facility were poor during the entirety of his stay. Lenin, who said he fled his birth country in 2015 after MS-13 gang members allegedly killed a close relative and threatened to kill him, asked Verite News to publish only his middle name because he fears for his safety since he has returned to Honduras.

Lenin said when he first arrived at Pine Prairie he was placed in a crowded dorm where some men slept on the floor. He said that he and other detainees had been given only one pair of underwear and one uniform, leaving them with no way of changing into clean clothes for days. They had difficulty getting hygiene items, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste and at times even toilet paper, Lenin said. The dorm was kept cold and staff would not respond to detainees’ requests to increase the temperature, he alleged, adding that staff often denied him visits to the medical unit to receive medication or treatment for anxiety and depression.

“They don’t treat us like humans,” Lenin said. “If you don’t speak English, you can’t have anything,”

In late July and in early August, attorney Alexandra Smolyar, at the Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sent emails to immigrant rights lawyers who work in Louisiana, including Wolf, alleging “absolutely abysmal” conditions inside Pine Prairie, relayed to her by a detainee with whom she had consulted.

ICE keeps detaining pregnant immigrants — against federal policy

The details laid out in her emails are similar to the conditions that Lenin described — inadequate clothing leading to detainees wearing the same clothes for days on end, guards shouting and using profanity when speaking to detainees, staff skipping nightly pill calls causing people to miss medications, detainees getting the wrong medication.

“Overcrowding is growing more dire by the day; medical care is severely lacking; there’s no access to a law library or mail,” she wrote in an August email. “The conditions are really harrowing.”

In a September interview, Smolyar said the Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, who has since been deported, described to her a packed intake area for people initially booked into the facility with one shower, one toilet and one sink and detainees sleeping on bare mattresses set on the floor of a holding cell. (Smolyar declined to identify the former Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, but she said he was deported in August.)

“It epitomized how the expansion of detention is coming to this horrible, horrible pressure point where people’s lives are in jeopardy every day,” Smolyar said.

Wolf said she had already become concerned about overcrowding at Pine Prairie in July, when she attended a standard tour of the detention center.

Wolf said she and others on the tour — which was approved by ICE officials — repeatedly asked staff and accompanying ICE agents for a count of detainees booked into the facility that day. In her notes, Wolf wrote that the group was never given a population count. The omission, she said, was very unusual.

When the tour got to the visitation area — a space where detainees often meet with attorneys — Wolf said it looked more run down than in previous visits she’d made to Pine Prairie.

“It just looked a little bit more — for lack of a better term — lived in,” Wolf said.

Wolf said detainees later told her that some of them had been sleeping in the visitation unit due to overcrowding. In a phone interview this week, Wolf said she’d never heard of a facility making detainees sleep in its visitation area before then.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the GEO Group, the company that operates Pine Prairie, denied claims of worsening living conditions at the facility.

“GEO strongly rejects these baseless claims, which are preposterous and bizarre,” wrote GEO Group Director of Corporate Relations Christopher Ferreira. “The Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center provides high quality support services that adhere to ICE’s detention standards and contract requirements, which provide for ample access to pre-scheduled recreation opportunities both indoors and outdoors. Individuals at the Center are in no way deprived of natural light nor are they subjected to excessive artificial light.”

In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Tamara Spicer, did not answer specific questions about conditions at Pine Prairie but said the agency is experiencing “unprecedented operational demands” due to “recent unlawful border crossings.”

“ICE has appropriately intensified enforcement operations to restore integrity to the system,” Spicer said. “The volume of apprehensions is not the result of ICE policy but the direct result of individuals choosing to break the law. ICE will not apologize for enforcing U.S. law.”

Problems with ICE’s population figures

ICE provides bimonthly reports with “snapshots” of the total number of detainees in its custody in each state and overall. But, for individual facilities, the agency only reports the average daily population — pooling numbers from the start of the fiscal year (October 1) through the present day. The result is a skewed perception of how many people are detained at a facility at any given time.

In April, ICE reported that Pine Prairie detained an average of 689 people — though ICE records show the population reached as high as 923 on April 13, a number obtained by TRAC through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Data researchers have responded to the lack of consistent data on daily population counts by creating a new method to calculate the average daily populations that they say provides more accurate results for how many people are currently (or have recently been) detained at a facility. To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.

Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities. According to the site, on Sept. 2, Pine Prairie’s interval daily population was 1,010 detainees, more than double its contractual capacity and 233 people and more than ICE’s reported average population for the same day of 783 people.

State’s challenge to New Orleans jail ‘sanctuary’ policy can move forward, judge rules

Overcrowding in ICE facilities began making headlines in March, when images and video from inside Krome detention center in Miami showed detainees sleeping on floors with cardboard boxes for makeshift mattresses.

According to data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by researchers at TRAC, nearly half of all ICE facilities in the country were housing more detainees than their contracts with ICE allowed as early as April.

That data showed two other Louisiana facilities, Richwood Correctional Center and Winn Correctional Center, run by private prison company LaSalle Corrections, were operating over their contractual capacities by several dozen detainees.

LaSalle Corrections did not respond to emailed requests for comment on its facilities’ operating over capacity.

Backed up

Wolf said that on the tour at Pine Prairie, staff referred to the detention center as an “overflow” facility for ICE’s staging facility in Alexandria that sits on the tarmac of an international airport that is the Department of Homeland Security’s main deportation hub. Considered the final stop for many migrants before they are removed from the U.S., the staging facility is supposed to hold detainees for 72-hours or less, while ICE prepares for their deportation flights. However, in September, the Guardian reported that many detainees are being held at Alexandria for longer than three days.

“For the system to work … the people who are going to be funneled into the staging facility need to be somewhere else in the weeks preceding,” said Norah Ahmed, legal director at ACLU of Louisiana.

According to Ahmed, Pine Prairie appears to be operating as a pre-staging facility — holding detainees with orders of deportation who may have exhausted their options for legal ways to remain in the country while their deportation flights are being prepared. She said when flights don’t take off as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances, such as negotiation breakdowns between the U.S. and countries accepting deportees, sometimes people get returned to Pine Prairie after it has already accepted new residents to take their place, contributing to overcrowding.

Lenin spent roughly nine months at Pine Prairie. As the facility was growing more crowded, Lenin said, he was in solitary confinement. He said staff told him it was for his own safety after a confrontation with other detainees. He said he told staff members that isolation, inside a small room with no windows to the outside world and where the hallway lights were kept on continuously, might exacerbate his anxiety and depression. But he remained in segregation, he said until his deportation in June.

Smolyar, who works mainly with people detained in Georgia, said she fears that, in the months since the detainee she was consulting with at Pine Prairie was deported, things have gotten worse.

“We’re seeing incredibly high numbers of people being detained. They’re being pushed to a breaking point,” Smolyar said. “These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:58:12.399943

Immigration agents detained around 30 field workers in Collier County on Wednesday morning, causing distress among local families.

""I know here in Collier it's been a nightmare trying to find family members, where they've gone. It's been a nightmare,"" said Luna R. from Immokalee, Florida.

Luna and Sol watched as ICE agents detained more than 30 people along Camp Keais Road, a quiet stretch between Immokalee and Ave Maria, around 8 a.m.

""We see all the stuff you're doing? Do you have a female officer? Do you have a female officer?"" asked a witness in a video of the incident.

Witnesses say immigration agents and state troopers stopped a bus carrying workers heading to the fields. The bus had the name Pacific Tomato Growers, one of the area's agricultural employers.

""Those buses usually hold around 40 people, like, to the max whenever it's full. And we saw, by the end of it, there was only three workers left. That were released, and three vans were filled up with all the workers left. So that was, seeing like the before and after was very heartbreaking,"" said Sol R. from Immokalee, Florida.

DOJ should return to its 2014 requirements for temporary immigration judges and require immigration or adjudicatory experience – or both – for temporary immigration judges.","The Department of Justice recently appointed 25 temporary immigration judges, two-thirds of whom are military lawyers, or JAGs, to adjudicate civil immigration cases. The Pentagon says it plans to send hundreds more JAGs to help relieve the strain on immigration courts. These unprecedented moves violate federal law and breach a foundational American principle: military power must not be wielded over civilians in domestic affairs.

Immigration judges are typically career civil employees who are appointed by the Attorney General to serve as administrative judges. Assigning JAGs these positions violates the Posse Comitatus Act, a key law that prohibits the military from “executing” civilian laws. Besides being against the law, the appointments are a bad idea. They breach the foundational norm separating military authority from civilian governance. It would be as if active-duty military officers were assigned to serve as tax court judges or administrative law judges, proposals that would immediately raise constitutional concerns.

The plan to reassign hundreds of JAGs also removes them from the military where they are needed to provide critical legal advice, including on the deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities and the use of lethal force, including in the Caribbean. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to sideline military lawyers (including firing the top uniformed JAGs in February), the counsel provided by JAGs on complex legal matters is more important than ever. Congress, which has the constitutional authority to make rules for the “Government and Regulation of land and naval forces” should closely scrutinize any effort to hollow out the JAG Corps.

Two Plans to Turn Military Lawyers Into Immigration Judges

The administration has floated two options for reassigning JAGs. One plan was announced by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and involved the use of JAGs serving as a federal military force. Separately, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a plan involving a small number of Florida National Guard JAGs. By regulation, temporary immigration judges are subject to the management and oversight of the chief immigration judge at the DOJ. Still, it is unclear if these newly assigned JAGs will act in an entirely civilian capacity or if they will continue to function under their usual military chain of command. Although many details remain unclear, we have an understanding of the broad outlines of the potential plans, along with the significant concerns they raise about the legality of the JAGs’ assignments and anticipated work.

Plan #1: Assigning Active-Duty and Reserve JAGs as Immigration Judges

The first option, which has already begun, is to reassign active-duty and reserve JAGs to work as immigration judges. News of the plan broke in early September, just days after the DOJ dropped the requirement that temporary immigration judges be either administrative law judges or retired DOJ immigration adjudicators. Now, the DOJ allows “any lawyer” to serve as an immigration judge. This regulatory change skirted traditional notice-and-comment processes that would call for transparency and an opportunity for contemporaneous public comment. Instead, the new rule relied upon comments solicited 11 years ago during the Obama administration. At that time, the DOJ implemented a rule change permitting former immigration law judges and administrative law judges to serve as temporary immigration judges for renewable six-month terms. The Trump DOJ initiative goes much further, short-circuiting the administrative rulemaking process and paving the way for JAGs to be detailed as immigration judges.

This change in defining who is eligible to serve as an immigration judge is not a routine personnel revision, and, therefore, it should be closely scrutinized and subject to traditional notice and comment procedures. After all, allowing any lawyer–including JAGs–to serve as a temporary immigration judge, regardless of their qualifications, affects the due process rights of immigrants appearing before the court, who are no longer assured that the judges hearing their cases are versed in the complex legal specialty of immigration law. Further, although JAGs can serve as military judges presiding over courts-martial, they generally lack immigration law expertise and rarely have adjudicated civilian matters.

Plan #2: Assigning National Guard Members as Immigration Judges

The second reported plan involves calling up National Guard JAGs to work as immigration judges. In July, for example, President Donald Trump and DeSantis (himself a former Navy JAG) reportedly agreed to assign Florida National Guard lawyers to do just that. According to Florida’s Immigration Enforcement plan, these assignments would make only a small contribution to the effort to detail hundreds of JAGs as immigration judges: just nine field-grade National Guard members are suitable for service as immigration judges. In addition, to serve as immigration judges, Guard members would have to be activated and federalized under the command and control of the president, but the only way to do so is under 10 U.S.C. §12301(d), which requires the consent of the Guard member to be activated.

Under either plan, there are significant questions about the legality of the appointments, including whether they violate long-standing laws prohibiting JAGs from serving as civil law enforcement.

Violating the Posse Comitatus Act’s Plain Meaning

The appointment of JAGs to serve as immigration judges violates the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). A “posse comitatus” is a Latin term used in British and American law to mean a group of people a sheriff mobilizes to suppress lawlessness. The PCA is a criminal law that dates to 1878, and bars any part of the federal military forces from being used as a posse comitatus, i.e., participating in civilian law enforcement. The statute, in full, states:

Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

Under the PCA, implied authority is not enough; the authority to execute the laws must be “expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” The JAG assignments fall within the PCA ban because immigration judges execute domestic law, and there is no express authorization for military lawyers to serve as immigration judges.

Despite its importance, the term “execute the laws” itself is not defined in statute and remains ambiguous. No case law squarely addresses whether immigration judges adjudicating immigration cases are “executing the law.” Nevertheless, even under a narrow reading of that term, JAGs serving as immigration judges would clearly “execute the law.”

Several decades ago, in United States v. Yunis, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia endorsed a leading jurisprudential test for analyzing PCA violations: the PCA prohibits activities that “subject civilians to the exercise of military power that is regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature.” The lower court in Yunis provided a more detailed analysis of those terms that the appeals court effectively ratified, defining a regulatory power as one which “controls or directs,” a proscriptive power as one that “prohibits or condemns,” and a compulsory force as one which “exerts some coercive force.” As a result, all of those military actions are prohibited under the PCA as applied to civilians.

Although immigration judges are, by regulation, impartial arbiters of the law, both temporary and permanent immigration judges carry out activities that meet the Yunis standard. Immigration judges decide whether an immigrant has the legal right to remain in the United States or will be deported, and whether to keep someone in custody or release them from detention. While the JAGs serving as immigration judges may be in civilian attire and judicial robes, they are issuing rulings that effectively control the immigrant’s future in the United States, prohibit the immigrant from being released from custody, and coerce the immigrant through deportation orders. Immigration judges don’t just apply the law—they execute it. When a judge orders deportation, that’s not interpretation, it’s compulsion backed by state power. Under the Yunis precedent, that’s precisely what the PCA prohibits.

In August of 1986, then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) Samuel Alito analyzed a proposal to assign Army JAGs to serve as Special U.S. Attorneys (SAUSAs) in the DOJ. In considering whether the assignments violated the PCA, Alito broadly interpreted “execution” of the law to encompass “the litigation of civil and criminal cases.” Immigration adjudication and decision-making¾which result in restrictions on liberty and the enforcement of applicable immigration laws that could lead to expulsion from the nation¾fall within this conception. In fact, Alito assumed without further analysis that the litigation of civil and criminal cases constituted “execution” of the law within the meaning of the PCA.

As Alito put it, the PCA was “intended to prevent persons subject to military law and discipline from directing commands to ordinary citizens.” Military lawyers serving as temporary immigration judges would have the ability to wield significant control over the lives of civilians, a power the PCA does not permit.

No Express Authorization

The only exception to the PCA’s prohibition on soldiers serving as civilian law enforcement is where the Constitution or Congress has “expressly authorized” them to do so. The Constitution does not include any express authorization that allows military officers to serve in civilian roles. There are many statutory exceptions to the PCA, but none expressly authorize the use of military lawyers as immigration judges in the DOJ.

The term “expressly authorized” is significant. Its inclusion was debated and discussed for several years before the PCA’s passage in 1878. The House Manager at the time said that inclusion of the word “expressly” was critical to prevent the use of the military where authority is only implied. During the back and forth between the Senate and the House on the PCA’s text, “expressly” was added in the final version, thus “restoring to this bill the principle for which we have contended so long, and which is so vital to secure the rights and liberties of the people.”

The Pentagon itself does not identify any exceptions that would permit assignment of JAGs as immigration judges. Its 2019 instruction governing interpretation of the PCA, titled “Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies,” lists 20 specific exceptions—including assignments as specific as the enforcement of fishery laws—but does not include any exceptions that even arguably include immigration adjudications. Even the so-called assignment statutes—10 USC §§ 806 and 973(b)(2)(B) – which allow military officers to support certain civil functions — are not considered by the military to be exceptions to the PCA. To be sure, the Trump administration could change how it interprets existing statutes and regulations, but such an interpretation is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act, and the court can set aside arbitrary or capricious changes that lack a reasoned explanation.

The omission of any reference to assignments to serve as immigration judges is evidence that the Deapartment of Defense does not consider such assignments to be exceptions to the PCA. If DOD doesn’t believe these are express exceptions, why should courts? Indeed, a court reviewing DOD’s newfound interpretation of a PCA exception is likely to apply administrative law principles to scrutinize this 180-degree interpretive turn, reviewing “the validity of [DOD’s] reasoning” and identifying its lack of “consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.”

Of note, in his 1986 OLC memo, Alito did not address whether the Title 10 provisions were an express exception to the PCA, but noted that the legality of using JAGs to carry out certain litigating functions at DOJ depended on certain factual circumstances. According to Alito, serious questions would arise under the PCA if, while assigned to DOJ, the military lawyers functioned under their usual military chain of command, were assigned on a part-time basis, or performed civilian functions along with their regularly assigned military duties (by working at a military installation, for example). Alito wrote that to minimize the risk of contravening the PCA, “military lawyers who are not functioning in an entirely civilian environment should not be used to perform any prosecutorial function that involves direct contact with civilians in a law enforcement context, such as the interrogation of witnesses or a personal appearance in court.”

In sum, the term “expressly” was fought over and included in the PCA’s text as a means to combat future attempts to allow the military to perform civil functions with only implied authority. The Pentagon has never interpreted the assignment statutes as express authorization to circumvent PCA restrictions, nor has it identified any other applicable exception.

Due Process Concerns

When JAGs are assigned as immigration judges, they remain subject to military law and discipline via the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Unlike military judges—who enjoy statutory insulation from command influence under Articles 26 & 37—JAGs assigned as immigration judges lack protections to shield their decisions from outside influence, thus creating an inherent conflict between judicial independence and command obedience.

First, under Article 26 of the UCMJ, only the senior Judge Advocates General of the Military Services may supervise military judges, and no one else may participate in their professional evaluation of their judicial performance. This carveout for military judges helps ensure judicial independence, insulating JAGs from external influence or pressure to decide a specific way. No such protection exists for JAGs serving as immigration judges, leaving them open to outside political pressure to support the administration’s mass deportation agenda. For example, JAGs serving as immigration judges lack any such protections and may well report to civilian bosses. These civilian bosses will have input on their professional evaluations. Imagine a JAG serving as an immigration judge who issues opinions that run contrary to the administration’s political agenda, angering his or her civilian bosses. A negative evaluation can sink an otherwise promising military career, creating an unworkable conflict of interest as JAGs attempt to balance career progression with commitment to due process and the rule of law.

Second, Article 37 of the UCMJ prohibits unlawful command influence of military justice proceedings, thereby ensuring independence and impartiality through the court-martial. Again, no statutory carveout exists to help insulate JAGs serving as immigration judges. Although unlawful command influence protections would not apply in immigration court, the threat of placing the thumb on the scale of deportation from senior officials is real and deeply problematic. Orders from their chain of command would have a high presumption of lawfulness¾only “manifestly illegal” orders must be disobeyed.

In light of the Trump administration’s focus on immigration enforcement and the clear executive branch preference to expedite deportation proceedings, JAGs serving as immigration judges are likely to feel outside pressure to favor the government’s view. They may even receive express pressure to rule a certain way, raising significant questions as to whether immigrants appearing before them will receive a fair hearing consistent with their Due Process rights.

Even the appearance of partiality could have significant consequences. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated more than two years of orders in a capital case against a man charged with orchestrating a series of bombing plots for al-Qaeda because the military judge overseeing the case failed to disclose that he had applied for an immigration position at the DOJ. The court found that the application to the DOJ, while serving as a military judge, created a “disqualifying appearance of partiality.” The same could happen here, undermining the administration’s goal of reaching finality.

Sidelining JAGs From Their First Priority

Finally, detailing JAGs as immigration judges takes those lawyers away from critical military work while demanding familiarity with the complex legal field of immigration law.

Since Trump took office in January, JAGs who have served for decades through different administrations, have witnessed their most senior uniformed leaders fired. Meanwhile, in the Defense Department, military lawyers are being sidelined from providing legal advice on operational decisions. The loss of 600 JAGs to immigration courts would be a stunning loss of expertise at a time when military legal advice is vital. With fewer JAGs, there is less candid and non-partisan legal advice, creating an environment that allows legally suspect behavior.

Second, assigning JAGs without immigration experience to serve as immigration judges is unfair to both the JAGs and to the immigrants appearing before the court. Immigration law is a notoriously complex, nuanced, and sophisticated area of law. Although JAGs have expertise in military justice, operational law, and laws of war, immigration law has never been a core specialty or practice area for JAGs. Many JAGs assigned as immigration judges will be reading immigration statutes, regulations, and case law for the first time. While we do not doubt that these military attorneys will do their very best despite the lack of subject matter expertise, immigrants before the court are entitled to competent judges who are well-versed in immigration law.

Conclusion

The unprecedented assignment of “soldiers in robes” to oversee civilian courts blurs the line between military and civilian functions. This intrusion into civilian affairs undermines the public’s trust and confidence in the military¾a hard-earned trust that has been slowly rebuilt since the Vietnam War.

The stakes could not be higher. After all, opposition to military entanglements in civilian affairs was a bedrock principle to the United States’ founding, with the Declaration of Independence lamenting the king’s willingness to “render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.”

This is not about the qualifications or credentials of JAGs. We know that most military lawyers – like most immigration judges – will do their best to remain impartial and ethical under trying circumstances, even without sufficient training and legal protections. But these moves create unnecessary risk.

DOJ should return to its 2014 requirements for temporary immigration judges and require immigration or adjudicatory experience – or both – for temporary immigration judges. To ensure due process for immigrants appearing in immigration court and to protect JAGs from prosecution under the PCA, DOJ should immediately take active duty JAGs off the immigration bench. Finally, the courts must resist any attempt to normalize military participation in civilian adjudications. Preserving this line is essential not only for legal compliance but for maintaining the trust that underpins a healthy civil-military balance.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/military-justice-dog-tags-scaled-e1581692818850-1024x425-e1593433819428.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:58:29.923175

IMMIGRATION SHOWDOWN: Federal judges in Chicago on Wednesday addressed the Trump administration’s immigration tactics. In back-to-back hearings, one judge ordered the government to begin freeing hundreds of detainees swept up in recent raids, while another oversaw the arraignment of six protesters — including Democratic politicians — accused of obstructing an ICE vehicle outside a suburban holding center.

Midwest flashpoint: Both hearings unfolded at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse and underscored how the Midwest has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s immigration campaign — and in the legal battles testing its limits.

In the morning session, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the release of more than 300 people detained by the federal government as part of Operation Midway Blitz being conducted in Illinois.

Pointing to violations: Plaintiffs’ attorneys say the government violated a federal consent decree by making arrests without warrants. Our story is here.

Imminent release: Cummings immediately ordered 13 people released by Friday after the Justice Department acknowledged their arrests ran afoul of that consent decree. He also told the government to produce, by Nov. 19, a list detailing how many of the 615 detainees covered by the class action remain in custody — and which, if any, have criminal records that justify mandatory detention.

Cummings said evidence so far suggests that “the vast majority” of those arrested were not dangerous criminals. Many, he noted, were detained while working, commuting or buying supplies — one even in a Dunkin’ Donuts.

Soon after in another courtroom, six activists, including congressional hopeful Kat Abughazaleh, Cook County Board candidate Cat Sharp, Oak Park Trustee Brian Straw and Democratic committeeperson Michael Rabbitt, pleaded not guilty to federal conspiracy charges.

Prosecutors say the group surrounded and damaged a federal agent’s SUV outside the Broadview ICE processing center, forcing it to crawl forward while protesters banged on the vehicle and allegedly carved the word “PIG” into the paint.

Serious charges: Each defendant faces up to seven years in prison. Their arraignment drew a crowd in Federal Plaza, where supporters rallied against what they called political prosecution. Abughazaleh denounced the case as “lawfare” against citizens’ dissent, while Sharp said the government “is violating our Constitution and our human rights.” More here from WTTW’s Matt Masterson

Their defense lawyers argued the charges stretch conspiracy law to criminalize collective protest. “By standing together — even spontaneously — they’re accused of plotting,” attorney Josh Herman told reporters. “That’s not a crime. That’s the First Amendment.”

U.S. Magistrate Judge Heather McShain declined prosecutors’ request to seize the defendants’ passports, agreeing instead to release them on bond.

The big picture: The two cases — one focused on federal behavior and the other on protest rights — reveal the deepening divide between Washington and Illinois when it comes to enforcement of immigration policy.

THE BUZZ

Just hours after Patty Garcia kicked off her campaign for Illinois’ 4th Congressional District, controversy erupted in D.C. on the House floor.

Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state took the rare step of publicly rebuking outgoing Congressman Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, accusing him of “undermining the process of a free and fair election” through what she called a backroom maneuver that left his longtime chief of staff, Patty Garcia (not related), with a near uncontested path to replace him.

POLITICO’s Katherine Tully-McManus Nicholas Wu have the story.

Gluesenkamp Perez’s move created a stir inside the Democratic caucus.

Congressman Garcia released a statement calling for “compassion.” He was referring to the reasons for his sudden decision not to run: a cardiologist warning him to slow down, his wife battling MS and the death of their daughter a few years ago, which prompted them to adopt a grandchild.

These are issues Garcia has been facing for a while, so his withdrawal from the congressional race isn’t sitting well. Political analyst David Axelrod called it “machine tactics.”

And Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, who’s now considering running as an independent for the seat, points out that Chuy Garcia came into Congress by a similar 11th-hour move when former Congressman Luis Gutierrez announced less than a week before the filing date that he wouldn’t seek reelection. “This announcement is not good for democracy,” Sigcho-Lopez told ABC 7’s Christian Piekos and Craig Wall.

A candidate undeterred: In her campaign kickoff, Patty Garcia called it a “whirlwind,” spontaneous decision but added, “it’s an open process” anyone could have applied.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT

Gov. JB Pritzker made a surprise appearance last night at the live taping of the Pivot Podcast with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway at the Chicago Theatre.

The governor took familiar jabs at President Donald Trump, primarily criticizing him for not understanding how Chicago or Illinois operates. But he also touched on a range of issues including the government shutdown, redistricting, cell phones in schools and Trump Tower in Chicago.

On redistricting: Pritzker reiterated that Illinois could pursue its own redistricting if neighboring Indiana, a Republican state, decides to act when it meets in December. “If Indiana does it … I think that will push Illinois,” he said.

On the shutdown vote: Pritzker expressed disappointment over Sen. Dick Durbin’s decision to advance a bill aimed at reopening the government, saying he was “disappointed” by the vote.

Calling cell phones “the biggest danger to young people in this country,” Pritzker said lawmakers plan to try again in the next legislative session to ban them in schools.

The biggest applause line: Pritzker took a swipe at Trump’s River North high-rise hotel and tower, saying, “He’s got such a bad rep with Chicago that if you ask most people, they’d like to tear the name Trump off the building.”

“We urge every member of Congress to join Rep. Grijalva in demanding the full release of the Epstein files and in standing firmly with those whose courage continues to drive the fight for truth.”","Representative Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, was sworn into office Wednesday by House Speaker Mike Johnson and took the opportunity to blast President Donald Trump and Congress.

Speaking to her colleagues on the House floor Wednesday, Grijalva said, “While we celebrate this moment today, our American promise is under serious threat.

“Basic freedoms are under attack. Health care premiums are skyrocketing. Babies are being ripped away from their parents by masked agents. We can and must do better.”

She then blamed Congress for not holding the Trump administration accountable for issues concerning affordable healthcare, immigration raids and more.

“What is most concerning is not what this administration has done, but what the majority in this body has failed to do — hold Trump accountable as a coequal branch of government that we are,” Grijalva said.

Grijalva also took her time on the floor to address her delayed swearing-in.

“It has been 50 days since the people of Arizona's seventh congressional district elected me to represent them. Fifty days that over 800,000 Arizonans have been left without access to the basic services that every constituent deserves.

“This is an abuse of power. One individual should not be able to unilaterally obstruct the swearing in of a duly elected member of Congress for political reasons,” Grijalva said in an apparent jab at Johnson.

Johnson has been accused of stalling the ceremony amid the ongoing government shutdown, as Grijalva is key to forcing a vote on the release of documents relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The speaker has denied such allegations.

The Trump administration came under fire earlier this year for what critics said was a lack of transparency when it came to the so-called Epstein files.

Some have accused Trump, who was Epstein’s friend decades ago, of being in the files, to explain why the White House has been so adamant on moving on from what the president has called a “hoax.”

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released email exchanges earlier Wednesday in which Epstein allegedly told his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump “spent hours” at his house with one of Epstein’s victims.

Asked about it, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “These emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”

Grijalva mentioned the emails during her speech on the House floor and said, “It's past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we, the American people ... That is why I will sign the discharge petition right now to release the Epstein files.”

The newly sworn-in congresswoman is the last signature needed on Representatives Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna’s (D-Calif.) discharge petition to force the House to vote on the release of the Epstein files.

Massie celebrated getting all 218 signatures on his petition, writing on X, “In spite of a last ditch effort by the President to foil the motion, and @SpeakerJohnson’s propaganda, the discharge petition I have been leading just succeeded!”

Top Trump administration officials met in the White House Situation Room earlier Wednesday with Representative Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican who signed the petition, The New York Times reported.

If the House votes to release the files, the bill would still need to be passed by the Senate, and signed by Trump.

Khanna thanked survivors of Epstein’s abuse, who he said made the successful discharge petition possible.

“Let’s bring it to the floor for a vote!” he wrote on X.

Grijalva won a special election on September 23 for the seat vacated by the passing of her father, former Representative Raúl Grijalva, who died in March during his 12th term in Congress.

Speaking to MSNBC’s Jen Psaki Wednesday night, Grijalva called for bipartisan legislation “to ensure that no duly elected member ever goes through this again,” referring to her delayed swearing-in.

Lauren Hersh, national director of the anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, congratulated Grijalva “on her swearing-in and on her resolve to sign the Epstein discharge petition, a crucial step toward uncovering the full truth about Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and the systems that enabled their abuse.”

“Survivors who have worked with World Without Exploitation were proud to stand with Congresswoman Grijalva today as she demonstrated her commitment to transparency and justice,” Hersh said.

“We urge every member of Congress to join Rep. Grijalva in demanding the full release of the Epstein files and in standing firmly with those whose courage continues to drive the fight for truth.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/af361a969be068e83c34e174fe721ab0,N,,2025-11-13 09:57:43.444854

Between 2022 and 2023 alone, more than 13,000 newly arrived immigrant students entered New York City’s public school system.
Most were identified as ELL students, bringing the total number to over 134,000—17 percent of the district’s entire student population.
A Broader National Struggle Adriana Cadena, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition, explained to NPQ that the challenge in meeting immigrant students’ needs extends far beyond New York City.
The statewide teacher shortage tends to disproportionately affect schools with the highest number of ELL students, according to LPI.","In the United States, the lack of interpreters, bilingual teachers, and English Language Learner (ELL) programs leaves many immigrant children without the linguistic support they need to learn, a problem only exacerbated by recent cuts to US Department of Education by the administration of President Donald Trump.

The absence of interpreters and translators directly affects the relationship between immigrant families and schools. Parents who do not speak English face barriers when enrolling their children, attending school meetings, and reviewing disciplinary processes. In the classroom, students without linguistic support are excluded from curricular content, impacting both academic performance and emotional wellbeing.

An audit released in September 2025 by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander found that some ELL students in the city “did not receive or were delayed in receiving services to which they were entitled to, and, ultimately, did not have equal access to school programs and services.”

Students without linguistic support are excluded from curricular content, impacting both academic performance and emotional wellbeing.

New York City is hardly the only school system that struggles to meet student language access needs. Indeed, with federal anti-immigrant campaigns a centerpiece of the Trump administration, the political space to pursue policy changes more locally has been limited.

Tracing the Struggle for Language Access in New York City

There are about 815,000 students enrolled in New York City Public Schools, making the district easily the largest public school system in the country, followed by Los Angeles Unified School District (at 419,929 students) and Miami-Dade County Public Schools (at 335,500 students).

It is also a school system with one of the highest concentrations of students who speak a first language other than English. Immigration is one driver of this. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, more than 13,000 newly arrived immigrant students entered New York City’s public school system. Most were identified as ELL students, bringing the total number to over 134,000—17 percent of the district’s entire student population. Yet institutional resources did not expand proportionally.

From the perspective of many community organizations—such as Masa (formerly the Mexican American Students’ Alliance), the New York Immigration Coalition, and the Coalition for Asian American Children and Families—the shortage of certified teachers in bilingual and ELL programs cannot be understood as a mere technical gap. It is a direct expression of current policy, which sadly allows school systems to get away with failing to provide children and youth with adequate learning conditions.

Hearings before the New York City Council’s Committee on Education in March 2025 revealed a growing concern over school attendance rates of newly arrived immigrant children.

While exact figures are not yet available, council members and city Department of Education officials acknowledged in the hearings that more than 1,000 immigrant students may have dropped out or disengaged from school in the fall of 2024. The hearing highlighted how fear of deportation, unstable housing, and lack of language access will further contribute to chronic absenteeism and educational exclusion, particularly after Trump’s election.

Councilmember Shahana Hanif emphasized: “I fear that right now with, of course, Trump’s mass deportation agenda, you know, I have constituents who share that they’re afraid to send their kids to school, and I know our school community is one of the safest communities for families.”

The educational gap is not simply a matter of logistics—it reflects a broader political refusal to invest in immigrants as part of the public.

A Broader National Struggle

Adriana Cadena, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition, explained to NPQ that the challenge in meeting immigrant students’ needs extends far beyond New York City.

“The lack of institutional resources is part of a broader, systematic effort by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress to deny immigrant families the basics every family needs to thrive. Yes, education, but also healthcare, food, and a safe place to live,” Cadena pointed out. “And not just people who are undocumented—about half of the people in immigrant families are US citizens, so attacks on immigrant families are attacks on millions of US citizens.”

Regardless of rising enrollment of multilingual students, many districts nationwide lack the certified staff, sustained funding, and inclusive policies needed to meet immigrant students’ needs. The educational gap is not simply a matter of logistics—it reflects a broader political refusal to invest in immigrants as part of the public.

School systems in Texas and California—two states with large immigrant populations—exemplify these structural challenges in ensuring linguistic access.

In Texas, more than 1.1 million ELL students were enrolled in the 2022–2023 academic year, representing nearly 20 percent of the state’s total student body. A 2023 Texas Education Agency report stated: “The number of students receiving language services increased across all regions of the state, with a particular concentration in border districts.” Despite Texas’s long-standing bilingual education tradition, certified-teacher shortages and regional disparities in service quality persist.

In California, over 1 million students were classified as ELLs during the same period, accounting for 18 percent of all public school students in the state. According to the Learning Policy Institute (LPI), nearly 40 percent of K–12 students come from households where a language other than English is spoken, and many remain in ELL programs for years without achieving expected proficiency. This category of “long-term English learners” poses a structural challenge for the state education system. The statewide teacher shortage tends to disproportionately affect schools with the highest number of ELL students, according to LPI.

Xilonin Cruz-Gonzalez is deputy director of Californians Together, a statewide coalition that advocates for equitable educational policies for English learners in California. From her perspective, the shortage of qualified teachers for English learners is deeply tied to systemic underinvestment in teacher preparation—both at the state and federal levels.

“The federal government—under the current presidential administration—is actively attempting to eliminate Title III funding, which provides direct support to school districts serving English learners and immigrant students,” Cruz-Gonzalez told NPQ. “These federal dollars are essential for districts to meet their legal obligations and provide adequate services to newcomer populations. Without this funding, it will be extremely difficult for schools to maintain the level of support required under federal law.”

Growing Multilingualism Despite Declining Resources

The national trends are telling. Students are increasingly multilingual, but educational systems are not adapting at the speed or depth required. Moreover, public education budgets continue to face pressure from reallocations toward infrastructure and school safety.

“When English learners receive the supports that they need in the proper time…then they can often go on to outperform their general education peers.”

Meanwhile, advocacy organizations are calling for structural reform that recognizes multilingualism as a pillar of inclusion rather than a barrier. This perspective is explicitly supported by UnidosUS and United We Dream. Both organizations emphasize the strategic and identity-affirming role of multilingual education.

UnidosUS, in its report From Practice to Policy: English Learners and Multilingual Learners in California, outlines concrete reforms, including expanded Title III funding, investment in culturally and linguistically responsive curricula, educator training that builds on students’ home languages, and family engagement through translated communications.

Lina Lenis, a policy analyst at UnidosUS whose focus is K–12 education, emphasized to NPQ the critical role that federal funding plays in supporting ELL students. As Lenis pointed out, “When English learners receive the supports that they need in the proper time…then they can often go on to outperform their general education peers.”

Lenis pointed out that beyond funding, schools have concrete tools that can enhance ELL students’ education. These include ensuring that caregivers meaningfully participate in parent-teacher conferences, receive clear information about special education or gifted and talented services, and access communication channels that respect their linguistic needs.

Engaging families, she added, especially those with limited English proficiency, strengthens academic achievement and overall student wellbeing.

Similarly, United We Dream, through its Education Justice program, has published reports that affirm the value of multilingual access to school services. The organization also promotes learning environments where students’ home languages are not only respected but actively integrated into instruction.

Strategies to Counter Fear

The current language access gap is emblematic of a broader climate of fear. In recent months, schools in New York and other major cities have begun preparing for potential immigration enforcement by implementing Know Your Rights training, drafting emergency protocols, and coordinating with legal aid organizations.

These efforts, while necessary, underscore a troubling reality: Instead of focusing on instruction and inclusion, schools are being forced to anticipate federal actions that directly impact their students’ sense of safety and belonging. The classroom, far from being a neutral space, becomes a frontline where immigration policy is felt daily.

For Cruz-Gonzalez, it’s essential that school districts create positive environments where families can feel safe. She pointed to concrete examples of how school communities work toward that goal. “LA Unified, at the beginning of the school year, they were using their staff to make sure that families had safe passage to school,” she said. “There are safe routes for families to go from their houses to schools. So, those are some of the things that schools can do to actively ensure that families feel comfortable.”",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Language_Access_school_girl.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:58:05.755426

Of the 48 law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements contacted by the Lookout, only the Rutherford and Greene County Sheriff’s offices responded.","When President Donald Trump took office in January for a second term, just two Tennessee sheriffs had entered voluntary agreements to assist the federal government in immigration enforcement.

Tennessee is now one of a handful of states seeing the biggest expansion of immigration agreements in the nation, along with Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Virginia.

Today, 48 local and state law enforcement agencies in Tennessee have signed onto so-called 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

They include 38 county sheriffs’ office, three small-town police departments and five east Tennessee constable districts. Constable districts typically consist of one unsalaried individual who is paid fees to serve warrants.

Two state agencies, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security and the Department of Corrections, have also entered into 287(g) agreements, extending immigration enforcement powers to designated state highway patrol officers and prison guards.

The rapid spread of ICE agreements significantly expands the reach of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement and deportation agenda into interior states like Tennessee, where immigrants without legal status represent an estimated 2.2% of the population.

Proponents of the agreements say the force multiplier effect of 287(g) agreements, by enlisting police officers, state troopers, emergency management officials, jailers, constables and prison guards, enhance community safety and more broadly enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

“I decided to do this as there is a right way to enter our country and a wrong way,” said Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt, who in 2019 initiated one of the state’s earliest existing agreements.

“It is a slap in the face for those who have been properly vetted and went through the naturalization process,” Holt said via email to the Lookout.

But critics of 287(g) agreements have called them an ominous extension of Trump administration tactics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Memphis and elsewhere that rely on racial profiling to engage in widespread arrests and detentions of immigrants with no criminal records.

Immigrant advocates have long criticized 287(g) agreements for a history of racial profiling allegations, redirecting police to engage in low-level immigration violations instead of community safety and tasking police officers with limited training to interpret complex immigration laws.

“The Trump administration has really converted most of government – Homeland Security and much of the Department of Justice – to do immigration enforcement,” said Lena Graber, senior staff attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which advocates for immigrant rights.

“Are we just outsourcing all of our local officials to the federal government and its agenda?” she said.

‘Unprecedented reimbursement opportunities’

Tennessee agencies that have partnered with ICE in recent months may have powerful incentives.

ICE agreements in the past have come with no financial compensation beyond training provided by federal authorities and IT equipment allowing communication with federal immigration databases.

But the Trump administration included $14 billion in federal funding in the Big Beautiful Bill Act in July to fund financial incentives for local and state law enforcement agencies who agreed to ink 287(g) deals by Oct. 1.

They include full reimbursement for the annual salary, benefits and overtime for each 287(g) trained officer, $7,500 for laptops and cell phones per trained officer and up to $100,000 toward the purchase of agency vehicles.

Participating law enforcement agencies are also eligible for bonuses that range from $500 to $1,000 per officer based on meeting benchmarks for the “successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICDE’s mission to Defend the Homeland.”

“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” Madison Sheahan, ICE Deputy Director, said in a message to potential state and local partners.

In September the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 330,000 officers across the nation, urged police departments to enter 287(g) agreements to take advantage of the unprecedented funding opportunities.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the amount or timing of potential reimbursements to Tennessee law enforcement agencies.

Memorandum of Agreement documents establishing agreements between Tennessee local and state law enforcement entities explicitly say that 287(g) activities will be carried out at the local law enforcement agency’s expense.

But the agreements establishing so-called “task force models,” which provide the most expansive level of cooperation with the federal government, include an additional clause: “Whether or not the (local agency) receives financial reimbursement for such costs through a federal grant or other funding mechanism is not material” to the agreement.

Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux recently rejected the offer of $25 million by ICE to reimburse the city for the salaries, benefits and overtime of officers who participate in a 287(g), saying the partnership would divert officers from their primary responsibilities. The offer from ICE came with the condition that Dallas officers arrest at least 50 immigrants a day, Comeaux said.

Tennessee lawmakers, in a special session that convened last year, also approved incentives for agencies that partner with ICE, offering $5 million in grants to local law enforcement agencies that enter 287(g) agreements. Questions about the status of distribution of the state funds went unanswered by the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security.

Small town police to become immigration ‘task forces’

State and local law enforcement agencies can opt to enter one of three different model agreements with ICE.

They include a “jail enforcement” agreement that gives local officials the authority to investigate the immigration status of individuals who are already incarcerated.

A spokesperson for Rutherford County Sheriff Mike Fitzhugh, who faced community pushback when his county’s jail enforcement agreement was made public, stressed the work his deputies did would remain unchanged.

“He is entering a memorandum of understanding with ICE, a continuation of what the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center has done with ICE since 1996,” the spokesperson said. “This memo will allow the deputies to have access to a federal data base.”

Tennessee law already requires local jails to cooperate with ICE officials to verify the immigration status of individuals coming into custody.

A “warrant service officer” agreement allows jailers to serve immigration warrants that authorize the arrest of individuals for civil immigration violations on those in their custody.

Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

The “task force” model gives local and state law enforcement officers powers to enforce immigration law on routine patrols and traffic stops — the most expansive delegation of immigration enforcement powers.

Thus far, 12 Tennessee state and local law enforcement agencies have adopted the task force model, including the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol.

Other task force agreements with ICE include three constable districts in Bradley County, one constable district in Monroe County and one in Polk County.

Constable districts consist of one elected official who serves as a process server for local courts. They are not required to have police training, but the jobs are often filled by former police officers.

Constables in Bradley, Monroe and Polk Counties did not respond to questions from the Lookout.

The statement came as a growing number of bishops have acknowledged that some of the Trump administration’s immigration policies risk presenting the church with both practical challenges in administering pastoral support and charitable endeavors, as well as religious liberty challenges.

U.S. bishops responding to “the people we serve”

Archbishop Richard G. Henning of Boston told OSV News in an interview that the feeling “we have to say something” on the subject of showing solidarity with immigrants has been “kind of bubbling up from the bishops.”

“Obviously, the beliefs of the church have political consequences, but they’re not political in the usual sense of the word,” he said. “And so there was a real effort to make sure that this would be a pastoral address to our people rather than an attempt to lobby.”

Despite differences in age, geography or other viewpoints, Archbishop Henning said, the U.S. bishops have almost universally heard from parishioners or pastors about “suffering the effects of this.”

“We’re pastors,” he said. “We care about the people we serve, and what we’re hearing from them is fear and suffering. So it’s hard not to want to respond to that.”

USCCB immigration statement released Nov. 12

The statement, released in the late afternoon, said, “As pastors, we the bishops of the United States are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in Our Lord Jesus Christ.”

“We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,” it said. “We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care. We lament that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status.

“We are troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship and the special nature of hospitals and schools,” it continued. “We are grieved when we meet parents who fear being detained when taking their children to school and when we try to console family members who have already been separated from their loved ones. Despite obstacles and prejudices, generations of immigrants have made enormous contributions to the well-being of our nation.

“We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity. For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of human dignity.”

Balancing Catholic social teaching: Right to migrate, right of border regulation, duty to justice and mercy

The statement also refers to Catholic social teaching on immigration, which seeks to balance three interrelated principles: the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain themselves and their families; the right of a country to regulate its borders and immigration; and a nation’s duty to conduct that regulation with justice and mercy.

For example, Archbishop Henning told OSV News that “Catholic teaching doesn’t like chaos, because chaos often produces great injustice for the most vulnerable.”

“But it’s possible to go too far the other way too,” he said.

Catholic teaching “exhorts nations to recognize the fundamental dignity of all persons, including immigrants,” the statement said. “We bishops advocate for a meaningful reform of our nation’s immigration laws and procedures. Human dignity and national security are not in conflict.

“Both are possible if people of good will work together. We recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good. Without such processes, immigrants face the risk of trafficking and other forms of exploitation. Safe and legal pathways serve as an antidote to such risks.”

The church’s teaching, it noted, “rests on the foundational concern for the human person, as created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27).”

“As pastors, we look to Sacred Scripture and the example of the Lord Himself, where we find the wisdom of God’s compassion,” it continued. “The priority of the Lord, as the Prophets remind us, is for those who are most vulnerable: the widow, the orphan, the poor, and the stranger (Zachariah 7:10). In the Lord Jesus, we see the One who became poor for our sake (2 Corinthians 8:9), we see the Good Samaritan who lifts us from the dust (Luke 10:30–37), and we see the One who is found in the least of these (Matthew 25).

“The Church’s concern for neighbor and our concern here for immigrants is a response to the Lord’s command to love as he has loved us (John 13:34),” it said.

Bishops approve statement with standing ovation

The message was approved by the vast majority of voting bishops and was met with a standing ovation. Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, newly elected president of the USCCB, spoke in favor of the statement from the floor, saying, “I’m strongly in support of it for the good of our immigrant brothers and sisters,” adding that the statement sought “balance” in “protecting the rights of immigrants, but also securing and calling upon our lawmakers and our administration to offer us a meaningful path of reform for our immigration system.”

According to a USCCB news release issued with the text of the statement, this “marked the first time” in 12 years the bishops’ conference “invoked this particularly urgent way of speaking as a body of bishops. The last one issued in 2013 was in response to the federal government’s contraceptive mandate.”

Statement details debated on assembly floor

Details of the statement were a matter of some debate at the public session Nov. 12, with Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago suggesting the addition of language opposing “indiscriminate mass deportation.” Others voiced concurrence but raised qualifications, like also adding “without due process,” or questioned the conference’s procedures for making an amendment at the assembly. The added phrase was ultimately approved, and is found in the final paragraph of the message: “We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement. We pray that the Lord may guide the leaders of our nation, and we are grateful for past and present opportunities to dialogue with public and elected officials. In this dialogue, we will continue to advocate for meaningful immigration reform.”

The bishops’ concern has a reference point in existing magisterial teaching. St. John Paul II’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” that names “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

St. John Paul underscored that these acts were examples of “intrinsic evil” incapable of being ordered to God or the good of the human person.

Immigration statement shows “a fundamental unity among us”

When the U.S. bishops ultimately approved the language after some debate, Archbishop Henning quipped, “The amended amendment passes.”

In his interview with OSV News after the vote, Archbishop Henning said, “It’s not an easy thing to kind of get us all moving completely in the same direction.” But he said the overwhelming support for the message showed “a fundamental unity among us.”

“I think there was a pretty powerful sense among all the bishops that what we’re experiencing on the ground in our dioceses is that there’s a great deal of suffering and confusion, and I would say even chaos,” he said. “There’s kind of arbitrariness right now, in the experience of the people, that generates pretty significant fear.”

Kat Abughazaleh, a leading voice among anti-immigration enforcement protesters in Chicago and a candidate for Illinois’ Ninth Congressional District, was indicted along with five others on charges of assaulting, resisting and impeding federal officers. At a protest on Sept. 26, Abughazaleh and others stood in front of an immigration enforcement SUV entering a Homeland Security facility in the suburbs.

The 26-year-old’s court appearance on charges connected to fighting Trump’s promised mass deportation campaign comes at a moment where Chicagoans opposed to the blitz have taken the administration to court and the president’s Justice Department has also taken locals to court amid resistance to enforcement efforts.

""For speaking up against those inhumane policies, I have been indicted,"" Abughazaleh said to supporters outside the courthouse. The congressional candidate spoke in front of a podium that read ""Defend the Broadview Six,"" a reference to the suburban village that houses an immigration processing center at the heart of the blitz. The Trump administration has tried to scare us into silence but look around, is it working?""

Dozens of supporters carrying signs opposed to immigration enforcement cheered in response.

""Do you want to live in a country where atorcities can happen because we can’t speak out? I don’t and I hope you don’t either,"" she said.

Others indicted Brian Straw, Catherine Sharp, Michael Rabbitt, Joselyn Walsh and Andre Martin also pleaded not guilty in court on Nov. 12 in the Northern District of Illinois.

The progressive’s court appearance over efforts to resist the Trump administration comes at a moment of reckoning in the Democratic Party, where many are divided over the move of moderate Democratic senators to end the government shutdown without securing the healthcare insurance benefits they promised voters.

Andrew S. Boutros, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, previously issued a statement on the charges.

""All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats,"" Boutros said. ""As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder, or impede the due administration of Justice.

Still, Fox spliced footage from 2020 into its coverage this year and claimed it was from 2025.","When President Donald Trump told reporters on Sept. 5 he’d started looking at sending the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, he said it was because of something he saw on television.

He said the city was being destroyed by paid agitators. “What they’ve done to that place, it’s like living in hell,” he said, a comment that became an internet meme as some Portland residents juxtaposed it with tranquil images of the city.

Trump didn’t say which channel he watched; he said at one point he saw something “today” and at another “last night.”

The evening before, on Sept. 4, Fox News aired a two-and-a-half-minute segment spotlighting protests outside a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland. Similar footage aired the morning of Trump’s remarks. The president went on to announce Sept. 27 on Truth Social that he would send troops, saying that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

He later said he’d told Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, that “unless they’re playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Your place is burning down.”

ProPublica examined months of Fox News’ coverage and reviewed more than 700 video clips posted to social media by protesters, counterprotesters and others in the three months preceding the Sept. 4 broadcast.

The review found that the news network repeatedly provided a misleading picture of what was happening in Portland.

As The Guardian and The Oregonian/OregonLive have reported, Fox News on Sept. 4 used footage from the 2020 protests after the police killing of George Floyd and said it was from 2025. We found two clear cases from that night as well as one that seemed to match a scene filmed at a key site of the 2020 protests. Fox also mislabeled two other dates of actions shown on screen, and one broadcast implied that a protest from elsewhere was happening in Portland.

Fox News chyrons about Portland the week of Trump’s remarks carried phrases like “violent demonstrators,” “protesters riot,” “anti-I.C.E. Portland rioters” and “war-like protests.” One host said protesters were attacking federal officers.

This portrayal of protesters as routinely instigating violence or rioting was also misleading.

As ProPublica reported last week, most clashes between protesters and police before the Fox News segment did not result in any criminal charges or arrests alleging protesters committed violence. What’s more, based on news releases from federal and local authorities, charges and arrests for assault, arson or destruction of property were almost entirely confined to a period that ended the night of July 4.

Videos after that date captured numerous images of federal officers forcefully moving in on protesters without corresponding criminal charges alleging protester violence.

A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security did not answer requests to comment on its officers’ tactics.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said of action on the ground in Portland: “This isn’t a peaceful protest that’s under control, like many on the left have claimed, it’s radical violence. President Trump is taking lawful action to protect federal law enforcement officers and address the out-of-control violence that local residents have complained about and Democrat leaders have failed to stop.”

Here’s how Fox News’ coverage of the Portland story was misleading.

Fox News Said It Was 2025. It Wasn’t.

Protests in 2020 in the wake of Floyd’s murder by a police officer attracted large, sometimes violent crowds to Portland — along with a federal law enforcement response authorized by Trump.

The protests outside the ICE facility have typically been far smaller. Still, Fox spliced footage from 2020 into its coverage this year and claimed it was from 2025.

The Fox News correspondent in the segment that aired the night Trump was watching TV said: “On this night in late June, police used tear gas.”

The accompanying image appears to be not from the ICE building but from the federal courthouse in downtown Portland, more than a mile away. A nearly identical scene was shown in a Fox News video five years earlier. Footage that aired Sept. 4, shot at a slightly different angle, blurs out spots where graffiti was visible on the building in Fox’s July 2020 broadcast.

Almost immediately after showing the courthouse scene, the segment cuts to another image as the correspondent says, “federal police used tear gas and flashbangs.”

On screen at that moment is a U.S. Navy veteran who was pepper-sprayed and repeatedly struck with a baton. But it didn’t happen in September 2025. The video was posted on social media on July 18, 2020.

The Fox News segment about the ICE protests soon shows an American flag burning.

That image was posted on social media July 16, 2020.

The location: the base of a downtown Portland statue more than a mile away from the ICE building where protests are happening in 2025.

On the webpage for its Sept. 4 video segment, Fox News added an editor’s note at least two weeks later: “This video contains footage from protests in Portland in 2020 and 2025.”

“Still Going On”

After mislabeling 2020 events as 2025, Fox’s Sept. 4 evening broadcast explicitly drew a connection between the two periods.

“The protest chaos, which began with riots aimed at social justice in 2020, has severely damaged Portland’s reputation,” the correspondent said.

The dramatic footage at this moment shows fires in the street and was broadcast on Fox on Aug. 19, 2020, the day after a crowd smashed through windows and set items on fire in the headquarters for the government of Multnomah County, where Portland is located.

We don’t know for certain which broadcast got Trump thinking about Portland. The White House did not respond to questions about what Trump watched. But the president said on Sept. 5 that what he’d seen about Portland on TV was “unbelievable.”

“I didn’t know that was still going on,” he said. “This has been going on for years.”

The reality: Portland’s 2020 social justice protests, which resulted in hundreds of arrests and continued for months, turned sporadic by early 2021. Protests in years since have led to occasional property damage, but nothing in Portland has matched the scale of events that followed Floyd’s death.

Portland police Chief Bob Day said at a Sept. 29 press conference that the city had been inaccurately portrayed through the lens of the protests in 2020 and 2021.

“What’s actually happening, and the response we’re seeing both from Portlanders and from the Portland Police Bureau,” Day said, “is not in line with that national narrative. And it is frustrating.”

A Riot That Wasn’t

In a Sept. 2 segment featuring the video from a day earlier, anchor Bill Hemmer said it shows “riots raging.” Anchor Trace Gallagher teased another Sept. 2 news segment by once again showing the video, saying, “It’s a riot outside a Portland ICE facility.”

The Sept. 4 segment shows Julie Parrish, an attorney for a neighbor of the ICE facility, accusing Portland police of saying, “Meh, we’re just gonna let violent rioters do this for 80 straight nights.”

The physical behavior of protesters that was captured on the video is not violent. The camera instead shows federal agents advancing on them. In the moments before officers tossed munitions into the crowd, videos show, one protester was blowing bubbles. The Portland police did not declare a riot, a legal designation that allows for an elevated police use of force. (They declared a riot just once, a police spokesperson said, on June 14.)

The Sept. 1 protest had “little to no energy,” according to an internal Portland police summary, before federal officers dispersed the crowd to collect a prop guillotine that had been brought. Katie Daviscourt, a Trump-aligned commentator who filmed the clips, noted on X that protesters were having dance parties and that their main problems were “not leaving restricted areas, burning a flag, and possessing a deadly object (guillotine).”

ProPublica found a similar pattern for the three months before Fox’s Sept. 4 broadcast: clashes that on most days and nights had no criminal allegations of protester violence to explain them.

After dozens of arrests and charges were announced in June through July 4, federal prosecutors accused just three people of crimes at the ICE building in the roughly two months leading up to Fox’s Sept. 4 broadcast.

During that same two-month time frame, ProPublica’s review found numerous instances of police using force: videos from more than 20 days or nights with federal officers grabbing, shoving, pepper-spraying, tackling, firing on or using other munitions on protesters.

No local arrests or federal criminal charges were announced on these days or nights, and only a handful of dates corresponded with incidents of protester aggression later asserted by federal authorities in their legal case for sending troops.

Asked whether Fox News accurately represented her footage, Daviscourt said: “I stand by my four months of accurate reporting.”

Parrish told ProPublica she had collected evidence that “shows ongoing and persistent activity” outside the facility that under statute and police directive “would be considered riotous, unlawful assembly and/or disorderly conduct.” She declined to share this evidence, saying it was privileged as part of her client’s file.

Her lawsuit on behalf of a neighbor living near the ICE facility, which sought to require police to enforce Portland’s noise ordinance, was dismissed.

The Reappearing Neighbor

A Sept. 5 “Fox & Friends” segment showed a neighbor from an apartment building confronting protesters over noise, shouting at protesters: “Turn that (bleep) down, it’s midnight! … We the people need sleep!”

Fox said it happened Tuesday, which would have been Sept. 2. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, “This has been going on for months now, but a lot of this since Labor Day,” as the video shown on screen sandwiches footage of the neighbor between other scenes from the Labor Day protest.

“This is a chaotic city,” co-host Brian Kilmeade said.

The next day, the clip of the neighbor appeared again on Fox News. This time, the network said the footage was from Wednesday, or Sept. 3.

In reality, the confrontation was captured on video months before. Daviscourt published the video on June 29 on X.

On the two September nights that Fox said the neighbor’s confrontation happened, ProPublica’s review found no videos of violent clashes posted on social media, and federal authorities announced no arrests.

For example, according to a Portland police email from 11:22 p.m. on Sept. 3: “There are still about 20 people hanging around but only 4 were even on the sidewalk in front of the building.”

Misrepresentations Continue After Trump’s Guard Order

On Sept. 28, the day Trump’s order was implemented, a Fox News broadcast played a clip of Kotek saying that Guard troops were not needed in Portland, then immediately cut to a clip of a hectic scene of protesters clashing with police.

“Wish she could see some of those images,” the anchor said. Sarcastically, as a co-anchor chuckled, she added: “Look at that. Just a peaceful protest.”

A small box on the screen showed the footage wasn’t from Oregon.

It was from Illinois.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110-Gordon-portland-protest-reality-social_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?resize=2000,1050",N,,2025-11-13 05:57:41.756736

It doesn’t help that House and Senate leaders still haven’t agreed on an overall total for fiscal 2026 spending, amid GOP divisions over how deeply to cut.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged this month that the hardest part of the funding negotiations is ahead after President Donald Trump signs the current deal to end the shutdown.

“We’ve got to just find a resolution to get the lights back on,” Scalise said. “But the real negotiation is going to be: Can we get an agreement on how to properly fund the government with individual appropriations bills, packages of appropriations bills?”

If lawmakers don’t figure it all out by the new January deadline, Congress risks another partial shutdown or running most of the federal government on what are essentially two-year-old budgets. Some Democrats are already hinting they are willing to shut down the government again without a deal on Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies that expire at the end of this year.

Compounding the challenge are fears that partisan strife during the six-week shutdown will only complicate the already-grueling task of striking a cross-party compromise.

“If we’re going to function again, we’ve got to be able to trust each other,” senior appropriator Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told reporters this week, after helping broker the deal to end the shutdown.

The three-bill deal appears to have done little to repair the breach. One of Congress’ top four appropriators, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), objected to how final negotiations played out over the weekend to close out the funding package.

“The entire House was marginalized in this process,” she said Tuesday night during a Rules Committee meeting.

DeLauro accused Senate Republicans of “abruptly” stopping talks in the middle of negotiations, making the bills public before she signed off and secretly adding controversial language without consulting House lawmakers.

In the Senate, leaders have committed to quickly advancing more funding measures. Majority Leader John Thune said senators would be “off to the races” on a second package of spending measures when the chamber gavels back in on Tuesday.

Up to five bills are under consideration for inclusion in that package, covering funding for the military and the departments of Education, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Justice, Transportation, Interior and Housing and Urban Development.

Getting that done will be hard enough. All 100 senators would have to consent to quickly assemble the bills on the floor, likely followed by weeks of debate before a vote on passage. Then top Senate appropriators would need to strike a compromise with their House counterparts.

But the remaining spending bills will be even tougher. Four are so divisive that Senate appropriators didn’t even approve them in committee this summer. Lawmakers in both parties agree it is likely that agencies covered under that slate — among them the departments of Energy, Homeland Security, State and Treasury, including the IRS — will eventually be funded through a stopgap that spans through next September.

Democrats warn that any partisan demands from Trump or hard-liners in the House could deadlock the effort to reach agreements on the nine bills left.

“If they want to add poison pills, obviously the whole thing will fall apart,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a senior appropriator, said in a brief interview.

But Democrats are also motivated to strike bipartisan deals in light of Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought’s moves this year to shift, freeze and cancel billions of dollars Congress already approved.

Senators have been careful to be more explicit in the new trio of funding bills about how the Trump administration must spend the money.

“Obviously, those are not the bills I would have written,” the Senate’s top Democratic appropriator, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, said in a floor speech this week. But those bills, she added, are “immeasurably better than Trump and Vought holding the pen.”

“We have a lot of work ahead, and I know we can get there — passing full-year funding bills to ensure Congress, not Trump or Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent,” she continued.

A couple of the remaining bills, however, are subject to much more profound disputes. An intraparty disagreement over funding levels between Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), for instance, has left the energy bill in limbo.

“I know that is a new experience for everybody on the committee,” Kennedy said this week. “But I’m not backing down.”

And then there’s the DHS measure, which hasn’t been unveiled, let alone advanced through committee amid a deep partisan dispute over curbing Trump’s immigration agenda.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the panel that funds DHS, said he wants “real constraints” to prevent what he calls the Trump administration’s “clearly illegal” transfers of funding to support border enforcement and mass deportations.

“It’s going to be really hard to get a bipartisan long-term budget,” Murphy said, pointing to $600 million the administration is now using for detaining immigrants despite Congress explicitly approving it for “non-detention” efforts.

Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, who has clashed with Murphy as his GOP counterpart on the panel, acknowledged appropriators have “a lot of hard work in front of us” when asked this week about the challenge of advancing the next tranche of spending bills.

State Representative David Gomberg (D-Otis) sent out a statement Wednesday saying that having the rapid response air rescue moved nearly 100 miles south to North Bend could mean a “matter of life and death in our cold waters.”

“Removal of air operations from Newport, with no notice, could not have come at a worse time with weather turning and the crab season beginning,” Gromberg said.

Gromberg said there is evidence that the federal government is pushing to open a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center at the airport.

KATU News first reported on Monday that city officials warned of plans for a possible ICE facility in Newport.

Among the evidence he cited is a letter of intent from Team Housing Solutions, a federal contractor, that looks to “utilize the property to support federal operations commencing at the Newport Municipal Airport on or around December 1.”

He also said a Lincoln County septic company received an inquiry from another federal contractor about what it would cost to pump 10,000 gallons of sewage a day out of tanks at the airport, saying the contract would last for up to three years.

The representative’s team also pointed to ads from Acuity International about hiring a clinical team of health professionals to work out of the airport site.

Rep. Gomberg and other lawmakers accused DHS of lacking in transparency and collaborative efforts with local officials.

“Reasonable people will have varying opinions on immigration policy,” said Rep. Gomberg. “But we should all agree that the bedrock of good government is transparency. I am calling on DHS and the Trump Administration to explain themselves to our community. If you want to turn our community into the West Coast epicenter of your immigration plans by December 1, then at the very least, you need to explain your plan and communicate with the people who you were sworn to serve. This isn’t how good or honest government operates, and we aren’t going to tolerate it.”

The Obamacare tax credits were created during Joe Biden’s presidency, and lowered premiums for enrollers of plans bought under the law.
It ended up funding the government through January and undoing the layoffs the Trump administration had ordered after the shutdown began.
But it included no additional funding for the Affordable Care Act tax credits – instead, Thune agreed to allow a vote on the issue by mid-December.
Enrollers in the plans received notices of premium increases in November because of the tax credits’ expiration.","The longest US government shutdown in history ended on Wednesday after more than 42 days, following the House of Representative’s passage of a bill negotiated by Republicans and a splinter group of Democrat-aligned senators.

The compromise sets the stage for government operations to return to normal through January, while leaving unresolved the issue of expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare health plans, which most Democrats demanded be extended in any deal to reopen the government.

After it was unveiled over the weekend, the Senate approved the compromise on Monday, and the House followed suit two days later by a margin of 222 in favor and 209 against, with two not voting. Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday night, saying “we’re sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was … the Democrats tried to extort our country”.

Six Democrats broke with their party to vote for the bill: Adam Gray of California, Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine. Two Republicans, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida, voted against it.

“The Democrat shutdown is finally over thanks to House and Senate Republicans,” House Republican leadership said in a statement.

“There is absolutely no question now that Democrats are responsible for millions of American families going hungry, millions of travelers left stranded in airports, and our troops left wondering if they would receive their next paycheck.”

In remarks on the House floor shortly before the vote, the Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries had pledged to continue to press for the subsidies’ extensions.

“This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” he said. “Either Republicans finally decide to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits this year, or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J Trump once and for all. That’s how this fight ends.”

The spending standoff was the biggest battle between congressional Democrats and Republicans since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. It resulted in unprecedented disruptions to government services, with the Trump administration ordering cuts to commercial air travel across the country, and the first-ever halt to the largest federal food aid program.

Reeling from their election defeats last year, Democrats had seized on an end-of-September expiration of government funding to make a stand on healthcare, a signature issue of the party over the past decade and a half. The Obamacare tax credits were created during Joe Biden’s presidency, and lowered premiums for enrollers of plans bought under the law.

Democrats wanted them extended as part of any deal to continue government funding. The party made other demands as well, including curbs on Trump’s use of rescissions to slash money Congress had previously authorized and an undoing of cuts to Medicaid which Republicans had approved earlier in the year. But as the battle went on, it became clear that an extension of the subsidies was the main objective.

Republicans, who control both the House and the Senate, counter-offered with a bill to fund the government through the third week of November, without any spending cuts or major changes to policy. They passed the measure through the lower chamber with only a single Democrat in support, but the minority used the Senate’s filibuster to block its passage there.

The shutdown began on 1 October, resulting in around 700,000 federal workers being furloughed. Hundreds of thousands of others, from active duty military to law enforcement to airport security screeners, remained on the job without pay.

Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director known for his hostility towards the federal workforce, seized on the funding lapse to order further layoffs of government employees. He also cut funding for infrastructure projects in states that voted for Kamala Harris last year.

Though Trump ordered military members be paid in a move that many experts called likely illegal, other federal workers missed paychecks. Food banks began reporting increased demand as the shutdown went on, with the need worsening after the White House halted payments under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, citing the government funding lapse.

Last week, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, ordered a cutback in flights at US airports, saying air traffic controllers were facing unprecedented strain after weeks of unpaid work. Widespread flight cancellations were reported in the days that followed.

In the Senate, most Democrats remained onboard with the party’s strategy for weeks. Senate majority leader John Thune held 14 votes on the GOP funding measure, but only three members of the minority caucus ever broke ranks to support it.

In early November, Democrats swept off-year elections, winning gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey by significant margins, as well as voter approval for new congressional maps in California that will help the party’s candidates.

Democratic leaders said the wins vindicated their strategy in the funding fight, a statement Trump echoed, saying “the shutdown is a big factor” in the GOP’s poor performance. He began pressing Republican senators to scrap the filibuster, which would have negated the 60-vote threshold spending legislation needs to clear in the chamber, where the GOP holds 53 seats.

Meanwhile, a small group of moderate members of the Senate Democratic caucus had been negotiating a compromise to end the shutdown. It ended up funding the government through January and undoing the layoffs the Trump administration had ordered after the shutdown began.

But it included no additional funding for the Affordable Care Act tax credits – instead, Thune agreed to allow a vote on the issue by mid-December. There’s no telling if it will win the GOP support needed to pass, and Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has not said he will put any legislation up for a vote.

Despite howls of outrage from both House and Senate Democrats, the Senate passed it with 60 votes on Monday: eight from lawmakers in the Democratic caucus, and the rest from Republicans.

Yet the fight over the ACA subsidies is unlikely to be over. Enrollers in the plans received notices of premium increases in November because of the tax credits’ expiration. One study predicted they would rise by an average of 26%, potentially bringing them to levels unaffordable to many.

With government funding expiring again at the end of January, Democrats could use the opportunity to again demand the subsidies be extended.

“Dozens of House Republicans have been claiming over the last few weeks that they know that is something that needs to be addressed,” Jeffries said in a Tuesday interview with CNN.

“And now we’re going to have to see some action or whether it was just talk from these House Republicans because Democrats are going to continue to stay in the arena as it relates to dealing with the healthcare crisis that Republicans have visited on the American people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e403f7d13d86efeb2a82704f6e3de7fe2a40b5/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2b1ca87ca3905c61edb623be801347b",N,,2025-11-13 05:57:17.944213

Despite a last minute push from President Donald Trump, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert kept her name on a discharge petition that would demand the full release of investigative files around convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Boebert met with Trump Administration officials at the White House Wednesday over her support for using a process that goes around GOP leadership to force a vote on releasing the files.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt confirmed Boebert’s meeting at a press conference Wednesday afternoon, saying it was about transparency.

“Doesn’t it show transparency that members of the Trump administration are willing to brief members of Congress, whenever they please?” Leavitt told an ABC reporter who asked whether the administration was meeting with Boebert in order to push her to take her name off the petition. “Doesn’t that show the level of transparency when we are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns?”

Boebert pushed back Wednesday night on the idea that the White House was trying to get her to remove her name from the petition, saying she did not feel any pressure.

“I love the White House,” Boebert told CPR News. “Adults are allowed to have conversations.”

Boebert said she had wanted more information and that she received more information.

“I want to honor President Trump’s legacy of transparency,” Boebert said. “I was assured today that this is an administration who's going to continue to be transparent and honest and we will see what comes of it. But there was no pressure and I mean, everybody was great.”

Boebert is one of four Republicans who signed the bipartisan discharge petition led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California to force the Justice Department to release all the files.

Boebert, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia all signed onto the petition on September 2. It remained one vote short until Wednesday afternoon when Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of New Mexico was sworn in and added her name.

Massie and Khanna sat together during the swearing in and stood up and clapped when it was announced she’d be the 218th signature. There were also two Epstein victims in the gallery watching.

Once a petition reaches 218 votes, it is frozen and no names can be added or removed.

Earlier in the day, Trump lashed out on social media at Republicans that supported the petition, writing Democrats are doing this to deflect from their failures.

“Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,” he wrote on Truth Social. “There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our country and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!”

Wednesday evening Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he will bring the bill to the floor next week for a vote.

If the bill passes the House, there’s no guarantee that the Senate would take it up and pass it there. But if it did, it would still have to be signed into law by Trump, who has referred to the effort as the “Epstein Hoax.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/AP23256651445487.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 05:57:37.519033

Mink said she was walking near a school when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers made what appears to be an arrest, and Mink began recording the events. Moments later, she was confronted by two officers.

The video, which Mink shared on Facebook, shows two men, who Mink said were ICE agents, making an arrest in Adelphi, just before 7:30 a.m.

You can hear the confrontation appear to escalate as the men get closer to Mink.

As they approach, Mink can be heard saying, “Don’t touch me,” as another man repeatedly says, “You got to go.”

One of the agents moves closer, grabbing at her left arm, and Mink said he grabbed her phone. She can be heard in the video saying, “Don’t touch my phone.”

“You got to go over there,” said one of the men, who appeared to have a holstered weapon.

The two men then back off, according to the video, and moments later get into two SUVs, one white and one black, and drive toward Mink.

“I’m behind Tick Tock Liquors, Monday morning. This vehicle looks like it’s about to drive into me,” Mink said in the video. The two vehicles faced her momentarily, and then drove away.

Mink told WTOP the two aggressively approached her, and one agent tried to grab her phone to stop her from recording and then he touched her face during the confrontation.

“I didn’t know they would be around the corner when I entered that parking lot. But I was not shocked to see them,” she said. “Two of them approached me from across the parking lot, yelling at me and pointing at me. … One of them grabbed me by the arm and pulled me and reached for my phone as well, which I pulled away.”

Mink told WTOP she was startled by what took place and did not identify herself as an elected official.

Mink said she has no intention of stopping what she’s doing and since ICE has stepped up its actions, she’s gone to areas where agents may be making arrests.

“The terrorizing of our communities is my business. It’s all of our business. We have the First Amendment right to film. And we’re not going anywhere,” she said in the same social media post after the incident. “I encourage everyone to be well versed on your rights and your neighbors’ rights, to consider all levers you may have to harden your workplace against efforts ICE may make to enter without a judicial warrant.”

Mink indicated that she’s weighing all possible legal courses of action.

“From my perspective, they were attempting to be threatening and intimidating, and it felt important to stand my ground,” she said. “They are untrained and did not know what to do. But it was very clear that they didn’t want me there, and they didn’t want me recording. … I am exploring all legal options at this point.”

WTOP has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on what took place.

,Litigation,2025-11-13 06:18:24+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,A decade-old Aurora ICE detention center lawsuit reaches the Supreme Court,"Molly Cruse, Caitlyn Kim, Colorado Public Radio Staff, Dan Boyce, Bente Birkeland",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/11/12/aurora-ice-detention-facility-lawsuit-scotus/,"A more-than-decade-old case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday against Aurora’s privately run immigration detention center.
The original lawsuit was filed by a former detainee of the ICE detention facility, Alejandro Menocal, in 2014.
""And then I would hand out brooms, mops, cleaning supplies to the detainees… Detainees cleaned out moldy showers, detainees cut hair, detainees cleaned the cells where we were housed, detainees did the outside maintenance in the yard.""
Menocal filed the original lawsuit, alongside eight other former detainees, against The GEO Group, Inc., the private prison company that runs the Aurora ICE detention center.
“We’re hopeful that the Court will reject GEO’s attempt to avoid accountability.” During oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of GEO’s defense.","A more-than-decade-old case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday against Aurora’s privately run immigration detention center. The original lawsuit was filed by a former detainee of the ICE detention facility, Alejandro Menocal, in 2014.

According to Menocal, who was held at the detention center for four months, he and other detainees were forced to do manual labor for $1 a day and were threatened with solitary confinement if they refused.

""Every day I would wake up at 5 a.m. to set up to serve meals,"" he told CPR News in an interview in 2014. ""And then I would hand out brooms, mops, cleaning supplies to the detainees… Detainees cleaned out moldy showers, detainees cut hair, detainees cleaned the cells where we were housed, detainees did the outside maintenance in the yard.""

Menocal filed the original lawsuit, alongside eight other former detainees, against The GEO Group, Inc., the private prison company that runs the Aurora ICE detention center.

But GEO — which is one of the nation’s largest private prison companies and has profited from the Trump administration’s immigration policies — argued it is immune from the lawsuit because it was acting as a federal contractor. However, lawyers for the detainees argued federal immunity does not extend to acts the federal government did not request or order. Meanwhile, the original suit has been delayed while the courts have taken up the question of immunity.

The company’s position relies on the centuries-old doctrine of “sovereign immunity,” which generally shields the federal government from certain lawsuits. In recent years, some contractors have sought to extend that protection to themselves.

Jennifer Dale Bennett, the attorney representing the detainees, disputed GEO’s claim. “GEO is asking the Supreme Court to grant private contractors the right to tie up lawsuits in endless, meritless appeals,” Bennett said in a statement to CPR News. “We’re hopeful that the Court will reject GEO’s attempt to avoid accountability.”

During oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of GEO’s defense.

“You’re just asking for a blanket no liability for contractors who are following the government’s instructions,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told an attorney representing the company.

That skepticism was echoed outside the courtroom. Andrew Schwartz, a law professor at University of Colorado Law School, said GEO faces a difficult legal path.

“GEO faces an uphill battle to convince the Supreme Court that their defense to this lawsuit is the sort of thing that must be immediately appealable and cannot wait until final judgment,” he said.

Schwartz added that the Supreme Court’s eventual decision could be influenced by Congress, noting that the justices’ ruling is “ultimately subject to congressional approval or disapproval.” If lawmakers believe federal contractors should be allowed to immediately appeal rulings that go against them, he said, Congress could pass a new statute to make that possible.

But for now, Schwartz noted, the Supreme Court case has effectively put the underlying lawsuit on hold.

US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU.
He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, Fleming told CNN.
Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.
“We aren’t leaving Chicago,” McLaughlin previously told CNN in a statement following reports Bovino planned to leave the city soon.","A federal judge ordered the release of more than 600 people arrested as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Illinois, according to CNN affiliate WLS, dealing a blow to federal efforts to detain and deport as many undocumented people as possible.

US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings on Wednesday morning sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Now, 615 of those arrested must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling, which applies to people who do not have mandatory detention orders and do not pose a significant threat.

“They’re all being awarded bond for 615, but how is that process going to happen?” said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, at a news conference Wednesday. He noted the people set to be released “are probably all over the country” and need to be located, Fleming told CNN.

Those detained were taken into custody by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, according to a Wednesday news release from the National Immigrant Justice Center.

Fleming, who led the lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a 2022 settlement agreement over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area, said the organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases.

In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.

“At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”

CNN has reached out to DHS for comment on whether it plans to appeal Cummings’ order. Meanwhile, government attorneys have requested a stay until next Friday, according to Fleming.

“All of this, all of the tactics of (senior Border Patrol official Gregory) Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said.

Bovino, 55, emerged as the on-the-ground face of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democratic-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.

The decision comes as tensions remain high over racial profiling and constitutional rights – for both documented and undocumented individuals – as the Trump administration’s broad mass deportation crackdown targets people of all ages, from children and families to suspected criminals, by making arrests outside courtroom hearings, during traffic stops and in workplace sweeps.

One of those recently arrested was Diana Galeano, a teacher at Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago. Video of her arrest, showing ICE officers running into the day care’s front doors and pulling her out, sparked outrage among parents and local leaders.

Her attorney, Charlie Wysong, applauded Judge Cummings’ ruling, saying it will help a lot of people.

“The detention of so many people with no lawful basis and little way to get a bond hearing without filing a lawsuit has been a great burden on so many families,” Wysong said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.

In a separate ruling Wednesday, US District Judge Jeremy C. Daniel granted a habeas petition filed by Galeano last week ruling her detention unlawful.

“The Court has recognized that Diana and scores of others like her should not be in custody indefinitely,” said Wysong in a statement regarding Daniel’s ruling. “This is an important step on Diana’s path to returning home where she belongs.”

ICE is expected to continue operations in Chicago. “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” McLaughlin previously told CNN in a statement following reports Bovino planned to leave the city soon. McLaughlin cited a drop in street crime since “Operation Midway Blitz” began.

News that Bovino could leave Chicago came shortly after he was personally called out by US District Court Judge Sara Ellis, who was angered Bovino initially claimed he had used tear gas on protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault occurred after his use of force.

“Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a preliminary injunction blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists.

At the Moshannon Valley Processing Center on Aug. 5, Ge was found dead in a shower stall with a cloth wrapped around his neck and with his legs and hands tied behind his back, according to the lawsuit.

Yangeng Ge, the detainee's brother, filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming federal officials unlawfully ignored his Freedom of Information Act request seeking answers about his brother's death.

ICE's Detainee Death Report for the inmate lists that he was brought to MVPC on July 31 after being convicted of accessing an electronic device issued to another who did not authorize use. It also lists the emergency procedures that officials took after finding Ge unresponsive.

David Rankin, a lawyer with New York-based law firm Beldock Levine & Hoffman, who is representing Ge's family on the case, refuted this information in an emailed statement. He said he understood Ge was held at the facility for ""a number of months.""

""We do not understand the information about how long he was at MVPC to be correct — which makes the whole report highly suspect,"" Rankin said via email. ""A chronology of what happened after they discovered him does not shed light on why it happened. ... Hopefully standing up and demanding transparency will encourage others to do the same. The more we can shed light on what happens at MVPC the better.""

ICE said it ""cannot comment on pending litigation.""

The lawsuit claims Ge felt isolated in MVPC because no one in the facility spoke Mandarin and the staff made no effort to communicate with him. Rankin said this allegation was corroborated by interviews with people who left the facility and medical records.

Yangeng Ge filed a FOIA request through his attorneys on Sept. 9 seeking information about his brother's detention including details about the conditions of the facility, his treatment by personnel and the circumstances of his death, the lawsuit said.

On Sept. 15, Yangeng Ge said he received confirmation from the U.S. Postal Service that ICE received the request, but he said it went ""unlawfully ignored"" because the agency was required to inform him whether hey would comply within 20 days of receipt.

""The government is so committed to keeping the public in the dark about what is happening at these detention centers that it is willing to violate the law,"" Jeremy Ravinsky, associate attorney at Beldock Levine & Hoffman, said in a statement. ""This lawsuit calls for much needed transparency into how the government is treating detainees.""

Yangeng Ge is seeking injunctive relief and for the agencies to release all records pertaining to his brother's detention and death.

They also called for clarity surrounding the potential ICE facility.
The 6 p.m. Newport city meeting will be livestreamed on the city's website and can be joined by Zoom.","Newport City Council will hold a special meeting on Nov. 12 to discuss information that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is considering a Newport location for a new immigration detention facility that could be operational by Dec. 1.

City officials said in a Nov. 10 news release that they were made aware that DHS is evaluating locations along the Oregon Coast for a potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility and had identified the Newport Municipal Airport as a possible location.

City leaders said they were working with local, state and federal legislators to verify the information, but had not been able to reach DHS representatives.

The release said the city's standard communication practices require confirmation of information before releasing it to the public, but due to the ""credibility"" and ""sensitivity"" of the issue, leaders decided to share the information.

“I am deeply concerned by recent reports suggesting that Newport may be under consideration for an ICE detention facility,"" Mayor Jan Kaplan said in the release. ""The well-being, safety, and values of our community are the highest priorities of myself and our City Council.""

At least 16 people were arrested by ICE Nov. 11 in Salem in the largest single-day operation the city has seen in years. The majority of people arrested by ICE in Oregon have been held at the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center or elsewhere in the U.S. The ICE facility on Portland’s south waterfront has a processing center, but is not a large-scale detention center.

State Rep. David Gomberg, D-Otis, said in a Nov. 12 news release that the sole U.S. Coast Guard helicopter at Newport was quietly relocated to a North Bend station on Oct. 30. The helicopter was a ""longstanding asset for search and rescue operations,"" he said.

Gomberg said ""mounting evidence"" indicates DHS intends to replace Coast Guard operations with a ""large-scale"" ICE detention center.

“Every day, we have been receiving more credible evidence that our federal government is pushing to site an immigration detainment facility in our community,” Gomberg said. “And disturbingly, we are receiving no communications or confirmation from the federal government as to what they are planning. They are operating in the shadows and trying to fast-track this project with zero transparency or public engagement.”

The city on Nov. 4 received a letter of intent from a federal contractor to lease a 4.3-acre airport property near the Coast Guard station to support ""operations of an unspecified federal project that they intend to be operational by December 1,"" Gomberg's release said.

A Lincoln County septic company received an inquiry from another federal contractor on Nov. 10 regarding costs for pumping up to 10,000 gallons of sewage per day for up to three years from tanks at the airport, the release said.

The federal contractor also listed hiring ads on Nov. 7 for a team that would be located at the airport. Another federal contractor also listed hiring ads for detention officers and transportation officers to ""provide care, custody, and control of those in ICE custody,"" the release said.

""I am calling on DHS and the Trump Administration to explain themselves to our community,"" Gomberg said. ""If you want to turn our community into the West Coast epicenter of your immigration plans by December 1, then at the very least, you need to explain your plan and communicate with the people who you were sworn to serve. This isn’t how good or honest government operates, and we aren’t going to tolerate it.”

U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and U.S. Reps. Suzanne Bonamici and Val Hoyle, all Oregon Democrats, wrote a letter Nov. 12 to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, urging her to provide a clear explanation of DHS's actions and intentions in Newport.

The Oregon lawmakers said the Coast Guard serves the city and central Oregon Coast as a ""critical lifeline for Oregon's fishing industry, coastal visitors, and residents of Newport.""

""This move endangers all those at sea, and will certainly undermine search and rescue operations, particularly ahead of crabbing season,"" the letter said.

They also called for clarity surrounding the potential ICE facility.

""ICE has already rounded up law-abiding members of our communities who present no threat to public safety, which has created fear among Oregon families,” they wrote in the letter. “Newport residents and small business owners remain extremely concerned about the social and economic consequences that will result from ICE enhancing its presence in the town and the surrounding areas.”

The lawmakers demanded Noem provide a written response by Nov. 14 addressing if DHS was involved in the reassignment of the Coast Guard, if DHS or ICE have been taking steps to establish a detention facility in Newport, and why DHS has not consulted with Oregon officials before making such changes.

By then, Chicago’s gang data was already notorious for being riddled with contradictions and error.
Some were labeled by police as gang members but not linked to any particular group.
Prosecutors and police relied on the designations of alleged gang members in their filings and investigations.
Spencer Reynolds, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center, says the episode illustrates how federal intelligence officers can sidestep local sanctuary laws.","On November 21, 2023, field intelligence officers within the Department of Homeland Security quietly deleted a trove of Chicago Police Department records. It was not a routine purge.

For seven months, the data—records that had been requested on roughly 900 Chicagoland residents—sat on a federal server in violation of a deletion order issued by an intelligence oversight body. A later inquiry found that nearly 800 files had been kept, which a subsequent report said breached rules designed to prevent domestic intelligence operations from targeting legal US residents. The records originated in a private exchange between DHS analysts and Chicago police, a test of how local intelligence might feed federal government watchlists. The idea was to see whether street-level data could surface undocumented gang members in airport queues and at border crossings. The experiment collapsed amid what government reports describe as a chain of mismanagement and oversight failures.

Internal memos reviewed by WIRED reveal that the dataset was first requested by a field officer in the DHS’s Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) in the summer of 2021. By then, Chicago’s gang data was already notorious for being riddled with contradictions and error. City inspectors had warned that police couldn’t vouch for its accuracy. Entries created by police included people purportedly born before 1901 and others who appeared to be infants. Some were labeled by police as gang members but not linked to any particular group.

Police baked their own contempt into the data, listing people’s occupations as “SCUM BAG,” “TURD,” or simply “BLACK.” Neither arrest nor conviction was necessary to make the list.

Prosecutors and police relied on the designations of alleged gang members in their filings and investigations. They shadowed defendants through bail hearings and into sentencing. For immigrants, it carried extra weight. Chicago’s sanctuary rules barred most data sharing with immigration officers, but a carve-out at the time for “known gang members” left open a back door. Over the course of a decade, immigration officers tapped into the database more than 32,000 times, records show.

The I&A memos—first obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU through a public records request—show that what began inside DHS as a limited data-sharing experiment seems to have soon unraveled into a cascade of procedural lapses. The request for the Chicagoland data moved through layers of review with no clear owner, its legal safeguards overlooked or ignored. By the time the data landed on I&A’s server around April 2022, the field officer who had initiated the transfer had left their post. The experiment ultimately collapsed under its own paperwork. Signatures went missing, audits were never filed, and the deletion deadline slipped by unnoticed. The guardrails meant to keep intelligence work pointed outward—toward foreign threats, not Americans—simply failed.

Faced with the lapse, I&A ultimately killed the project in November 2023, wiping the dataset and memorializing the breach in a formal report.

Spencer Reynolds, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center, says the episode illustrates how federal intelligence officers can sidestep local sanctuary laws. “This intelligence office is a workaround to so-called sanctuary protections that limit cities like Chicago from direct cooperation with ICE,” he says. “Federal intelligence officers can access the data, package it up, and then hand it off to immigration enforcement, evading important policies to protect residents.”

Records trace the incident back more than four years, but the ambitions behind it haven’t faded. DHS’s budget will soon exceed $191 billion, and its leaders are pursuing technologies to fuse sensitive data across agency systems once kept deliberately apart. A March 2025 executive order encouraged federal departments to “eliminate information silos across the government,” while DHS’s own AI initiatives promise to merge public and commercial data into tools for enforcement and surveillance. Those ambitions ride on a federal watch-listing apparatus that screens travelers at airports, borders, and visa desks.

An integral part of that apparatus is the Terrorist Screening Dataset, the FBI’s own consolidated watch list. Alongside it, the bureau’s Threat Screening Center runs the Transnational Organized Crime Actor Detection Program, or TADP—a companion list aimed at flagging cartel and gang actors at border checks and police encounters. Its charter draws a clear line: No US citizens or lawful permanent residents are to be included. I&A’s guidelines allow for temporary retention of such data, but only to determine its foreign intelligence value.

Reynolds warns that the scope of those watch-listing activities has grown. “Thanks to how the government characterizes people with some connection to a cartel as ‘terrorists,’ it could impact the lives of millions more people in this country,” he says. “This can potentially justify federal targeting of family members, churches, food banks, and others who support immigrants.”

The lapses at I&A began with a June 2021 FBI decision to expand the TADP to include the Latin Kings, a Chicago-born street gang with regional factions. The group’s name appears redacted in the documents reviewed by WIRED, except on a single page. The TADP list itself isn’t classified, but remains restricted from public view. The inclusion of the Latin Kings has not been previously reported.

Spurred by the FBI decision, an I&A field officer contacted two Chicago PD officials the next month, requesting a bulk extract of the city’s gang records. The goal, they said, was to “fully exploit the list.” Because bulk transfers automatically trigger internal privacy reviews, the pull went to DHS’s Data Access Review Council (DARC), an oversight body that handles sensitive requests. More than six months went by as it considered the field officer’s plan to ingest the Chicagoland data.

In January 2022, before the paperwork closed, the officer who launched the project left office. In what was later described as a “serious staffing gap,” their replacement would not arrive for eight months. Even so, the DARC team finalized a set of terms and conditions: Delete all US-person data in the gang dataset within a year and file a six-month report so leadership could track its use. Neither requirement was met.

According to I&A’s own terms, the Chicago PD extract included names, addresses, birth dates, and alleged gang affiliations and factions, along with sex and race.

“What is striking about the factual record during the spring of 2022,” an I&A oversight officer later wrote, “is the complete lack of awareness on the part of any I&A senior leader that the terms and conditions were even under consideration.” On April 18, 2022, the agreement was signed not by the undersecretary for intelligence and analysis, or a designated surrogate, as policy required, but by the office’s chief information officer. Investigators later reported the reasons for this “are unclear.”

In the background, Chicago’s own audit trail was public and unambiguous. City inspectors issued a report years prior that described not one “gang database,” but at least 18 forms and locations where the Chicago’s gang data lived. Police could not “definitively account for all such information in its possession and control,” the report says. More than 500 outside agencies had queried those systems over a million times in a decade. The report documented the same failures repeated throughout: impossible ages, blank identifiers, even slurs. Chicago PD’s lack of data controls served as an example, inspectors said, of how such dossiers might be used to “demean and dehumanize members of the public.”

The report found there was effectively no process for notice or appeal and no routine purge of records for people who had left gangs or gone years without a police encounter. Ninety-five percent of those labeled were Black or Latino.

Chicago’s systems spread the labels widely. Inside the department’s data network, known as CLEAR, officers could map gang factions and territory using a tool called Caboodle; chart associations between suspect gang members using a tool called Link Analysis; and pull up arrest histories through its Gang Members Search portal. The Chicago public school system alone was associated with 87,302 gang‑related queries over 10 years—more than all immigration agencies combined—illustrating how far the information traveled.

In response to public pressure, Chicago police proposed a new system with published criteria, an appeals process, and a five-year removal rule for anyone without new qualifying offenses. It promised audits, officer training, and limits on data sharing. Whether those changes materialized as promised—and how the department handled legacy flags—became the fight that followed.

Four months before I&A’s request, the city’s inspector general found that Chicago PD had made “minimal progress” towards reform. Two years in, the department still had no timetable, no uniform policy, and continued to rely on old data. In the meantime, it broadened the criteria for adding people into the system—but never disclosed the change, leaving outdated policies online. The watchdog concluded that the department had fallen “critically short” of meeting the commitments it made after its 2019 review.

Chicago PD did not respond to questions about the project or its current use of gang data.

At I&A, its window for evaluating the data closed in April 2023. (Officials had an opportunity to request an extension that March, but failed to do so.) Months passed before oversight staff noticed. A preliminary inquiry found that I&A retained at least 797 “documents” in violation of its own rules prohibiting the collection or retention of domestic intelligence. On paper, the plan had been narrow—review local police intelligence with a focus on noncitizens and delete the rest on schedule. The records describe what followed as a total compliance failure.

In August 2023, a Chicago city commission voted to reject the police department’s proposed replacement database. Three months later—and just two weeks after the database was formally scrapped by the city—I&A deleted the Chicago dataset. In February 2024, DHS’s then undersecretary for I&A, Kenneth Wainstein, approved mitigation measures requiring staff training and other procedures to ensure bulk transfers don’t proceed without his office’s sign-off.

DHS declined to discuss the incident or detail what corrective steps were ultimately taken. A spokesperson says the agency “abides by strict standards for data keeping and record maintenance” and that “all records are handled in accordance with existing law and regulation.”

Congressional auditors reached a different conclusion this summer. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in July that I&A still lacks basic controls needed to track how intelligence is collected and used. The office produced its first consolidated intelligence budget in 2025—12 years after that became a legal requirement. Meanwhile, WIRED reported in September that a misconfiguration in the Homeland Security Information Network’s intelligence portal left hundreds of I&A reports open to thousands of unauthorized users.

“Robust oversight has long taken a back seat at the department,” says Reynolds adds, pointing to the recent gutting of DHS’s civil rights and civil liberties office. “Would an oversight inquiry like this even happen now? Probably not.”

Analysts from multiple DHS offices told congressional auditors that finished intelligence reports continue to circulate without proper review and are sometimes published with factual errors. At the time of the audit, the agency’s own internal list of offices conducting intelligence work hadn’t been updated in nine years, all but ensuring fragmented policy and compliance.

As in previous reviews, DHS pledged new procedures and set deadlines stretching into the new year.

While Chicago’s gang database is gone, Illinois maintains its own. State police continue to operate a statewide gang file through what’s called the Law Enforcement Agencies Data System, or LEADS. State records show DHS’s Enforcement and Removal Operations directorate signed a new LEADS data-sharing agreement last year. Chicago police did not respond to questions about what role they play, if any, in the statewide system.","https://media.wired.com/photos/690cd0292018c1e811eadd25/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/DHS-Failed-to-Delete-Sensitive-Data-on-Americans-Politics-2221926006.jpg",N,,2025-11-12 21:57:32.939612

In the video shared with News4 by Mink, federal agents and their vehicles can be seen. Seconds into the clip, two of the agents are seen confronting Mink, who was recording with her phone.

“Didn't I tell you about that? Get away. Stay where you are,” an agent can be heard saying to Mink.

“Don't touch me,” Mink responded.

“You need to go,” the agent said.

The encounter happened behind a shopping center where Tick Tock liquors used to be on University Boulevard in the Adelphi area of Prince George's County.

Mink says she was driving in the area just before 7:30 a.m. Monday looking for ICE activity

“I circled back there, and it took me a moment to realize that I was witnessing a likely ICE arrest, and so that’s when I stepped out and began filming,” she told News4.

It's unclear what happened before Mink started recording, but the councilwoman says she was confronted by two masked agents. One had ""Homeland Security"" on his vest.

“Mind your own business,” one agent said in the video.

“You gotta go,” the other said.

Mink says it's part of her responsibility as an elected leader to document immigration enforcement activity, which she has done before, but she says this time was different.

“Don't touch me, don't grab my phone,” Mink can be heard saying.

“Go over there,” one of the agents said.

“He grabbed my arm and he kind of pulled me and then he reached for my phone, but I don't believe he made contact with the phone,” she said. “I yanked my hand back.”

Residents and elected leaders have expressed concerns about immigration enforcement activity in Prince George's County, which is part of the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.

Back in September, News4 reported on a viral video of an ICE arrest where a federal agent lost control of his gun then appeared to point it toward bystanders.

Mink says on Monday, someone was detained and put in an unmarked vehicle right as she started recording and was driven away.

“These activities make our community less safe,” she said. “They are terrorizing our neighborhoods, so it's distressing to see it.”

Mink didn't file a complaint but says she's considering all legal options. Mink says it's important to document because at times, someone can disappear and their family has no idea where they are.

“We've had instances where they didn't find out where a loved one was until they were about to be put on a plane to another country,” she said, “there's no way to mobilize any kind of legal support, so I was glad that I had gotten there just in time to see what happened.”

News4 reached out to ICE and Homeland Security but has not yet heard back.

In a statement, Prince George’s County Councilmember Wanika Fisher, who represents the area where Mink was filming, said, “I am deeply concerned by Councilmember Kristin Mink’s troubling encounter with ICE agents while documenting an immigration arrest. No public official—or resident—should face intimidation for exercising their rights. Our community deserves clear standards for ICE conduct and real accountability for misconduct. I stand with Councilmember Mink and all residents in demanding respect and safety from every law enforcement agency.”",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/11/Montgomery-County-Council-member-captures-ICE-detainment-in-Prince-Georges.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-13 03:57:41.259654

It’s not clear how many of the 615 people covered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings’ order remain in the country. And the judge said he doesn’t want anyone released who poses a risk to public safety. He’s giving the Justice Department a chance to identify any such person.

But Cummings ultimately said he’s trying to restore the status quo that existed before the Trump administration recently changed its interpretation of immigration law. That policy shift subjected people across the country to mandatory detention who previously would have been given a chance at a bond hearing.

Immigration advocates have said that law only applies to “noncitizens who recently arrived at a border or port of entry,” not to people who have lived in the country for an extended period of time. And more than 100 judges across the country have apparently agreed with them.

But, Cummings noted in a hearing last month, “I do not think the government has appealed,” meaning no higher court has had a chance to weigh in.

The 600 or so detainees come from a list of roughly 1,800 arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Chicago area between June 11 and Oct. 7. Only about 750 of them remain in the country, and about 135 had final orders of removal or criminal convictions, according to Mark Fleming, a lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

More people could be released upon a review of all people arrested by ICE and Customs and Border Protection between June and November.

Among those detained under the Trump administration’s reading of the law was Ruben Torres Maldonado. His detention last month disrupted his 16-year-old daughter’s cancer treatment, and U.S. District Judge Jeremy Daniel later ordered that he be given a bond hearing.

“There is no dispute here that [Maldonado], a noncitizen, was ‘already in the country,’” Daniel wrote in an order. “He has been here for more than two decades.”

An immigration judge later ordered Maldonado’s release.

Justice Department attorneys have not appealed in Maldonado’s case. Maldonado went on to testify at a separate hearing about unsanitary conditions inside the ICE facility in Broadview, where he’d been held.

Now Cummings has entered this new ruling, in the case involving the so-called Castanon Nava settlement agreement. It restricts the ability of ICE agents, and anyone working with them, to make warrantless arrests in Illinois and nearby states.

Cummings last month extended the agreement into February.

The judge said Wednesday that staff attorneys at the courthouse reviewed a mountain of petitions recently filed at the courthouse from people challenging the Trump administration’s reading of the immigration law.

Cummings said that 54 of those people were arrested at work, including 20 landscapers and four ride-share or taxi drivers. Twenty were arrested commuting to or from work, he added, and nine were arrested at a Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or to pick up supplies.”

Seven were also arrested at an “immigration-related hearing,” Cummings said, while 11 were arrested in public places like a park, gas station or even a Dunkin’ Donuts drive-thru.

“It seems highly likely to me that at least some of those individuals are among the 615 detainees who are not subject to mandatory detention,” Cummings said. He also found them unlikely to be members of gangs, “assorted other ne’er-do-wells” or the “worst of the worst.”

Justice Department lawyers asked Cummings to delay his order, and he agreed not to require the release until Nov. 21. The feds’ request for a stay could also signal that an appeal is on the way.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c1c169/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcf%2F52%2Ffeea9d164bf4b0491fc96f439391%2Flakeviewice-102525-17.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 20:58:17.617593

In Florida, agents patrol land and coast borders and arrest people who are unlawfully in the United States.
Under the Trump administration, Border Patrol encounters with immigrants between ports of entry in the U.S.-Mexican border have plummeted, according to government data.
Border agents in the Miami sector carried out 6,470 apprehensions between October 2024 and September 2025.","There will soon be more Border Patrol agents roaming South Florida to enforce border security and immigration law, thanks to the Trump administration’s billion-dollar injection of federal funds.

In an interview with the Miami Herald, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael W. Banks said the agency will permanently station more agents across the Miami sector, which is headquartered in South Florida and also operates out of Georgia and the Carolinas. That will represent a 110% increase in officials throughout the area of responsibility, the chief said, although he did not specify how many agents are currently stationed there. An agency spokesman would not specify exact numbers for the increase, citing security reasons.

“The most important thing for us in Border Security is to be able to see a threat before it ever gets to our Coast or gets to our land border,” Banks said. Banks is a veteran Border Patrol officer whom President Donald Trump appointed to head the agency in January.

Border Patrol, under the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with preventing terrorists from entering the country. It’s also focused on stopping the flow of illicit arms, undocumented immigrants and drug trafficking between U.S. ports of entry. In Florida, agents patrol land and coast borders and arrest people who are unlawfully in the United States.

The top immigration official also said there will be investments for facility improvements, civilian personnel hiring, and technology like drones that consistently watch over the borders. The cash is coming from a law known as the Big Beautiful Bill, which is providing $165 billion for Homeland Security. Nationwide, that will fund the hiring of 3,000 new Border Patrol agents and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officials, as well as 80,000 additional beds in detention facilities.

Trump and his top immigration officials have argued that the massive infusion of capital into Homeland Security is necessary to fulfill the administration’s mass deportation goals. Under the Trump administration, Border Patrol encounters with immigrants between ports of entry in the U.S.-Mexican border have plummeted, according to government data. But there’s been an uptick in immigration encounters in South Florida. Border agents in the Miami sector carried out 6,470 apprehensions between October 2024 and September 2025. That’s up from the three previous fiscal years, although there were notably 5,741 apprehensions in fiscal year 2022.

Banks credits the uptick in activity in South Florida to the nose dive in encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We’ve been able to return Florida agents back to Florida because they are not somewhere else helping process massive amounts of illegal immigrants. And where you have more law enforcement, you have more enforcement. You’re going to see those apprehension numbers continue to rise,” he said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials have also established collaborations to assist federal authorities, who are constitutionally tasked with immigration enforcement. The Sunshine State has the largest number of agreements under Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which grants trained officers limited immigration duties. That includes the power to arrest people suspected of violating U.S. immigration law. Activists have condemned its widespread implementation in Florida, arguing it makes communities less safe because immigrants will be discouraged from reporting crimes. They also point to a 2011 investigation from the Department of Justice that found cops under the 287(g) program in Arizona violated civil rights of immigrants and racially profiled Latinos.

Banks and other law enforcement officials have said that it only makes sense to work together with state agencies on immigration. He called cooperation with the state “extremely helpful.” During an ICE-led operation known as “Tidal Wave,” federal and state authorities arrested over 1,000 people in Florida in a single week. That includes 378 people with deportation orders and several gang members, ICE said. Border Patrol assisted in the operation.

“If you arrest someone and then you turn around and just release that person on the streets, now a new arrest has to happen. And every new arrest has a potential for danger. So it makes the streets much safer if we work together and communicate with each other,” Banks said. He added that undocumented immigrants without rap sheets sometimes get picked up during operations targeting criminals. “We can’t unsee or unlearn that someone’s in the country.”

Banks briefly retired from Border Patrol in 2023 over policy disagreements with the Biden administration, and during that time advised Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on border security as the first-ever “border czar” in that state. Since he returned in January, Border Patrol has also had boots on the ground during high profile, ICE-led operations in Los Angeles and Chicago. So far, ICE has not asked the agency for assistance in an operation of that nature for Florida, Banks said, and the agency has no knowledge of any upcoming plans.

Federal authorities have been slammed with lawsuits and multiple accusations of excessive use of force, civil rights violations, and racial profiling In Los Angeles and Chicago. Banks said the accusations his team has investigated have not been credible, though he didn’t specify which cases. He also pointed to an uptick in attacks against law enforcement.

“My agents are some of the most professional law enforcement officers out there. We’re well-trained, we don’t racial profile, and focus on those that are in the country, illegally,” he said. “If we find an agent has behaved inappropriately we will take the appropriate action.”

As a teenager growing up in Georgia, Banks picked peaches with immigrant workers. Like him, they were trying to get by and support their families. Those experiences have shaped his approach to law enforcement. When asked about his agency’s responsibility to the people in their custody, the Border Patrol chief said: humane enforcement of the law.

“Just because someone is being arrested doesn’t mean that they need to be mistreated. And we’re not going to do that. We’re going to treat them with the respect they deserve as human beings.”

What’s an ICE detainer?
Police officers trained under the 287(g) program can issue ICE detainers based on the information they’ve gathered or at the written request of federal officials.","A day before Arizona native Leticia Jacobo was scheduled to be released from an Iowa jail, her mom visited to verify pickup details with the staff. Ericka Burns was excited to drive her daughter home after spending a month apart and wanted to make sure Jacobo wasn’t forced to wait a minute longer than necessary.

But jail staff told Burns that Jacobo wouldn’t be let go because she would be turned over to immigration agents — even though Jacobo is Native American.

The 24-year-old was born in Phoenix and is a member of Arizona’s Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. She was booked into the Polk County Jail in Des Moines, Iowa, where she currently lives, in September for allegedly driving with a suspended license. Jacobo was scheduled to be released on Nov. 11, but what should have been a routine process was complicated and delayed by an erroneously issued ICE detainer. She was ultimately allowed to leave just before 4:30 a.m. on Nov. 12.

Maria Nunez, Burns’ sister, said that it was terrifying to be told that Jacobo would be taken by federal agents, especially because no one appeared willing to correct the mistake at first.

“My sister said, ‘How is she going to get deported if she’s a Native American?’ and ‘We have proof,’” Nunez recounted. “They said, ‘Well, we don’t know because we’re not immigration and we can’t answer those questions. We’re just holding her for them. So, when they pick her up tonight they’re going to go ahead and deport her to wherever they’re going to take her, but we have no information on that.’”

Jacobo’s family quickly mobilized, with just hours left on the clock before jail staff said she would be transferred into federal custody. The Veteran’s Day holiday resulted in several communication dead ends. Desperate for some kind of help, Jacobo’s aunts, both in Arizona and Nebraska, put out calls for help via Facebook and connected with local tribal leaders. Ericka took a copy of Jacobo’s birth certificate to the jail and stayed on site to make sure ICE didn’t take her daughter.

Lt. Mark Chance, a spokesman for the Polk County Sheriff’s Office, which oversees the jail, said that the ICE detainer against Jacobo was the result of a clerical mix-up and was intended for a different person who was booked in the jail at the same time. ICE agents requested a detainer be placed on that person, but a mistake resulted in it being put on Jacobo’s file, instead. Chance said that “internal” discussions would likely be had about how to prevent similar problems in the future.

“It was human error, but I’m sure as soon as the command staff find out about it, they’re going to have some meetings with their supervisors internally and be like, ‘Hey, guys, we gotta keep our thumb on this, this is silly,’” Chance said.

What’s an ICE detainer?

Polk County Jail has a 287(g) agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That partnership authorizes local law enforcement officials to perform some immigration enforcement functions, including preparing removal paperwork, interrogating people who have been arrested about their citizenship status and comparing their biographic information against U.S. Department of Homeland Security databases to identify people who may be eligible for deportation. The purpose of the program is to cut down on the investigative legwork for ICE and increase deportations.

Police officers trained under the 287(g) program can issue ICE detainers based on the information they’ve gathered or at the written request of federal officials. Detainers allow a person in custody to be held for an extra 48 hours after their scheduled release time, even if they have not yet been convicted of a crime, to give ICE agents time to take them into custody.

Because detainer requests don’t require probable cause and aren’t mandatory in the same way that judicial orders are, some law enforcement agencies choose to ignore them, wary of the legal consequences. The courts have ruled that detainers are potentially unconstitutional because they result in prolonged imprisonment, and multiple lawsuits have been filed after detainers were issued against U.S. citizens.

The use of detainers has come under new scrutiny amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which has seen a massive spike in their issuance. Within the first two months of Trump taking office, the rate of detainers issued on a daily basis jumped by 72% compared with the first two months of Biden’s presidency.

Mistake or discrimination?

Jacobo’s ordeal highlights the fallout of aggressive immigration enforcement for Native Americans. In January, Navajo Nation officials reported more than a dozen Indigenous people in Arizona and New Mexico had been questioned or detained by federal immigration authorities.

Nunez told the Arizona Mirror she was skeptical that the mix-up was nothing more than a misunderstanding, and that discrimination wasn’t involved at least to some degree. She noted that Jacobo had her tribal identification with her, had been fingerprinted, had her Social Security number on file and has been booked into the same jail more than once.

“I do want to say that it’s racial profiling because she’s been there before, they have a rap sheet on her — why would they make a mistake with someone that’s constantly coming in?” Nunez asked.

She added that her sister is considering further legal action and said that she’s concerned about the potential for future harm. Not everyone has a family as involved in their welfare as Jacobo does, she pointed out. Jacobo herself wasn’t informed about the detainer against her, despite it being placed on her file a week earlier, on Nov. 4.

The ICE field office for the midwest region did not answer questions about whether they verify existing detainers for accuracy or what their processes are for ensuring Native Americans aren’t being detained.

“I’m just so happy that we caught it and we know what’s going on and she’s not alone in this,” Nunez said, before Jacobo was released. “I just hope it doesn’t ever happen to someone else, with them not knowing they’re going to get deported.”",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/leticia-jacobo-bg.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 21:57:43.946152

The Turkish government should stop deporting Uyghurs to third countries and recognize them as refugees. Other governments should halt transferring Uyghurs to Türkiye and consider resettling Uyghur refugees from Türkiye.

(Istanbul) – Turkish authorities are increasingly restricting the legal residency of Uyghurs seeking safety from the Chinese government, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 51-page report, “Protected No More: Uyghurs in Türkiye,” finds that Uyghurs’ previous access to international protection status, and indeed preferential treatment under the Turkish immigration system, is being nullified as authorities arbitrarily mark their police and immigration records with “restriction codes,” denoting them a “public security threat.” The government detains some Uyghurs in inhumane and degrading conditions, and coerces them to sign voluntary return forms, putting them at risk of removal to third countries that have extradition agreements with China.

“Until recently, Uyghurs who escaped repression at home felt safe in Türkiye, but as China-Türkiye relations warm, and the Erdoğan government cracks down on refugees and migrants, many are growing fearful,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Some Uyghurs say they don’t dare leave their homes for fear of arrests and being sent to deportation centers, while others are undertaking perilous journeys elsewhere in search of safety.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 Uyghurs, 6 lawyers, and a Turkish government official knowledgeable about the situation, and reviewed Turkish government policies and documents, such as deportation decisions, case records, and circular orders. Human Rights Watch also reviewed publicly available cases of 33 Uyghurs who were held in deportation centers between December 2018 and October 2025.

“Now, because I don’t have any legal documents, I cannot even go outside because of fear, even for groceries because I don't want to end up in the deportation center again.” said a Uyghur whose residence permit was arbitrarily canceled by Turkish authorities.

Under the immigration crackdown, Uyghurs, like other refugees and migrants in Türkiye, are often assigned “restriction codes” (typically code “G87”) that can lead to a cascade of negative and often devastating consequences. These include rejection of international protection applications or another status entitling an individual to residency, as well as denial of citizenship. Uyghurs have effectively become “irregular migrants” and some eventually are ordered deported. When they interact with a police or immigration officers for any reason, they can be sent to a deportation center.

The Uyghurs and their lawyers that were interviewed said that Uyghurs are subjected to ill-treatment in detention centers and often pressured to sign voluntary return forms, allowing them to be repatriated or sent to another country. At least three of the Uyghurs interviewed had signed the form, and one of them was deported to the United Arab Emirates, which has an extradition treaty with China.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Migration Management President seeking comments on the report findings and information about Uyghurs in Türkiye on September 23, and again on October 27, 2025, and received no answer.

The assignment of restriction codes is linked to the implementation of Türkiye’s Law 6458 on Foreigners and International Protection. How and why restriction codes are assigned is unclear and in practice their use seems to reach far beyond what was intended under the law. They are often imposed without reasonable justification, concrete evidence, or a clear causal link to wrongdoing.

Under Turkish law, individuals can appeal deportation decisions.Human Rights Watch reviewed five court decisions from 2024 and 2025 concerning deportation order appeals by Uyghurs. In each case, the court upheld the deportation order without saying what the individuals had done that constituted the alleged threat to public security and order. Worryingly, in each case the court ruled that the prohibition of refoulement did not apply, contending that the applicant Uyghur had not established they would be at risk of ill-treatment and torture if sent to China. A lawyer who has lodged many such appeals said that judges can often issue “a negative decision [dismissing an appeal] when they see restriction codes, just to be safe.”

The Turkish government is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture or other serious ill-treatment, a threat to life, or other comparable serious human rights violations.

A simple complaint from a neighbor or being ensnared in a criminal case—even though later acquitted—can result in decisions to apply the restriction codes. Turkish authorities also base these codes on intelligence provided by other governments. In some cases, the Chinese government submitted lists of people it brands as “terrorists,” a term it conflates with peaceful activism or expression of Uyghur identity in Xinjiang.

Since 2017, the Chinese government has subjected Uyghurs to severe human rights abuses that Human Rights Watch and independent legal experts have concluded amount to crimes against humanity. If returned to China, especially from a country such as Türkiye that the Chinese government deems “sensitive,” Uyghurs may face detention, interrogation, torture, and other cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment.

“The Turkish government should respect the principle of nonrefoulement, immediately stop all deportations of Uyghurs to third countries, and recognize Uyghurs as refugees on a prima facie basis,” Pearson said. “Other governments should halt transferring Uyghurs to Türkiye, as it can no longer be considered a safe third country for Uyghurs, and should consider resettling Uyghur refugees from Türkiye.”

Selected Quotes:

“I was treated as if I was guilty. I spent one year in detention.... I tried several times to renew my residence permit but failed. The immigration office told me I had 10 days to leave the country, after telling me that my latest residence permit application was rejected. Then, I decided to leave the country. I had my Chinese passport, so I booked a flight to a third country that would be a path for me to go to safety in Europe. Turkish authorities detained me at the airport and put me on a two-year entry ban.”

- A Uyghur who was arbitrarily detained by Turkish authorities because of a restriction code and left Türkiye afterwards, June 2025.

“The conditions were very poor. In one instance, the facility did not provide proper food for nine days straight. In one deportation center, I slept on the cement floor for a week where I shared a single blanket with two other people. There were 20 people in a small cell where there was no sense of hygiene. I witnessed people who got infested with lice.”

- A Uyghur who spent several months at various deportation centers, May 2025.

“In some instances, people who had a call with someone suspicious can get assigned a code. For example, there was a Uyghur who was detained on suspicion of “terrorism” but then released unconditionally, as there was a lack of evidence.

“We’re concerned they have no access to counsel and no understanding of what their situation is,” Fleming told the judge.
During Wednesday’s hearing, Cummings listed instances since the crackdown started in which immigration agents have arrested people while they were at work, out walking or pulling through the drive-thru lane at a fast-food restaurant.
But leaders in Illinois say violent crime had already been trending downward in the Chicago area and that federal agents only inflamed tensions.
The consent decree, which expired earlier this year, was extended until February.","CHICAGO — Hundreds of people who have been arrested and detained in the Chicago area during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown could soon be released on bond while they await immigration hearings, a federal judge signaled Wednesday.

During a hearing in Chicago, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings said he would order the full release of 13 detained individuals based on a 2022 consent decree outlining how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can make so-called warrantless arrests.

He also gave government attorneys a Friday deadline to comb through a list of 615 people detained at county jails and federal facilities nationwide to see if they qualify for alternatives to detention under the decree, such as using an ankle monitor, while their immigration cases proceed. The judge said he’d issue an order for their release next week, and in the meantime would temporarily pause any deportation proceedings for people who might qualify for bond under the decree.

Attorneys for the detainees hailed Cummings’ move as a win and said they plan to bring more cases.

“All of the tactics of ICE have been unlawful in the vast majority of arrests,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer with the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center.

Attorneys said they were racing against the clock, as many of the more than 3,300 people suspected of immigration violations who have been arrested in Chicago and its suburbs since “Operation Midway Blitz” began in September have already been deported or left of their own accord.

“We’re concerned they have no access to counsel and no understanding of what their situation is,” Fleming told the judge.

Will Weiland, a Justice Department attorney, told Cummings that at least 12 people on the list of 615 were “high risk” and shouldn’t be released into communities.

“Nothing has been easy with this case your honor,” he said.

Cummings previously determined that ICE had violated the consent decree which, among other things, requires the agency to show documentation for each arrest it makes for people besides those being specifically targeted in an operation.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Cummings listed instances since the crackdown started in which immigration agents have arrested people while they were at work, out walking or pulling through the drive-thru lane at a fast-food restaurant.

“It also seems highly unlikely to me that any of these foreign nationals … fall into the category of what ICE has called the ‘worst of the worst,’” he said.

The Trump administration has touted its federal intervention efforts as effective at fighting crime and applauded agents’ aggressive tactics that have been challenged in court. But leaders in Illinois say violent crime had already been trending downward in the Chicago area and that federal agents only inflamed tensions.

While the consent decree covers arrests by ICE, it doesn’t include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has been behind the most controversial tactics used during the immigration operation, including the liberal use of chemical agents.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, hasn’t offered details about its arrests, only highlighting a handful of people living in the country without legal permission who also had criminal histories. DHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Wednesday’s hearing.

The consent decree, which expired earlier this year, was extended until February. Although its policy on ICE’s warrantless arrests applies nationwide, remedies for individual cases have been focused in six states covered by the ICE field office in Chicago, where the original lawsuit over immigration sweeps was filed. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Wisconsin.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251112-Broadview-illinois-protest-ew-540p-95c179.jpg",N,,2025-11-12 21:57:47.407245

U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.) released the following reaction to the report:

“The findings in this report are horrific, and they are doubly disturbing because the United States is directly implicated. It would not be an exaggeration to describe what is happening daily in CECOT as President Bukele’s Abu Ghraib.

“What happened to those 40 men is shocking, but it was not unique to them. The abuses and deprivations they describe are endemic inside the walls of CECOT. These men were forcibly disappeared, which is a crime in this country and a violation of international law. From their first day behind CECOT’s walls, each of them was subjected to near-daily beatings, food and medical deprivation, and other inhumane and appallingly degrading treatment.

“Nobody defends the heinous crimes and corruption perpetrated by Tren de Aragua and other violent criminal organizations. They have terrorized the people of Venezuela, El Salvador, and many other countries. Those who commit such atrocities should be brought to justice. President Bukele’s Kafkaesque response to these criminal gangs is a prison that the guards describe as ‘hell’ and where everyone, innocent or guilty, is labeled a terrorist. Criminal proceedings, if one can call them that, are conducted en masse and make a mockery of due process.

“President Trump has feted Bukele in Washington and praised his leadership. Bukele has called himself the world’s “coolest dictator”. There is one thing President Bukele should remember: President Trump’s term expires on January 20, 2028, after which he will no longer be there to turn a blind eye to Bukele’s role in presiding over the torture and denial of fundamental rights of tens of thousands of prisoners, many of whom have no affiliation with violent gangs. Sooner or later the law will catch up to President Bukele, and there will be accountability for what is happening in CECOT.

“Until then, or for as long as torture continues in El Salvador’s prisons, the Trump Administration must stop deportations to El Salvador. It is immoral for the United States to be paying Bukele to lock up deportees knowing they will be brutalized and denied due process.”

The 81-page report contains detailed, first-hand accounts of 40 Venezuelan prisoners in CECOT who were deported by the Department of Homeland Security and then returned to Venezuela in exchange for 10 American citizens or permanent residents who had been detained by President Maduro. Report investigators found no evidence that any of the Venezuelans in their report were members of the notorious Tren de Aragua gang, and the Trump Administration has never produced any evidence that they were. Almost none of them were ever convicted of any crime, in Venezuela or the United States.

At least 62 of the men in the Human Rights Watch-Cristosal report had fled Maduro’s repression or violence in Venezuela and had pending asylum cases in the United States, before they were arbitrarily rounded up and deported. According to the report, Department of Homeland Security agents lied to them about where they were being sent and refused their requests to contact their families. During the almost four months they were in CECOT, they had no access to lawyers or their families.

Excerpts from Human Rights Watch/Cristosal Report

“You Have Arrived in Hell”

Torture and Other Abuses Against Venezuelans in El Salvador’s Mega Prison

November 12, 2025

People held in CECOT said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention. Guards and riot police beat them in the hallways of the prison module and in a solitary confinement cell in a section of CECOT known as “the Island.” They beat them during daily cell searches for allegedly violating prison rules, such as speaking loudly with other detainees or showering at the wrong time, and sometimes for requesting medical treatment.

People held in CECOT said that many detainees were also beaten after US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s visit in March, following visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in May and June, and after two prison protests occurring in April and May.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal concluded that the cases of torture and ill-treatment of Venezuelans in CECOT were not isolated incidents by rogue guards or riot police, but rather systematic violations that took place repeatedly during their detention. Every former detainee interviewed reported being subjected to serious physical and psychological abuse on a near-daily basis, throughout their entire time in detention.

These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and psychological suffering. Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.

Three people held in CECOT told Human Rights Watch and Cristosal that they were subjected to sexual violence. One of them said that guards took him to “the Island,” where they beat him. He said four guards sexually abused him and forced him to perform oral sex on one of them. “They played with their batons on my body.” People held in CECOT said sexual abuse affected more people, but victims were unlikely to speak about what they had suffered due to stigma.

The United States sent the 252 Venezuelans to CECOT despite credible prior reports that torture and other abuses were taking place in El Salvador’s prisons. This violates the principle of non-refoulement, established in the Convention against Torture, among others.

In at least 19 cases, people held in CECOT or their relatives said they fled Venezuela to escape threats, abuses, or persecution by state security forces, as well as threats posed by armed and criminal groups, including Tren de Aragua. Their allegations indicate that these individuals fled persecution and, in many instances, articulated strong claims for asylum.”

Human Rights Watch analyzed data on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations that ICE released in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request made by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy. The data indicates that at least 48.8 percent of the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador on March 15, March 30, and April 12—the dates of flights Human Rights Watch confirmed transported Venezuelans to CECOT—had no criminal history in the United States. Only 8 (3.1 percent) had been convicted of a violent or potentially violent offense. The data only includes information on 226 of the 252 Venezuelan people who were held in CECOT.

The government is ordered to hold the bond hearing on or before Nov. 18. The hearing that was originally set in federal court Thursday has been canceled.

Parents who leave their children at Rayito de Sol Spanish immersion day care and preschool on Chicago's North Side voiced concern last week after Santillana Galeano was detained.

The Colombian day care teacher was being held at the Broadview U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility before being transferred to Clark County, Indiana, as of last Friday.

A federal judge previously barred the Trump administration from removing Santillana Galeano, 38, from the U.S. and transferring her to any federal jurisdiction outside of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, court documents show.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Santillana Galeano was arrested for human trafficking. A statement from the agency alleges she paid traffickers to bring to two teenage children to the U.S.

DHS reports Galeano and a man driving her car refused to stop and then fled into the day care, barricading themselves inside.

Some who witnessed the incident and viewed video at the day care refute that claim, instead alleging armed ICE agents went room to room inside the day care.

Court records state Santillana Galeano has applied for either asylum or withholding of removal and was granted a work permit that is valid through Nov. 12, 2029.

Judge Daniel also ordered a bond hearing for the father of a teen cancer patient, who was being held in Clark County.

Rogelio Bolufé told Source New Mexico in a phone interview in Spanish on Tuesday that an abruptly cancelled meeting with a legal aid group last week hobbled his chances at convincing an immigration judge to spare him deportation to Cuba, where he says he’ll face imprisonment and torture as a political dissident.

“If I go back to Cuba, my life will be in danger,” he said.

His allegations of denied access to lawyers and legal materials occur as the facility, one of three ICE lockups in the state, operates without a contract. It currently holds about 550 ICE detainees.

Amid a federal government shutdown, an inter-governmental services agreement between the county, ICE and private prison operator CoreCivic expired Oct. 31, and it remains unclear when it will be renewed.

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter to ICE on Friday demanding the agency answer what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime.

Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

“I reiterate my calls for ICE to close the facility, but if you will not, I urge you to transfer all ICE detainees out of TCDF immediately until such time that the contract between ICE and Torrance County is extended,” Heinrich wrote.

Innovation Law Lab, an organization of immigrant legal advocates who visit the jail weekly, have said ICE’s own policies require the agency to remove detainees and their equipment absent a contract.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry Wednesday about Heinrich’s letter, which cites recent Source New Mexico reporting and public statements from ICE about its continued operations during the shutdown. Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, said Wednesday that ICE hadn’t responded to the senator’s office yet.

Bolufé, 43, told Source the contract’s expiration worsened a long practice of officials’ denying legal help to him or his fellow detainees, including a canceled meeting with legal advocates last Thursday. Bolufé documented that incident and others in a letter last week to Source signed by six other immigrant detainees.

Bolufé’s letter also cited poor quality telephone communication; jail staff disruptions to consultations with legal staff; and lack of access to the jail’s legal library.

“In practice, it is impossible to access the legal library,” Bolufé wrote, noting he made 30 requests through jail tablets for appointments at the legal library and received no response.

Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s close friend and former fianceé, facilitated brief jail phone calls between Bolufé and Source this week and sent Source letters detailing his history in ICE custody. She wrote that she’s tried to send books and other legal materials to Bolufé at the facility without success.

“I have personally sent Rogelio several legal books and materials intended to support his preparation for court, but these have been withheld pending review and approval by the facility’s director, and as of today, they have not been delivered to him,” she wrote on Nov. 7.

Rubena Miranda, administrative supervisor at the facility, declined to comment Wednesday, and referred comment to public affairs officials at CoreCivic. CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company would provide a response, but had not by publication. Source will update the story if it is received.

A long journey to NM

Bolufé arrived at the Torrance County jail about two months ago and, he says, has spent some of his time collecting testimony from inmates who, like him, spent time at “Alligator Alcatraz.”

According to Bolufé, he spent between seven and 10 days in “Alligator Alcatraz,” during which he was chained by his hands and feet for 24 to 36 hours at a time. The facility had freezing temperatures, inadequate blankets and the lights remained on permanently.

As a result of the treatment, he said he lost mobility in his left hand, as well as other pain, numbness and muscle weakness, and jail guards shouted racist slurs at him and other detainees.

Bolufé said the letters and accounts of abuse would help him plead his case to federal immigration Judge Brock E. Taylor, and bring the allegations about ICE’s treatment of detainees to the judge’s attention, but they are among the materials he has yet to receive, along with a character reference signed by 40 people. He also intends on Thursday to argue that he would be subject to political persecution upon being deported to Cuba.

Bolufé is seeking a Green Card under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which allows Cubans a streamlined path to permanent residency. While he acknowledges and media reports confirm that he has long-standing ties to former Cuban President Fidel Castro and his sons, he also said he is waging a campaign to liberate the country from the Communist regime and supports President Donald Trump.

Bolufé said his Green Card application was pending when he was arrested in the Miami area in August, accused of possessing a small amount of cocaine. He denies the cocaine belonged to him, and the charges have since been dropped, according to court records. Prosecutors in Miami-Dade County did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request on Wednesday about the case.

Ahead of the court hearing Thursday, Bolufé said he is hoping for the best, but he said his case is just one of many of immigrants who have been subject to abuse, deprived of human rights and threatened with deportation without having committed crimes.

Mustapha Djemali is the founder and director of the Tunisian Council for Refugees (CTR). Abderrazek Krimi is a project manager with the same organization. Both have been held in arbitrary pre-trial detention since May 2024. They were arrested only because of their legitimate human rights work and for exercising their right to freedom of association.

The CTR, a Tunisian organization that works with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), provides vital support to refugees and asylum seekers in Tunisia.

Tunisian authorities must immediately release Mustapha Djemali and Abderrazek Krimi and drop all charges against them. They must also ensure that human rights defenders can continue their work freely and safely, without fear of reprisals.

Write to President of Tunisia urging the government to:

Ensure the immediate release of Mustapha Djemali and Abderrazek Krimi.

Drop all charges against them.

Stop targeting and arresting human rights defenders.

Guarantee that human rights defenders can do their work freely and safely, without fear of reprisals.

Crackdown on civil society and refugee rights

In early May 2024, the Tunisian government began a sweeping crackdown on refugees, migrants, and the organizations defending their rights.

On May 6, President Kais Saied made public remarks attacking groups working on migration issues. He accused them of trying to “settle” migrants in Tunisia and called them “traitors” and “foreign agents.” He claimed that “networks inside” Tunisia were linked to “networks abroad” and receiving money under the false claim of protecting migrants.

The next day, a Tunis prosecutor opened an investigation into associations accused of “abusing their mandate to provide financial support” to irregular migrants.

Widespread arrests and intimidation

Since then, authorities have summoned, arrested, and investigated leaders, staff, and members of at least 20 organizations. Ten human rights defenders, NGO workers, and local officials have been placed in arbitrary pre-trial detention on accusations of supporting irregular migrants or misusing NGO funds.

That same month, the government carried out forced evictions of refugees and migrants. Some landlords were convicted for renting apartments to people without regular status.

These actions mark one of the most severe escalations against refugee and migrant rights in Tunisia since February 2023. They are part of a broader pattern of racially discriminatory language and practices. Similar efforts to criminalize refugee and migrant rights defenders have also been observed in Europe and beyond.

The targeting of the Tunisian Council for Refugees

The Tunisian Council for Refugees (CTR), founded in 2016, was one of the first groups targeted. The CTR works with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)and Tunisian authorities to pre-register asylum seekers and provide essential support to refugees in need.

Its founder, Mustapha Djemali, is a former senior UNHCR official. On May 2, 2024, the CTR published a public tender for hotel accommodations to shelter refugees and asylum seekers in vulnerable situations. This was a routine part of its work and done in response to a request from the UNHCR and the region of Sfax.

Soon after, Tunisian media outlets and social media users spread screenshots of the tender. They accused civil society of conspiring to “settle” Africans or “illegal migrants” in Tunisia, using racist and xenophobic language.

Arrests and suspension of humanitarian work

On May 3, police raided the CTR office in Tunis and arrested Mustapha Djemali. The next day, they arrested Abderrazek Krimi, the CTR project manager.

Police questioned them about the organization’s funding, its support for irregular migrants, and the call for tenders. Following their arrests, the CTR suspended its activities. This led to serious disruptions in access to asylum procedures and essential services, including health care, shelter, and child protection.

Unfair detention and ongoing trial

On May 7, 2024, an investigating judge at the Tunis Court of First Instance ordered six months of pre-trial detention for both defenders. They were charged with “forming an alliance or organization” to “plan, assist, or organize” the irregular entry of people into Tunisia and with “providing them shelter.”

These charges are vague and unfounded. They do not include any evidence of material gain or exploitation; the elements that define human smuggling and trafficking under international law.

The judge extended their detention in October 2024 and again in February 2025, which should be the final extension allowed by law. Despite several requests, the court has rejected conditional release. Authorities also froze the personal bank accounts of both defenders and the CTR.

An independent expert report submitted in March 2025 found no financial irregularities. Yet, during a hearing on March 25, the judge told the defenders, “You brought Black people into Tunisia illegally and you feed and shelter them. Tunisian history and laws will make you pay for it.” This statement raises serious concerns about bias and fairness in the proceedings.

On April 30, 2025, the investigation was closed. On June 3, 2025, the indictment chamber decided to send the case to trial.",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mustapha-Djemali-UA.png,N,,2025-11-12 17:56:37.292953

“For nearly four years, Petitioner Diego Leandro Velasquez Rincon lived freely and lawfully in the United States, having been paroled upon an immigration judge’s finding that he had a credible fear of persecution or torture if returned to his native Colombia. However, on August 13, 2025, Petitioner was re-detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) following an unrelated court appearance. By the authority purportedly relied upon for his detention, Petitioner has no right to a bond hearing, meaning that he is to be detained without the possibility of release until the conclusion of his still-ongoing asylum proceedings, an administrative process that can drag on for years due, in part, to a growing backlog of such cases.

“Typically, such executive detention without recourse to an individualized hearing and a neutral decisionmaker would raise serious due-process concerns. …

“Notwithstanding, Respondents argue that detention can be maintained without any consideration of the Due Process Clause because of a legal fiction — the so-called ‘entry fiction doctrine’ — which disregards the objective reality of a non-citizen’s physical presence in the United States and instead pretends that the individual has been ‘stopped at the border’ and never permitted to enter. …

“But the Supreme Court has never applied the entry fiction doctrine to a case like this — to constitutionally justify the detention of a person living freely, for years, within the United States — and its expansion here cannot be justified. … Pretending that Petitioner never entered the United States not only subordinates fact to fiction, it disregards the plain meaning of the Due Process Clause, which promises its protection to every ‘person’ within the United States. …

“… Granting Petitioner a bond hearing does not ‘undermine’ Congress’s authority over his admission process. … After a bond hearing — which may or may not result in his release from detention — Petitioner will be subject to the same removal proceedings as before, with no new right to remain. A bond hearing is the very procedure laid out in statute and in regulation for closely situated individuals. It leaves the determination of whether Petitioner poses a flight risk or a danger to his community in the competent hands of the immigration court. In short, it is a minimal imposition to ensure that Petitioner’s detention remains tethered to its lawful purpose.

“Accordingly, for these reasons and for those stated below, the Court will grant the Petition in part and order that Petitioner receive a bond hearing to consider the merits of his release. …

Former detainees described daily beatings, sexual abuse, and starvation inside the ultra-secure Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, which many of the migrants called “hell.” Most were accused—without trial—of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were held incommunicado for months, despite having no criminal record.

“The Trump administration paid El Salvador millions of dollars to arbitrarily detain Venezuelans, who were then subjected almost daily to brutal beatings by Salvadoran security forces,” said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch in a press release. “The Trump administration has been complicit in torture, enforced disappearances, and other serious human rights violations, and it should stop sending people to El Salvador or any other country where they face the risk of being tortured.”

Prisoners reported overcrowded cells, poor ventilation, inadequate food, lack of medical care and prolonged solitary confinement. Every former detainee interviewed by the nonprofit organizations said he endured repeated physical and psychological abuse.

Some of those deported had fled persecution by the regime of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, which has forced nearly eight million people to flee the country. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal noted that some of the CECOT detainees who were later returned to Venezuela reported visits from government intelligence agents attempting to coerce statements about their treatment in the United States.

On July 18, following a prisoner exchange, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in return for the repatriation of more than 250 Venezuelan migrants who had been transferred from the U.S. to El Salvador months earlier under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Between March and September 2025, Human Rights Watch interviewed 150 people—including relatives, friends, employers, and lawyers of detainees in Venezuela, Colombia, and the U.S.—as well as 40 former detainees released from CECOT. Based on their accounts, the organizations documented 130 confirmed cases of Venezuelans transferred to the prison. Cristosal provided legal support to relatives of 76 detainees, filing habeas corpus petitions before El Salvador’s Supreme Court.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal concluded that roughly half of those Venezuelans sent to CECOT had no criminal convictions, and only three percent had been convicted in the U.S. of a violent or potentially violent crime. Additional background checks revealed that many had not been convicted of any offense in Venezuela or other Latin American countries where they had lived.

Family members and attorneys said at least 62 Venezuelans were deported to El Salvador while their asylum cases in the United States were still pending, despite having passed an initial “credible fear” assessment entitling them to a full asylum hearing. Three others said they had entered the U.S. through the government’s Safe Mobility Offices program—implemented in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala—to offer legal pathways for eligible migrants and refugees.

The Miami Herald reported on March 27 about a 24-year-old Venezuelan father living in Tampa, who had an active asylum claim, who was deported to El Salvador after Homeland Security officials said he “may be a Tren de Aragua associate,” referring to the Venezuelan gang.

The human-rights groups’ findings also align with a March 21 Herald report documenting the case of a Venezuelan man who had been granted refugee status through the Safe Mobility Offices program in Colombia but was nonetheless deported to El Salvador. He was detained after flying into Houston from Colombia with his girlfriend after authorities noticed his tattoos. Despite having legal authorization to enter the United States and no criminal record, immigration officials concluded that his tattoos were sufficient to suspect he might be linked to the Tren de Aragua gang.

According to the report by the nonprofit organizations, an expert on the Tren de Aragua said in a sworn declaration that tattoos and hand gestures are not “reliable” or “credible” indicators of gang affiliation. The Herald previously reported that experts on the Venezuelan gang have found no evidence that tattoos or visible markings are used by the group to identify members. They said the gang—which originated in a notorious Venezuelan prison—does not use visible symbols, and that profiling individuals based on tattoos is likely to result in serious miscarriages of justice.

Investigators corroborated detainee testimonies through forensic analyses by the Independent Forensic Expert Group and open-source research by the Human Rights Center’s Investigations Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

The report highlights the involvement of the U.S. government, noting that the Trump administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act and other mechanisms to deport Venezuelans under alleged gang or “terrorist” affiliations, while Salvadoran officials failed to provide oversight or accountability. The investigation also found that the U.S. government paid at least US $4.7 million to El Salvador in connection with detaining the migrants at CECOT.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal called on the U.S. government to halt all deportations to El Salvador, disclose related bilateral agreements, rescind the March 2025 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, suspend funding to Salvadoran security forces, and allow deported Venezuelans to resume asylum proceedings or receive Temporary Protected Status.

The organizations also urged Salvadoran authorities to investigate abuses, hold officials accountable, end incommunicado detention, improve prison conditions, and permit oversight access. Venezuelan authorities were called on to protect returnees from reprisals and provide medical, psychological and legal support.

The investigation placed the abuses within El Salvador’s broader prison system under President Nayib Bukele, whose tenure has been marked by mass incarcerations, limited transparency and recurring human rights violations. The human rights groups conclude that the torture and mistreatment at CECOT were not isolated incidents but part of a systematic pattern that raise grave concerns about the rule of law, migrant protections and U.S. complicity in transfers to facilities with little or no oversight.

“The United States government has not engaged in acts of systematic torture on this scale since Abu Ghraib and the network of secret prisons during the war on terror,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal. “For a government to make people disappear while subjecting them to torture undermines the principles that have historically made the United States a nation of laws.”

November 11, 2025

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing Harris County for allocating county funds to programs that help undocumented people get access to legal support.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and last month appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

In a statement, Paxton called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. This is the latest in a flurry of headline-grabbing lawsuits filed by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, aimed at organizations that support immigrants.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

The lawsuit was filed in Harris County District Court. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that the program was “perfectly legal” and his office would defend it in court.

“This lawsuit is a cheap political stunt,” he said. “At a time when the president has unleashed ICE agents to terrorize immigrant neighborhoods, deport U.S. citizens, and trample the law, it’s shameful that Republican state officials are joining in instead of standing up for Texans.”

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He is asking the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: Menefee said his office would “fight back” against this lawsuit, calling it a “cheap political stunt.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",http://media.iadsnetwork.com/facebookthumbnail/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 16:57:10.274249

Over the course of October, the Bevan Foundation’s work stimulated debate amongst Welsh politicians on issues facing people experiencing hardship in Wales. We helped to keep the focus on a range of choices which could be made in the interests of furthering social justice, facing both the current Welsh Government in the final six months of this Senedd term as well as the next.

The impacts of the UK Government’s Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill on asylum seekers in Wales

The Bevan Foundation has raised concerns about the UK government’s Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025, introduced to the UK Parliament at the beginning of this year. We have argued that it builds on existing statutory frameworks which fail to provide adequate safeguards for children, and unjustly criminalises the seeking of asylum. As such, the Bill is incompatible with the obligations placed on state and devolved governments under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the UN Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings, as well as the Welsh Government’s stated approach to supporting asylum-seeking children in Wales.

Sioned Williams MS raised our concerns in a debate on the Legislative Consent Motion on the Bill on 21 October:

“As has been noted by the likes of the Bevan Foundation and the Refugee and Migrant Children’s Consortium, the Bill retains elements of both the IMA 2023 and the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 that undermine the rights of asylum seekers, including, from a Welsh perspective, the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 and the overarching principle of ‘child first, migrant second’. Indeed, in its desperate and counterproductive attempt to co-opt the discourse of the hard right, the current UK Government has also introduced through this Bill further powers that will exacerbate, rather than remove, harm in this area, in particular expanding criteria for criminalising people who have no recourse to safe routes of asylum.”

Sioned Williams MS

Child poverty

On 1 October, there was a debate in the Senedd on child poverty. The Bevan Foundation’s work was referenced during the debate by a number of Senedd members.

Jenny Rathbone MS referred to our work with Policy in Practice modelling the impacts of various interventions on poverty, and asked members to consider how one of these measures, a Welsh child payment for each child living in a low-income household, might be brought into effect in the devolved context:

“But now turning to what the Welsh Government can do, the Bevan Foundation commissioned Policy in Practice to look at six actions that could reduce child poverty. One of them was the Welsh child payment, which has just been discussed by earlier speakers. I wonder how easy that would be to do, given that we still don’t have control over welfare benefits administration, because I recall that when we introduced the universal basic income for care leavers, the UK Government decided to remove the benefits that those young people were entitled to. That effectively nullified the impact of the policy, which was a pretty disgraceful way of testing a new policy to ensure that care leavers have better outcomes.”

Jenny Rathbone MS

Cefin Campbell MS noted our work highlighting that poverty is not homogeneous across Wales, and that rural communities face particular challenges:

“…We also know from various studies that rural poverty is a multidimensional and complex phenomenon. According to the Bevan Foundation, rural families face a triple squeeze, with rapidly rising living costs, low wages, and insufficient support from the state, including unreliable public services. And as a result, many parents are being forced to make the cruel, exceptionally difficult choice between heating their homes or feeding their children.

We know that failures of policy in different areas have a greater impact on families in rural communities and contribute to worse than average poverty levels. These include poor public transport links, a lack of affordable housing, higher energy costs, piecemeal childcare provision, patchy digital access, limited access to training and barriers to further education, and of course fewer well-paid job opportunities.”

Cefin Campbell MS

Jane Hutt, the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, highlighted the impact on household budgets of the introduction of universal free school meals in Welsh primary schools, using the estimates we made in 2021 of the savings families were likely to experience as a result of this policy:

“Our universal offer, alongside our school milk scheme and long-standing free school breakfasts in primary schools, means that Wales has the most generous food-in-school offer in the UK. It’s important to put that on the record again for us today, making strides together. In 2021, the Bevan Foundation estimated that a free school meal was worth an average of £764 a year per child, and that averages to a financial contribution per child of just under £15 a week, getting money into the pockets of families for those children.”

Jane Hutt MS, Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Trefnydd and Chief Whip

There was further discussion on child poverty during the Senedd’s debate on the Children’s Commissioner for Wales’s annual report 2024-25. Sioned Williams MS drew further attention to our modelling work with Policy in Practice which provided evidence that a child payment would result in the largest reduction in child poverty out of a set of six potential policy interventions:

“The Bevan Foundation has said that the child payment would be the most effective policy for tackling child poverty in Wales. Plaid Cymru agrees with these experts, and reflects the call made by the children’s commissioner and the opinion of all these experts. As we repeatedly did in relation to free school meals, we have asked the Welsh Government to support this call. We ask them again today to reconsider, and for the entire Senedd to show the same clear focus as the children’s commissioner, who shows such firm and articulate leadership on the issue of child poverty with this call.”

Sioned Williams MS

The Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice also made reference to the report’s findings:

“The key thing is using our levers—using our levers that we currently have at our disposal—to support children and their families. And I think it was helpful to look at the Bevan Foundation and Policy in Practice report on what are the levers that we can use to tackle child poverty. And, in that report, they said there are three important messages. There is no one single measure that ends poverty; the Welsh Government needs to use all the tools at its disposal if it’s to make progress. And, secondly, it’s only possible to make long-term changes to poverty if action is taken to remove barriers to work and to boost social security.

The Cabinet Secretary also acknowledged that the limitations of the devolution settlement may pose a challenge to the Welsh Government if it wanted to introduce a child payment in Wales:

“I think, of course, it has been recognised, and it was recognised by the Bevan Foundation and Policy in Practice, that Wales hasn’t been given the same social security powers as Scotland, and it is unclear whether the Welsh Government could introduce a similar child payment under its devolved powers. That’s not me saying that, that’s Policy in Practice and the Bevan Foundation, so we do have to look at that carefully.”

The letter, which was first reported by Reuters, told governors that their states are providing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies “with frictionless, self-service access to the personal data of all of your residents,” through a nonprofit managed by state police agencies called the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, or Nlets.

Nlets facilitates the sharing of state residents’ personal data, in this case driver license data, between state, local, and federal police agencies.

The lawmakers asked the group of governors to stop the practice and block access to ICE and “other federal agencies that are now acting as Trump’s shock troops.”

ICE and Nlets did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

For two decades, most states have made their residents’ data, such as drivers’ licenses and other information from each state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database, available for search and retrieval to approximately 18,000 federal and local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada. This practice allows those agencies to directly access residents’ data without the knowledge or involvement of any state employee, according to the letter.

The letter said that it’s possible that ICE is using drivers’ license photos for their facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which agents are using to identify people on the street and relies on 200 million photos.

According to the letter, Nlets facilitated “over 290 million queries for DMV data,” with more than 290,000 queries from ICE and some 600,000 from Homeland Security Investigations during the year before October 1, 2025.

“It is now abundantly clear that a major reason that so few states have locked down the data they share through Nlets is because of an information gap,” reads the letter. “Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” read the letter.

The letter said blocking the agencies’ “unfettered access” would not prevent federal agencies obtaining information from states for solving serious crimes, but taking action would “increase accountability and reduce abuse” by allowing state employees to review data requests first.

The lawmakers noted that some states, including Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington recently restricted what kind of data ICE can access via Nlets, and reminded the governors that it is up to them to stop the practice at any time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice-agent.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-11-12 17:56:45.196981

Judge Jeffrey Cummings sided with attorneys representing detainees who said DHS violated a consent decree that limits the ability of federal agents to conduct warrantless arrests. The judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide information about how many of the 615 migrants represented in the lawsuit are still in the country or have criminal records.

Migrants who have criminal records and pose a risk to the public would not be eligible for release. Those who are eligible for release could be monitored through alternative means like ankle monitors.

An American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson told ABC News that a judge ordered the release of an additional 13 migrants within the next two days who would not be placed in ankle monitors.

The consent decree is in effect until February 2026 and covers Illinois and five other neighboring states. Generally speaking (with some exceptions), under the agreement, federal immigration officials are restricted from conducting warrantless arrests unless they have reason to believe a person has committed an offense and would be likely to flee before they're able to be detained.

In a social media post, DHS said the judge's order puts Americans at risk.

""At every turn activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst. Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community,"" DHS said.

Last month, Judge Cummings ruled agents had violated a previously agreed-upon consent decree over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area known as the 2022 Castañon Nava settlement.

Since that ruling, attorneys on both sides of the case have been working to identify how many people arrested by immigration agents this year violated the previously agreed-upon consent decree.

Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center believes cases like these are happening daily.

""As we're digging into it, we are very concerned that many, if not most [ of ICE arrests ] , are violations of our consent decree,"" Fleming told the I-Team.

Fleming said so far, the list of people arrested in violation of the consent decree has grown to more than 3,000 people.

""Our initial analysis is that it's over 3,000 arrests,"" Fleming told the I-Team. ""We've started to dig into the case file that they produced to us, and the vast majority are violations. If they did not have a prior order of removal, in almost all circumstances, they've been uniformly violating the consent decree.""

So far, Fleming said that ICE has produced a list of 3,800 people, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol has given a list of 1,200 people, but he stressed that there may be duplicate entries on both lists, so his team does not have a solid total figure yet. Also, those lists were only through the beginning of October, and do not include arrests in the last month.

Attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security have argued that Congress stripped federal courts of their authority to grant parole to large groups of immigrants in ICE custody.

In their filings, government attorneys argue, ""Congress has vested the authority to grant parole solely with the Secretary of Homeland Security... Federal courts cannot order the Department of Homeland Security to release any aliens on parole because Congress has stripped them of that authority.""

In their review of people arrested by agents potentially in violation of the consent decree, Fleming said more than 1,000 people are no longer in the U.S., meaning they may have been deported already after signing voluntary removal orders.

""A lot of these folks have never had any interaction with law enforcement before, nor been subject to detention, and so it's horrifying,"" Fleming explained.

Fleming continued, ""What we've raised to the court is if you don't provide this interim relief, there will be no one left. At the end of this, we may find thousands of violations, but there may be no one left.""

The shooting happened just after 7:30 a.m. on Nov. 8 at Mission Landscape Supplies off Stahl Road near Jung Road on the Northeast Side.

RELATED: Victims identified in deadly landscaping business shooting

Police said 21-year-old Jose David Hernandez Galo opened fire on employees, killing three people, Selvin Chacon, 48; Sergio Chacon, 38; and Karen Bautista, 24, before taking his own life.

Hernandez was employed by the business at the time of the shooting.

On Wednesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released the following statement:

Murder suspect in triple murder/suicide shooting at a San Antonio, Texas landscaping business on Nov. 9 was an illegal alien from Honduras. Jose David Hernandez Galo, 21, illegally entered the United States on April 16, 2019, as a minor, with his family unit, Jose Pedro Hernandez-Machado, 44, by crossing the Rio Grande River in El Paso, Texas at a location not designated as an entry port. On that same date, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested the family unit and served them with a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

This senseless tragedy could have been prevented. The family unit has not reported in to ICE since July 2022. The Biden administration policies at the time did not consider Galo, or his family unit, a priority.

Investigators said Hernandez Galo arrived at business, then began shooting, striking three co-workers. Other employees ran for cover as police warned nearby residents to shelter in place. A large manhunt involving SWAT and K-9 units ended nearly four hours later when Hernandez was found dead nearby with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police Chief William McManus said the shooting was targeted, though the motive remains unclear.

ICE officials highlighted an ongoing federal initiative that encourages voluntary self-deportation. The agency noted that migrants in the country illegally can use a government mobile app to arrange their departure and potentially qualify for financial assistance to return home.

Illegal aliens can take control of their departure with the CBP Home App. The U. S. is offering illegal aliens $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport now. We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right legal way to live American dream. If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return.

It found that an IJ improperly terminated a “withholding only” case involving a Honduran national who reentered illegally after removal. The bigger questions are why Biden-era regulations even allow such terminations, and whether Trump II plans on scrapping those regulations.

“Limited Proceedings”

Aliens who are inadmissible under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or deportable under section 237(a) of the INA usually have their removability determined and eligibility for “relief” from removal (like asylum) adjudicated in removal proceedings under section 240 of the INA.

But section 240 removal proceedings are just one way in which questions involving alien removals are considered.

Pursuant to regulation, certain aliens seeking asylum, “statutory withholding” under section 241(b)(3) of the INA, and protection under Article III of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) — collectively “humanitarian protection” — are not entitled to the protections accorded in section 240 removal proceedings, but may only have their claims heard in “asylum-only” proceedings.

Such proceedings are the only forum for consideration of humanitarian protection claims by certain alien crewmembers, stowaways, applicants for admission under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), VWP overstays, and a handful of other aliens with limited due process rights in this country.

Then, there are aliens who reenter illegally after deportation pursuant to removal orders.

Section 241(a)(5) of the INA permits DHS to reinstate such orders without placing those aliens into removal proceedings again, but that doesn’t mean they will be immediately removed.

That’s because if such alien “reentrants” claim a fear of persecution or torture, they must, by regulation, be referred to a USCIS asylum officer to determine whether they have a “reasonable fear” of return.

Illegal reentrants aren’t eligible for asylum, but if an asylum officer concludes that they have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, DHS must place them into “withholding-only” proceedings before IJs to seek statutory withholding or CAT protection.

Asylum-only and withholding-only proceedings are both “limited proceedings”: the only issue before the immigration court is whether the alien is eligible for the available humanitarian relief. Other forms of relief (like adjustment of status) are off the table, and aliens in limited proceedings are barred from claiming they aren’t removable.

J-A-N-M-

The respondent in the BIA case, J-A-N-M-, is a Honduran national who was initially removed from the United States in August 2006. He thereafter reentered illegally at an unspecified time and place, and after DHS found him, the department reinstated his prior removal order in July 2024.

J-A-N-M- claimed he’d be harmed if returned to Honduras, an asylum officer found he had a reasonable fear, and in October 2024, DHS placed him into withholding-only proceedings.

In those proceedings, the IJ — having concluded J-A-N-M- was not credible — denied his applications for statutory withholding and CAT.

Issues arose in the case, however, because J-A-N-M- apparently also claims to have been a victim of criminal activity, as the record shows he has an application for a nonimmigrant “U visa” pending.

J-A-N-M- asked the IJ to administratively close — that is, shelve his withholding-only case indefinitely — while USCIS considers that U visa application, but because he was detained, the IJ denied that request.

For reasons that are unexplained in the BIA’s opinion, however, even though the IJ denied J-A-N-M-‘s request for administrative closure, he granted the alien’s request for “discretionary termination” of his withholding-only case.

“Discretionary Termination”

IJs have only had regulatory authority to terminate cases involving facially removable aliens like J-A-N-M- since May 2024, when the Biden administration published a final rule titled “Efficient Case and Docket Management in Immigration Proceedings”.

Among other things, that rule amended a prior regulation first implemented in 1997 (later recodified at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18), which prior to amendment solely governed the scheduling of cases — not their closure or termination.

The Biden-era rule rebranded the regulation “Docket Management” and (among other things) amended it to expand the authority of IJs to administratively close or alternatively terminate immigration cases filed by DHS.

As currently written, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(d)(2)(ii), “Other Proceedings ... Discretionary Termination”, states, in pertinent part:

In proceedings other than removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings, immigration judges may, in the exercise of discretion, terminate the case upon the motion of a party where terminating the case is necessary or appropriate for the disposition or alternative resolution of the case. However, immigration judges may not terminate a case for purely humanitarian reasons, unless DHS expressly consents to such termination, joins in a motion to terminate, or affirmatively indicates its non-opposition to a noncitizen's motion.

That was the authority the IJ relied on in terminating J-A-N-M-‘s withholding-only proceeding, and notably, the IJ terminated that case over DHS’s objection.

Matter of J-A-N-M-

DHS appealed that termination order, teeing the matter up for the BIA’s precedent opinion in Matter of J-A-N-M-.

Briefly, the Board held the IJ erred by not reading the next subparagraph in that Biden-era regulation, § 1003.18(d)(2)(iii), which specifically bars terminations of, inter alia, withholding-only proceedings “where prohibited by another regulatory provision”.

The other provision in question here is 8 C.F.R. § 1208.2(c)(3)(i), under which “all parties are prohibited from raising or considering any other issues” in withholding-only proceedings aside from whether the alien is eligible for statutory withholding and CAT, “including but not limited to issues of admissibility, deportability, eligibility for waivers, and eligibility for any other form of relief”.

Thus, the regulation barred the IJ from considering whether J-A-N-M- may also be eligible for other forms of relief (like a U visa) that could be adjudicated by a third agency (like USCIS) after termination.

On that basis, the BIA reversed the IJ.

The Bigger Issues

Note that the Biden administration only expanded 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18 to allow IJs to close and terminate pending cases after it had issued guidance to DHS attorneys encouraging them to administratively close, terminate, and dismiss then-pending cases that didn’t fit within its anti-enforcement “priorities”.

That guidance took a major toll on our immigration system. As the House Judiciary Committee explained in October 2024: “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, more than 700,000 illegal aliens ... had their cases dismissed, terminated, or administratively closed, allowing those aliens to stay in the country indefinitely without facing immigration consequences.”

In any event, by granting IJs termination and closure authority, the regulation ignores 42 years of case law, beginning with the BIA’s 1982 opinion in Matter of Quintero, where the Board held IJs:

may neither terminate nor indefinitely adjourn the proceedings in order to delay an alien's deportation. ... Once deportation proceedings have been initiated by [now DHS], the immigration judge may not review the wisdom of the [now-DHS's] action, but must execute his duty to determine whether the deportation charge is sustained by the requisite evidence in an expeditious manner.

Despite that fact, the authors of the rule contended it “neither alters, impacts, nor diminishes DHS’s prosecutorial authority or discretion” — a questionable contention, at best.

Even if you accept the argument that Biden’s DHS had “prosecutorial discretion” to ignore Congress’s detention and removal mandates in the INA, no judge in our system of justice — immigration or otherwise — can also be a “prosecutor”, or be given discretion to terminate a validly filed immigration case for any reason aside from the government’s inability to sustain its removal charges.

But by allowing IJs to terminate and close pending cases involving facially removable aliens over the government’s objections, that’s exactly what this regulation does. True, the rule prevents IJ’s from terminating cases “for purely humanitarian reasons” (whatever that means) over the government’s objection, but all other cases are fair game.

Moreover, the drafters of the rule argued that it doesn’t “authorize immigration judges ... to unilaterally decline to adjudicate cases, as administratively closed cases still remain pending on EOIR’s docket”.

That ignores the fact that, as of the end of June, more than 9.5 percent of the nearly 3.8 million cases pending before IJs were administratively closed (almost 362,000 in total), and that the “average length of time a case has been administratively closed” before an IJ at that point was just about “16 years”.

To be fair, the median length of time cases before IJs were administratively closed in June was a more modest 11-plus years, but still, that’s a long time for any case to “remain pending on EOIR’s docket”.

In its efforts to restore credibility to our immigration system, the Trump administration might want to look at the expansive regulatory authority its predecessor gave IJs to terminate and close immigration cases. The Board of Immigration Appeals’ latest decision offers a good vantage point from which to begin.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/CourtJudgeSocial.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:57:08.758744

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and last month appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

In a statement, Paxton called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. This is the latest in a flurry of headline-grabbing lawsuits filed by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, aimed at organizations that support immigrants.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

The lawsuit was filed in Harris County District Court. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that the program was “perfectly legal” and his office would defend it in court.

“This lawsuit is a cheap political stunt,” he said. “At a time when the president has unleashed ICE agents to terrorize immigrant neighborhoods, deport U.S. citizens, and trample the law, it’s shameful that Republican state officials are joining in instead of standing up for Texans.”

The background:

When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90% of the time, compared to like 5% of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing:

Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He is asking the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says:

Menefee said his office would “fight back” against this lawsuit, calling it a “cheap political stunt.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He is asking the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

Menefee said his office would “fight back” against this lawsuit, calling it a “cheap political stunt.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”

State of Ariz., State v. Koert, No.","In a move that may fundamentally alter defamation litigation in Arizona, Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell in State v. Koert recently requested that the Maricopa County Superior Court declare Arizona’s anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute unconstitutional.1

Arizona is one of 38 states that has an anti-SLAPP statute, designed to protect First Amendment rights. The statute allows a defamation defendant to quickly move to dismiss the case and request compensation for their attorney’s fees, rather than suffer through protracted litigation. A person sued for exercising their First Amendment rights may file a “motion to dismiss or quash” the lawsuit within 60 days.2 If the lawsuit was “substantially motivated by a desire to deter, retaliate against or prevent the lawful exercise of a constitutional right,”3 then the Court can dismiss the lawsuit after an initial hearing.4 This process is relatively speedy and much less costly than litigation and trial.

Arizona’s anti-SLAPP statute applies to both civil and criminal cases. Only in Arizona can a criminal defendant seek to have their indictment dismissed under this statute — and it applies where prosecutorial authorities are “substantially motivated” by a desire to deter, retaliate against, or prevent the lawful exercise of a constitutional right.5

The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (MCAO) charged Ms. Koert, along with 67 other defendants, with criminal trespass stemming from a pro-Palestine protest at Arizona State University’s Tempe campus in April 2024.6 Koert moved to dismiss the indictment under the anti-SLAPP law on the ground that the charging decision interfered with her right to protest.7 The Justice Court found that Koert had met her initial “prima facie” burden under the anti-SLAPP law and ordered an evidentiary hearing, shifting the burden to MCAO to justify its charging decision.8 As part of that evidentiary hearing, the Justice Court allowed Koert to issue a subpoena requiring Rachel Mitchell and her Deputy County Attorneys involved in the charging decision to testify about their motivations in making the decision to prosecute Koert.9

The County Attorney filed a petition for special action in Maricopa County Superior Court, seeking to prevent the evidentiary hearing. Although the County Attorney argues primarily that the Justice Court had misapplied the anti-SLAPP law, she also asserts “in the alternative” that the anti-SLAPP “statute is unconstitutional as a whole.”10 The County Attorney argues that the term “substantially motivated” in the anti-SLAPP statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, because it creates inconsistent outcomes and would invalidate otherwise legal regulations on First Amendment speech that have been upheld, like reasonable “time, place, and manner” restrictions.11

The Superior Court has not yet decided whether to grant the petition. But on October 22, 2025, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (the “A.G.”) filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the County Attorney. Within the amicus brief, the A.G. argued that the anti-SLAPP law’s “novel” requirement for a defendant to make a “prima facie” showing that a lawsuit was “substantially motivated” to deter, retaliate for, or otherwise prevent the lawful exercise of First Amendment rights, has “created substantial confusion” and has allowed courts to employ “varying standards to decide cases.”12 The A.G. also raised concerns that the anti-SLAPP statute would severely delay criminal cases involving anti-SLAPP claims.13

The Koert matter is one to watch and will be consequential. We expect that no matter how the Superior Court rules, the case will eventually find its way up through the Arizona appellate courts, and we intend to keep a close watch along the way.

Several Democratic states, as well as scores of counties and cities, put various levels of restriction on law enforcement cooperation with ICE.
“Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” the letter said.
Nlets, whose acronym harks back to an earlier name, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, also did not return messages.
The push to cut ICE off from state data is another example of how state and local officials are trying to thwart or slow Trump’s mass deportation effort.","Democrat-led states are inadvertently making their drivers’ data available to U.S. immigration authorities through a little-understood digital loophole, a group of lawmakers said on Nov. 12.

In letters released on Nov. 12, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 39 other Democratic lawmakers urged like-minded governors to ensure that their residents’ data was not being vacuumed up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become the speartip of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program.

“We urge you to block ICE’s access,” the letters said. “This commonsense step will improve public safety and guard against Trump officials using your state’s data for unjustified, politicized actions, while still allowing continued collaboration on serious crimes.”

Drivers’ license data is shared between state, local, and federal police forces through a nonprofit organization called Nlets. ICE and another Department of Homeland Security body, Homeland Security Investigations, also have access to the system, the letter said, and the two agencies together accounted for nearly 900,000 queries against the database in the year prior to Oct. 1.

Several Democratic states, as well as scores of counties and cities, put various levels of restriction on law enforcement cooperation with ICE. But the letter said that only a handful of states — including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Minnesota — had blocked ICE from accessing the data they shared via Nlets, in part because state government employees were not aware of where it was going.

“Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” the letter said.

ICE did not return messages seeking comment. Nlets, whose acronym harks back to an earlier name, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, also did not return messages. Governors’ offices in the four states identified as having blocked ICE, as well as Washington state, which the letter said had recently barred ICE from its data, and Oregon, which the letter said was in the process of doing so, did not return messages.

The push to cut ICE off from state data is another example of how state and local officials are trying to thwart or slow Trump’s mass deportation effort.

But Ryan Shapiro, the executive director of the government transparency group Property of the People, said it was also an illustration of how data-swapping arrangements between state, local, and federal law enforcement bodies are often so complicated that officials do not understand what they are sharing about their citizens.

“State agencies are often far better at collecting information than they are at safeguarding it,” he said.

The BBC’s leadership is facing a looming deadline over how to reply to Trump’s legal threat to file a case in a Florida court.
It relates to an edition of Panorama broadcast last year, which spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021.
Trump has doubled down on his legal threat, stating he felt he had “an obligation” to sue the BBC.
There is anger within the BBC over the Trump edit.","The BBC is prepared to formally apologise to Donald Trump as part of its efforts to resolve his billion-dollar legal threat over its editing of one of his speeches, the Guardian understands.

However, figures at the corporation are also minded to be robust in defending its journalism in the face of allegations from Trump that it made “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” about him.

The BBC’s leadership is facing a looming deadline over how to reply to Trump’s legal threat to file a case in a Florida court. It follows the editing of a Trump speech in an edition of Panorama, which was a significant factor in the resignation of director general Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, its head of news.

Beyond a fresh apology, a critical question remains how far the BBC goes in defending its reporting more generally in the US, given claims from Trump’s allies that it publishes “fake news” in relation to him.

Its legal team has been drawing up its response to the complaint. It relates to an edition of Panorama broadcast last year, which spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021. It has been accused of making it appear that he directly encouraged the US Capitol attack later that day.

The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.

The Guardian understands that given an apology for the edit has been made by the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, senior figures see no reason why a more personal apology cannot be made to the president in its official response to the legal threat. The corporation has concluded that the edit “gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”.

People familiar with the discussions over how to respond also said the apology meant it could push back at any wider criticisms of its journalism of the US in relation to the coverage of Trump. A US congressional committee found that Trump failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol.

Should Trump pursue legal action, the BBC leadership faces an invidious choice over a public battle with the US president or making a payment that will be seen as politically toxic, given it is publicly funded through the licence fee.

The BBC does have insurance covering legal challenges to its journalism. However, insiders acknowledge that there is always a pressure on legal costs should litigation stretch on for months.

Trump has doubled down on his legal threat, stating he felt he had “an obligation” to sue the BBC. “I guess I have to,” he told Fox News. “They defrauded the public and they’ve admitted it. This is within one of our great allies, supposedly our great ally.”

He added: “They showed me the results of how they butchered it up. It was very dishonest and the head man quit and a lot of the other people quit.”

Legal experts have questioned the Trump team’s chances of victory in any court case, given Florida’s liberal libel laws and the fact the Panorama episode was not available in the state. The broadcast was too long ago to take legal action in the UK. Trump would also have to prove he was damaged by the programme.

Trump has regularly been using lawsuits to attack criticism in the media, with several major networks opting to settle claims with one eye on their commercial interests. Trump also has outstanding cases against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The edit was one of the criticisms of the BBC raised in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in the summer.

There is anger within the BBC over the Trump edit. However, there is also concern over the political nature of the Prescott memo, which outlines a series of claims of liberal bias relating to issues emerging over several years. The BBC has said some of the issues are historical, while serious action has already been taken in relation to others.

Prescott has said he had no political motivations in raising his concerns.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/522a9d0a43d2ebc69afdb305e1a5a526931c4393/0_1855_3884_3109/master/3884.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=278abddad0b89b1097143bace9cb5885",N,,2025-11-12 14:57:33.504469

""There will be nothing for me to do if arrests made during this Operation Midway Blitz are within the decree,"" Cummings said.","A federal judge has ordered that hundreds of people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be released from federal facilities in the next week because their arrests by ICE were possibly unlawful and in violation of a federal court order.

Attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU of Illinois say federal agents have arrested thousands of people in Chicago and Illinois during Operation Midway Blitz without a warrant or probable cause.

Immigration advocates argue federal agents violated a court order issued in 2022. The Castañon Nava Consent Decree limits ICE from making arrests simply out of fear that a suspect might escape before a warrant can be obtained.

On Oct. 8, a federal court ruled to extend the consent decree until at least Feb. 2, 2026. In that ruling, the judge said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE have violated the decree repeatedly, and improperly told field offices over the summer the consent decree had been canceled when it had not.

At a Wednesday hearing, the U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings issued several orders that could possibly lead to the release of thousands of people in the comings weeks.

First, Cummings ordered that 13 people identified by the plaintiffs as being unlawfully detained, and which the government conceded were in violation of the consent decree, be released from detention by Friday. Attorneys said after court they are hopeful these 13 will be released from custody within the next 48 hours, if not today. They will be released without bond.

Second, Cummings ordered a group of 615 people detained by ICE between June 2 and Oct. 7 be released into the agency's Alternatives to Detention programs by next Friday, Nov. 21, on $1,500 bond while their immigration cases are pending.

Attorneys for the detainees said they are concerned that some of the people who are now subject to release have either self-deported or been deported by the government, and said that could comprise several hundred people. The exact number of people who have now been ordered released who are still in detention facilities is not yet known.

Judge Cummings also ordered the government to produce a list of all people who have been detained both by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents — thought to be more than 3,000 people — through the present day by next Wednesday, Nov. 19. That list must include information, including names, countries of origin, arrest date and a risk assessment.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they will then go through the list to identify more people wrongfully arrested without warrants and probable cause and argue for their release from custody as well.

""I think it will show that this whole operation, for the last two months, the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, the brutalizing of people here, has all been unlawful. That's what it's going to show,"" said Mark Fleming, attorney for the National Immigration Justice Center. ""It's going to show that all of this — all of the tactics of Mr. Bovino, all of the tactics of ICE — have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests. That's what it's gonna show. So if they plan to come back, now they'll have to abide by these court orders going forward and they cannot do their enforcement in this way.""

The government will also identify people on the list who they believe are risks to public safety or flight risk, and argue for them remaining in detention. The judge said he will honor those requests as long as the list does not seem egregious. The government has already identified 12 people of the 615 ruled on today who they say are public safety or flight risks.

The judge also said that anyone released into ATD programs who is officially found to have been arrested in violation of the consent decree will have their bond refunded and will be considered completely released from immigration custody. Those in the ATD programs are still considered to be in custody, they are just not physically detained and must continue to appear for immigration check-ins and court hearings.

""This court does not sit in a position of making any policy for the government,"" Judge Cummings said as he ruled.

Instead, he said, his position is to ensure the consent decree is enforced.

""There will be nothing for me to do if arrests made during this Operation Midway Blitz are within the decree,"" Cummings said.

Victoria Sorocean was arrested on November 4 in Los Angeles after allegedly fleeing to the United States to evade a 17-year prison sentence in Europe.

She and an unnamed accomplice were convicted for allegedly beating a “victim with a stick and electrical cable before throwing the victim out of a ninth-floor window,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.

A statement issued by the DHS claimed that Sorocean was first arrested on January 10, 2020. After filing multiple appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals, she was eventually released in 2022.

“It shocks the conscience that the Biden Administration released into America a cruel, violent illegal alien who tortured a human being, beat them with an electrical cable and a stick, and then threw her victim from a ninth-floor window,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an official statement. “These are the types of barbaric criminal illegal aliens ICE is targeting every single day.

“70% of all ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. This does not even include foreign fugitives like this convicted murderer.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the world’s criminals are no longer welcome in the U.S.”

The DHS released a picture of the Moldovan national in the backseat of a car. Sorocean can be seen in the photograph with her blonde hair tied back, as she clutches a water bottle and waits in the back of an ICE vehicle.

In her home country, she was convicted of intentional murder in 2013 and was set to be jailed for 17 years. Currently, Sorocean remains in ICE custody according to the DHS statement.

The arrest comes as the second Trump Administration pushes ahead with its controversial, hardline deportation program.

During an interview on the CBS News show 60 Minutes, Trump claimed that ICE raids “haven’t gone far enough,” despite a recent report from Politico finding that more than 100 federal judges have ruled against the massive deportation scheme.

The White House previously reported that it was on track to smash deportation records this year, after removing more than 515,000 people from the country. The administration has claimed that over 1.6 million undocumented people have self-deported this year.

However, Aaron Reichlin Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, has said that “these numbers are NOT trustworthy.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/12/13/01/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-13-08-35.png?trim=0,10,0,9&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-12 16:57:00.235960

""This staff member allegedly did so to gain access to the detainee and seek his release from custody, and he accomplished it by falsifying an official Department of Homeland Security (DHS) form.""

While at the facility, York successfully met with Ayuzo and got him to sign a G-28 form, the letter said. It allows an attorney to represent a client on immigration matters, empowering them to receive official correspondence, communicate with government agencies on their behalf and more.

After attaining a release order, the staffer then tried to submit the form without Sandoval’s signature, even after having completed the G-28 form in person, the letter said.

""Four days later, a Suarez Law Office in Collinsville, Illinois filed a G-28 electronically that did not have Mr. Ayuzo’s signature, even though Mr. York, who claimed to work for the law firm, had already obtained a signed form,"" the letter describes.

""It appears as if Mr. York may have collaborated with the firm to cover his misrepresentation.""

ICE said it could not verify that York was an attorney.

The agency further became suspicious of the picture when they discovered a post to Facebook describing the incident. The post, put up by the Montgomery County Illinois Democrats’ page, described that a staffer had gone to a field office with a packet of documents and a release order with the intention of misrepresenting himself to law enforcement, the letter said.

Lyons' letter requests a response from Duckworth’s office no later than Nov. 17, demanding answers surrounding York’s employment, whether he knowingly lied on government documents, and whether he acted with the knowledge of other members of Duckworth’s staff.

Smith also sought the records of Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), but as a House member, he would not benefit from the bill.
This provision would not give any Americans other than U. S. Senators these rights,” Raskin wrote.
“If we believe that citizens should receive notice when the government subpoenas their phone bill, great!","The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee slammed a Senate-approved plan to reopen the government that would also pave the way for eight GOP senators to earn significant sums from litigation challenging the search of their phone records related to Jan. 6.

Tucked into the GOP proposal, which eight Democratic senators also approved, the bill requires telecommunications companies to alert senators if their data has been obtained. But it also allows those whose phone records were seized as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation to earn substantial sums from legal challenges stemming from the matter.

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) called the provision “one of the most blatantly corrupt provisions for political self-dealing and the plunder of public resources ever proposed in Congress.”

The provision, which is retroactive to 2022, only applies to members of the Senate and would allow them to sue for $500,000 if data was sought without their being notified, as well as once it was obtained.

“That’s a cool one million per Senator,” Raskin said in a statement.

“There was no ‘phone tap’ or eavesdropping on the content of their conversations. The call records subpoenaed were the kind of information you see on a phone bill—a list of calls made and received,” he said, adding that the eight senators were “pathetically casting themselves as victims.”

Smith sought the phone records of eight senators as well as one member of the House during his investigation into Jan. 6, including those known to have spoken to President Trump during the riot at the Capitol.

Information recently released by Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shows Smith subpoenaed the phone records of eight of his GOP colleagues: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.).

Smith also sought the records of Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), but as a House member, he would not benefit from the bill.

Raskin said it would be inappropriate for lawmakers to earn a payday from routine law enforcement action.

“The Senators may not like being treated like the rest of America, but these phone-record subpoenas and non-disclosure orders are routine in grand jury investigations at the state and federal level. No one has an absolute right to be notified that their call records have been subpoenaed, much less the right to a million bucks if it happens. This provision would not give any Americans other than U. S. Senators these rights,” Raskin wrote.

“If we believe that citizens should receive notice when the government subpoenas their phone bill, great! Perhaps this revolutionary new policy—which civil liberties groups would probably support—should be the law. But then the law should protect the civil liberties of all 320 million Americans, as the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution demands, not just the 100 Americans in the Senate.”

The legislation does include some caveats. The Justice Department would not be required to alert a senator that their records were sought if the lawmaker was the target of the investigation, allowing a federal judge to delay any such notification requirements.

The legislation comes as Trump has also sought compensation from the Justice Department related to his own legal troubles, asking for a $230 million settlement related to the investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller and from Smith’s classified documents probe.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/raskinjamie_093025gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-12 13:57:32.990908

In interviews, a man detained at Pine Prairie through June and a legal consultant for another man held there this summer described a crowded facility with scarce resources — men sleeping on floors due to an alleged lack of beds inside packed dormitories; detainees wearing the same uniforms for several days because they weren’t given a change of clothing (not even underwear), pleading with staff for hygiene products to keep themselves clean and denied access to medical care and other services.

“These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life,” said Alexandra Smolyar, an attorney at Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice who consulted with the man detained at Pine Prairie over the Summer.

Pine Prairie, which is run by the private prison corporation the GEO Group, has a contract with ICE that calls for a maximum daily population of 500. But it has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees since as early as mid-April, according to information from data research organization Transactional Records Access Clearing House (TRAC) at Syracuse University, or TRAC. While ICE reported that Pine Prairie had an average daily population of 788 on September 15, the most recent date for which a count is available, TRAC researchers have calculated the average population at that time at 915 people.

Since President Trump was sworn in for his second term — promising an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants, no matter whether they have criminal records or are considered dangerous — the number of people being held in immigration detention has skyrocketed by 69%, from just over 39,000 in December to about 66,000 today.

Complaints from immigrant rights advocates about poor conditions inside detention centers are not uncommon. In 2020 and 2021, federal oversight bodies received several complaints from advocates about lack of hygiene products and personal protective equipment inside Louisiana’s immigration detention facilities, including Pine Prairie, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As that detained population has grown in 2025, media reports and advocates have described cramped quarters where living conditions have gone from bad under the Biden Administration, to much worse under Trump.

Advocates told Verite News that Pine Prairie is a case in point. They said capacity issues are leading to worsening conditions at the facility, which already had a long history of complaints alleging human rights abuses and civil rights violations.

“This year it feels much worse,” said Tania Wolf, an advocacy manager at the National Immigration Project, who has gone on frequent visits to ICE detention centers in Louisiana. “It feels like things are getting to a point where things are gonna boil over in terms of conditions.”

A ‘horrible pressure point’

Lenin, a Honduran citizen who was detained at Pine Prairie from October 2024 until he was deported in June, said in an interview last week that conditions at the facility were poor during the entirety of his stay. Lenin, who said he fled his birth country in 2015 after MS-13 gang members allegedly killed a close relative and threatened to kill him, asked Verite News to publish only his middle name because he fears for his safety since he has returned to Honduras.

Lenin said when he first arrived at Pine Prairie he was placed in a crowded dorm where some men slept on the floor. He said that he and other detainees had been given only one pair of underwear and one uniform, leaving them with no way of changing into clean clothes for days. They had difficulty getting hygiene items, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste and at times even toilet paper, Lenin said. The dorm was kept cold and staff would not respond to detainees’ requests to increase the temperature, he alleged, adding that staff often denied him visits to the medical unit to receive medication or treatment for anxiety and depression.

“They don’t treat us like humans,” Lenin said. “If you don’t speak English, you can’t have anything,”

In late July and in early August, attorney Alexandra Smolyar, at the Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sent emails to immigrant rights lawyers who work in Louisiana, including Wolf, alleging “absolutely abysmal” conditions inside Pine Prairie, relayed to her by a detainee with whom she had consulted.

The details laid out in her emails are similar to the conditions that Lenin described — inadequate clothing leading to detainees wearing the same clothes for days on end, guards shouting and using profanity when speaking to detainees, staff skipping nightly pill calls causing people to miss medications, detainees getting the wrong medication.

“Overcrowding is growing more dire by the day; medical care is severely lacking; there’s no access to a law library or mail,” she wrote in an August email. “The conditions are really harrowing.”

In a September interview, Smolyar said the Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, who has since been deported, described to her a packed intake area for people initially booked into the facility with one shower, one toilet and one sink and detainees sleeping on bare mattresses set on the floor of a holding cell. (Smolyar declined to identify the former Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, but she said he was deported in August.)

“It epitomized how the expansion of detention is coming to this horrible, horrible pressure point where people’s lives are in jeopardy every day,” Smolyar said.

Wolf said she had already become concerned about overcrowding at Pine Prairie in July, when she attended a standard tour of the detention center.

Wolf said she and others on the tour — which was approved by ICE officials — repeatedly asked staff and accompanying ICE agents for a count of detainees booked into the facility that day. In her notes, Wolf wrote that the group was never given a population count. The omission, she said, was very unusual.

When the tour got to the visitation area — a space where detainees often meet with attorneys — Wolf said it looked more run down than in previous visits she’d made to Pine Prairie.

“It just looked a little bit more — for lack of a better term — lived in,” Wolf said.

Wolf said detainees later told her that some of them had been sleeping in the visitation unit due to overcrowding. In a phone interview this week, Wolf said she’d never heard of a facility making detainees sleep in its visitation area before then.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the GEO Group, the company that operates Pine Prairie, denied claims of worsening living conditions at the facility.

“GEO strongly rejects these baseless claims, which are preposterous and bizarre,” wrote GEO Group Director of Corporate Relations Christopher Ferreira. “The Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center provides high quality support services that adhere to ICE’s detention standards and contract requirements, which provide for ample access to pre-scheduled recreation opportunities both indoors and outdoors. Individuals at the Center are in no way deprived of natural light nor are they subjected to excessive artificial light.”

In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Tamara Spicer, did not answer specific questions about conditions at Pine Prairie but said the agency is experiencing “unprecedented operational demands” due to “recent unlawful border crossings.”

“ICE has appropriately intensified enforcement operations to restore integrity to the system,” Spicer said. “The volume of apprehensions is not the result of ICE policy but the direct result of individuals choosing to break the law. ICE will not apologize for enforcing U.S. law.”

Problems with ICE’s average daily population figures

ICE provides bimonthly reports with “snapshots” of the total number of detainees in its custody in each state and overall. But, for individual facilities, the agency only reports the average daily population — pooling numbers from the start of the fiscal year (October 1) through the present day. The result is a skewed perception of how many people are detained at a facility at any given time.

In April, ICE reported that Pine Prairie detained an average of 689 people — though ICE records show the population reached as high as 923 on April 13, a number obtained by TRAC through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Data researchers have responded to the lack of consistent data on daily population counts by creating a new method to calculate the average daily populations that they say provides more accurate results for how many people are currently (or have recently been) detained at a facility. To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.

Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities. According to the site, on Sept. 2, Pine Prairie’s interval daily population was 1,010 detainees, more than double its contractual capacity and 233 people and more than ICE’s reported average population for the same day of 783 people.

Overcrowding in ICE facilities began making headlines in March, when images and video from inside Krome detention center in Miami showed detainees sleeping on floors with cardboard boxes for makeshift mattresses.

According to data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by researchers at TRAC, nearly half of all ICE facilities in the country were housing more detainees than their contracts with ICE allowed as early as April.

That data showed two other Louisiana facilities, Richwood Correctional Center and Winn Correctional Center, run by private prison company LaSalle Corrections, were operating over their contractual capacities by several dozen detainees.

LaSalle Corrections did not respond to emailed requests for comment on its facilities’ operating over capacity.

Backed up

Wolf said that on the tour at Pine Prairie, staff referred to the detention center as an “overflow” facility for ICE’s staging facility in Alexandria that sits on the tarmac of an international airport that is the Department of Homeland Security’s main deportation hub. Considered the final stop for many migrants before they are removed from the U.S., the staging facility is supposed to hold detainees for 72-hours or less, while ICE prepares for their deportation flights. However, in September, the Guardian reported that many detainees are being held at Alexandria for longer than three days.

“For the system to work … the people who are going to be funneled into the staging facility need to be somewhere else in the weeks preceding,” said Norah Ahmed, legal director at ACLU of Louisiana.

According to Ahmed, Pine Prairie appears to be operating as a pre-staging facility — holding detainees with orders of deportation who may have exhausted their options for legal ways to remain in the country while their deportation flights are being prepared. She said when flights don’t take off as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances, such as negotiation breakdowns between the U.S. and countries accepting deportees, sometimes people get returned to Pine Prairie after it has already accepted new residents to take their place, contributing to overcrowding.

Lenin spent roughly nine months at Pine Prairie. As the facility was growing more crowded, Lenin said, he was in solitary confinement. He said staff told him it was for his own safety after a confrontation with other detainees. He said he told staff members that isolation, inside a small room with no windows to the outside world and where the hallway lights were kept on continuously, might exacerbate his anxiety and depression. But he remained in segregation, he said until his deportation in June.

Smolyar, who works mainly with people detained in Georgia, said she fears that, in the months since the detainee she was consulting with at Pine Prairie was deported, things have gotten worse.

“We’re seeing incredibly high numbers of people being detained. They’re being pushed to a breaking point,” Smolyar said. “These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life.”

The plans are preliminary and could change, the sources told ABC News. It is unclear if they would run at the same time or one city would go first.

Bovino has become the on-the-ground face of President Donald Trump's effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless whether local official want them there -- First in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.

The sheriff's office ""has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.

In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, ""We aren't leaving Chicago,"" and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began.

The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally called out by a federal judge.

US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.

""Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,"" Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a preliminary injunction blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, ""unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.""

That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is appealing the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be delayed while an appeals court panel considers the case.

The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were ""violent rioters and assaultive subjects.""

Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a ""reportable use of force"" because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.

Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. ""In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,"" she said.

Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was ""making a determination.""

""Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?"" he said.

Bivens itself was born of judicial fiction—a way for people to seek damages in federal court without a legislated remedy.
When it created the Bivens remedy, the Supreme Court strongly suggested it would be narrow.","In the wake of the Chicago South Shore raid—which reportedly saw masked U.S. agents rappelling down from a Black Hawk helicopter, bursting into a 130-unit building, kicking down doors, zip-tying and holding American citizens at gunpoint, and the detention of 37 Venezuelan nationals—a law school classmate asked me: Why isn’t every one of these raids—where officers trash property and terrorize residents—a potential Bivens case?

The answer, chilling, at least to me, is: Because my team and I spent decades at the Department of Justice making sure that such lawsuits would be dismissed, typically without trial, and often even without discovery.

For half a century, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents has been hailed as the primary safeguard against unconstitutional actions by federal officers. Bivens permitted victims of these actions to seek money damages from individual federal officers directly under the Constitution. These actions are often analogized to the far more common “Section 1983” claims available against state and local officials under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. But accountability under Bivens is far more constrained than many lawyers might assume. Certainly, if you ask the general public whether they think there is a way to file a civil suit and receive compensation—whether from individual officers or the United States more broadly—for constitutional violations such as excessive or deadly force by federal actors, the general belief is: of course. Yet constitutional violations hardly ever result in the payment of damages. The reality is the behemoth that was Bivens now no longer serves victims of constitutional harms, the federal workforce as a whole, individual officers in particular, or society at large. Those in the United States must look somewhere else for recompense, deterrence, settled litigation expectations, and institutional and jurisprudential order.

Here’s why.

In October, a certiorari petition was filed in Nielsen v. Watanabe—a case concerning a federal inmate (Kekai Watanabe) who suffered a fractured coccyx in a prison gang fight, causing chronic pain, but was not sent to the hospital. (Wantanabe’s counsel was granted an extension of time to respond until Jan. 5, 2026.) Buried at the end, the petitioner mused that the Supreme Court “may wish to consider whether it should dispense with Bivens altogether.”

To be clear, for many of the reasons petitioner raises, the case presented an exceedingly poor vehicle for individual-capacity remedy under any construction. Any failure in Watanabe’s medical treatment was likely institutional—in my three decades at Justice, I never encountered a scenario where a lengthy delay in carceral care was the product of malfeasance by an individual or rogue official. Certainly, only the United States could come close to satisfying the $3 million in damages sought by Watanabe. Nonetheless, a split panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court’s decision to dismiss the Bivens claim. And although rehearing and rehearing en banc were subsequently denied, permitting the Bivens claim to proceed, 11 judges dissented from that decision

On behalf of the Nielsen petitioner, Jeffrey Lamken and his colleagues correctly argue that under current Supreme Court precedent, the Ninth Circuit’s decision is flatly wrong. Lamken, former assistant to the solicitor general and frequent Supreme Court participant, is himself no stranger to Bivens litigation, having successfully argued Hasty/Ziglar v. Abbasi, a landmark 2017 Supreme Court Bivens case arising out of the post-9/11 era. (I worked on that case as well.) In light of Supreme Court decision after decision cutting back on Bivens, even in arenas that arguably on their face involve routine law enforcement operations, lower courts across the country continue to struggle to understand the question: What if anything is “left” of Bivens? To be fair to the judges in the panel majority in Nielsen, the Supreme Court has made it exceedingly difficult for lower courts to apply Bivens in the first instance, at least if they are to assume in good faith that there is anything left of implied constitutional tort remedies at all.

The Nielsen certiorari petition does a more than creditable job explaining (under every criterion imaginable) why the Supreme Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit. It soft-sells the revisit Bivens question itself, presumably because the attorneys who wrote it felt they owed it to their client to do so. But reversing the Ninth Circuit decision, and not Bivens itself, would simply perpetuate the immense problems surrounding the entire implied constitutional tort doctrine in the first instance—creating problems for judges, problems for litigants on all sides and across every gradient on the ideological spectrum, and problems for institutional and jurisprudential order.

The Court can—and legally should—reverse Bivens. The sooner the better.

When Bivens Had Teeth

When I joined the Justice Department in 1990, Bivens offered a modest but meaningful check on federal power. The Supreme Court had recognized that a citizen whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated by federal officers entering their home without a warrant could seek damages directly under the Constitution. Bivens itself was born of judicial fiction—a way for people to seek damages in federal court without a legislated remedy. The United States couldn’t be sued directly because of sovereign immunity. And while the United States might be sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for certain common law torts, such as negligence or a car accident where an on-duty federal employee was at fault and a private person would be liable under state law—those didn’t typically have the breadth or gravitas of a constitutional claim. As the Bivens Court itself noted, “the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” The FTCA, and its pre-suit administrative remedies, can provide meaningful tort recovery. Its waiver, however, contains substantial limitations when compared against traditional civil litigation: It does not provide for punitive damages; cases are tried to a judge, not a jury; and a number of exceptions apply to exclude liability for particular torts, such as for malicious prosecution by prosecutors, or more significantly the discretionary function exception, are often a substantial barrier to recovery.

Despite the potential for some overlapping recovery for common law claims under the FTCA, Bivens and its early progeny allowed plaintiffs to recover damages from individual federal officers directly for constitutional torts. When it created the Bivens remedy, the Supreme Court strongly suggested it would be narrow. Justice John Marshall Harlan’s concurrence famously intoned, “For people in Bivens’ shoes, it is damages or nothing.” At that time, courts generally considered Bivens confined to narrow search and seizure contexts, a limitation that made practical sense. Potential Fourth Amendment violations tend to be the most “hands on.” Due to the dangerous and rapidly unfolding circumstances in which they often occur, unreasonable searches and seizures risk death and serious injury in a way that could not be remedied through traditional forms of equitable relief or other post-deprivation processes. And at least in the days before cell phones or body cams, they often occurred beyond the public eye. This all paved the way for lawsuits that were essentially high-stakes swearing matches. Unscrupulous plaintiffs (or unscrupulous officers) could perjure their way to a jury (or out of accountability) and hope for the best. Such litigation imposed heavy and at times unpredictable litigation burdens on both the parties and the courts.

Over time, with the Supreme Court’s imprimatur, the reach of Bivens grew—in 1979 to Fifth Amendment substantive due process claims for gender discrimination and in 1980, to Eighth Amendment failure to provide medical care to a federal prisoner having an acute asthma attack, causing his death.

Over the years, lower courts extended it further—to procedural due process, First Amendment expression, retaliation, and religion claims, and beyond. Eventually, nearly every conceivable action by the federal government with some constitutional hook, regardless of context, became a feeding ground for litigation against federal employees personally. And systemic litigation burdens grew accordingly.

I represented—or advised on the representation of—clients of all ranks, from all agencies, and across administrations and ideologies. Over the years, every sort of federal employee became a Bivens defendant: Janet Reno, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft, John Yoo, Stephen Miller, William Barr, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump. Admirals and generals. Drone operators, line-level FBI and ICE agents, prison wardens, chaplains, and guards. The list goes on. Judges eager to vindicate constitutional rights assumed that if there were an alleged wrong, there must be a personal-capacity remedy, even though Congress never created the federal equivalent to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (the aforementioned Section 1983 claims).

Such an expansive view of Bivens chilled decision-making, making federal service a calculated risk. Imagine every policy decision inviting suit against a cabinet secretary and those carrying out policy mandates? Yet decades of Bivens litigation proceeded on that assumption. For line federal employees and their families, the costs of Bivens were stark and personal. Few if any expected to be sued for doing their jobs. But process servers appeared at their homes. Their assets, even their children’s education, were at stake. Many faced reputational damage and years, even decades, of litigation. Even mere exposure to suit forced disclosure on mortgage or other applications—essentially a scarlet letter for doing your job. Meritless suits—from pro se litigants or claimants with a political ax to grind—were common.

Still today, federal employees aren’t even guaranteed Justice Department representation—those decisions remain discretionary. And federal officials have never had an entitlement to indemnification. Each individual federal agency determines when, if ever, it will indemnify its officers. For instance, for Justice Department officers, such as FBI agents, indemnification is discretionary; the department “may” indemnify where it is in the United States’s interests to do so, and pre-judgment indemnification (for example, settlement) is prohibited absent “exceptional circumstances.” These discretionary administrative determinations are generally unreviewable by courts.

State or local officials, by contrast (and precisely because of the potential reach of Section 1983 liability), tend in most circumstances to benefit from automatic representation and guaranteed indemnification. With respect to the balance to be struck between having the federal government waive its liability for constitutional torts and preserving Bivens suits against individuals, Congress debated various proposals. Congress ultimately passed the Westfall Act in 1988—excluding constitutional torts from the exclusivity provisions that apply to common law torts under the FTCA (which can proceed against only the government and not the individual). In this process, some civil rights advocates, perhaps hoping for big jury awards akin to Section 1983 in Bivens actions, and worried about other limits on the United States’s FTCA liability, opposed broad immunity for federal employees and the substitution of the United States in their shoes. But even in its headiest days, Bivens was a sorry substitute for Section 1983, other forms of tort liability such as the FTCA, or any real make-whole relief. There was no entity liability and no attorneys’ fees for substantially prevailing, and individual indemnification was limited or nonexistent.

Meanwhile, courts and litigants expended enormous resources parsing Bivens’s boundaries without legislative guidance and in the face of a vacillating Supreme Court. Jury verdicts, the handful of times they happened, almost never converted to real recovery. Agents lacked resources, and, still, indemnification was not guaranteed. Moreover (as with civil rights claims under Section 1983), even with a jury verdict in hand, qualified immunity—barring recovery even where a constitutional violation occurred if the officer did not violate “clearly established” law—could intervene on appeal when the question was a legal one for the court, not the jury. Bivens’s claws cut deep.

Caging the Beast: Special Factors Doctrine

At the Justice Department, I was one of the principal architects of what became known as the “special factors” doctrine. This judicially created exception to Bivens was first applied modestly by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Schweiker v. Chilicky, a case in which plaintiffs’ Social Security disability benefits were wrongfully withheld. Though the benefits themselves had been reinstated, the plaintiffs sued under Bivens for emotional distress and other damages for the period they were denied. Relying on a line in Bivens itself, the Court refused to recognize a remedy given “special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.”

For nearly 10 years, while Chilicky was on the books, “special factors” went nowhere. It was certainly not the term of art it is today. When I first proposed the argument that “special factors” should bar a constitutional tort suit—in a case involving Agriculture Department officials in Arkansas accused of racial discrimination in distributing farm subsidies—my bosses were more than a little skeptical.

But we ran with it—and won, both in district court and at the Eighth Circuit.

For a young attorney, convinced of the argument’s legal soundness, and determined to vindicate her clients, that victory was elemental. Areas in which we made the argument began to expand (due primarily to the expansion of contexts in which plaintiffs began to pursue cases against federal officers). The governmental response, many would say over-response, to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks proved groundbreaking. Civil rights litigators sought to remedy every infirmity in the United States’s response to 9/11—including those most appropriately addressed through political processes—through Bivens. In the early days we lost some cases, cases clearly inappropriate for ad hoc, judge-made law. But eventually the sense in the arguments began to take hold and courts listened. And brick by brick, case by case, we caged Bivens, limiting it to a handful of contexts.

Many folks, even some within the Justice Department, understandably questioned the bona fides of pushing the bounds of special factors. Didn’t its logical extension mean nothing was left of Bivens? And how did that square with Supreme Court precedent and stare decisis? Over time, though, that is exactly where the Supreme Court moved, increasingly recognizing limits on Bivens, including separation-of-powers considerations, national and border security, alternative processes, and policy discretion.

So, what’s the takeaway for anyone—including U.S. citizens—injured in that Chicago immigration raid? Based on a trinity of more recent Supreme Court rulings, the Court has green-lighted the argument that no damages remedy exists. In Ziglar v. Abbasi, the Court rejected a Bivens remedy to challenge confinement conditions, including strip searches and abuse claims, on detainees in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. In Hernandez v. Mesa, the Court held there was no damages remedy for the use of deadly force by a border patrol agent standing in the United States that resulted in the death of a teenager on the Mexican side of the border. And in Egbert v. Boule, the Court refused to extend an implied remedy against a border patrol agent for excessive force and First Amendment retaliation claims by a U.S. citizen operating a business near a port of entry along the Canadian border. The Court’s “test,” on whether to imply a constitutional tort remedy, now boils down to a single question: Is there any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy? The practical consequence is that lower courts’ attempts to expand Bivens are no longer good law, and it is unclear whether even the narrow categories in which the Supreme Court recognized a remedy, including Bivens itself, would survive scrutiny under the modern analysis. As the Nielsen petition notes, Bivens is a “zombie,” dead on arrival in all but a scant handful of cases (of which, at the end of the day, and however the Supreme Court manages it, Nielsen is unlikely to be one).

When False Judicial Promise Meets Fading Executive Accountability

Perhaps that is as it should be. Congress never created a cause of action, and courts have long proved ill-suited to fashion one. Bivens was, from the start, a judicial workaround and, as it turns out, not an especially effective one, regardless of whose perspective is being considered: civil rights plaintiffs, civil rights defendants, or the bench. Bivens is a false promise of the very worst sort.

Moreover, as the Court has reminded us in declining to recognize Bivens remedies, there have traditionally been other checks on federal misconduct: inspectors general, internal investigations, and—where warranted—criminal prosecutions. Federal actors are more visible, more supervised, and more accountable than local law enforcement. They have traditionally been better trained and more rigorously screened, and bad behavior has traditionally been met with stern executive and congressional oversight.

When the horrors of Abu Ghraib—another failed Bivens context—surfaced, Congress intervened swiftly to prohibit waterboarding and limit interrogation practices. Congress has at other times acted when tort systems prove unworkable or ill-suited to address injuries that fairness and public opinion demand be remedied: Consider the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. These measures—including several recent amendments and extensions—illustrate that with enough motivation, Congress can design targeted tort and quasi-tort remedies that balance victim interests, public accountability and institutional stability all while insulating putative defendants who carry out vital federal functions.

But what happens when the internal checks and balances are removed? When the public doesn't trust federal officials to investigate wrongdoing and ensure accountability? When Congress abdicates oversight? When the government lowers its standards, cuts training, and sends poorly prepared agents into communities as ad hoc police? What happens when officers deploy in masks without badges, when their actions are shielded from scrutiny, and complaints can’t even be filed? When the United States fires career Justice Department prosecutors and enlists self-styled “patriots” to mete out “justice”?

That’s neither hyperbole nor hypothetical.

By executive order, on the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, the Biden administration established the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD), a central repository documenting instances of misconduct as well as commendations and awards for law enforcement officers. It was designed to strengthen hiring practices and increase transparency and accountability. While not without its challenges and critics, the NLEAD was regarded as a positive step by a diverse coalition of federal agencies and advocacy and human rights organizations. On the day of his inauguration, however, President Trump rescinded Biden’s order.

With no civil liability (for officers or the entity), with weakening internal oversight, and in the face of congressional silence, the United States now effectively has a system where federal power is nearly immune from accountability in any form other than political—and where the institutional checks meant to replace it are failing in real time.

Should Bivens, or Some Comparable Creature of Personal Liability, Be Unleashed?

Maybe so, some say. James E. Pfander and Rex N. Alley, for example, put forth the restoration of common law intentional tort claims against individual federal officers as worth considering. The answer to this question is certainly not open and shut: There is some intuitive appeal to the notion that a weak Bivens is better than no Bivens at all. What is clear is that the current Court has zero interest in resurrecting Bivens, and a majority has been happy to write it out of existence altogether.

Is it true that without individual-capacity liability, there is no genuine individual deterrence for bad conduct? While reasonable minds can differ, in a system with robust checks and balances, that’s not my experience. In my three decades at the Department of Justice, I examined the conduct of federal officials in every conceivable factual scenario to determine whether or not federal representation would be authorized in their Bivens suits. I advised the alphabet soup of federal agencies about constitutional practices and directly represented and oversaw the representation of hundreds upon hundreds of clients in individual cases. I can count on one hand the number of times some truly rogue federal officer violated the Constitution. And news flash: Truly bad actors aren’t modifying their conduct because they think they might be tagged with Bivens liability!

Federal officers who are well screened, hired, and trained, including those in the immigration, law enforcement, and carceral settings, are—almost down to a person—hardworking, dedicated, competent folks. They may occasionally make mistakes, but they try their best to carry out their mission of public trust, especially where internal checks, balances, and recognition for doing a good job are robust. Again in my experience—and my former office considered almost every Bivens case filed throughout the country for purposes of determining federal represetation—in the rare case where a federal constitutional violation occurred, it was almost always because of a decision by higher-up policymakers in exceedingly difficult times who because of time or other factors did not necessarily understand the operational nuances involved, or where an agency culture lacking accountability and internal checks and balances prevailed.

Regardless, without a legislative remedy, any Bivens-type liability will fall prey to the same slings and arrows that cut it down this time around. The systemic costs of courts trying to reinvent Bivens (or its doppelganger), its unpredictable litigation burdens, and its failure to provide a meaningful remedy even at the best of times “counsel against” resurrecting it. But they also counsel against the status quo, that is, the Supreme Court continuing to gnaw at Bivens’s edges without grappling with its fundamental problems.

If the Supreme Court grants certiorari in Nielsen (as legally it should)—it should not simply write around the core problems of the 1971 relic. Rather it should call out Bivens’s false promise and reverse it. Overruling Bivens would preserve constitutional separation-of-powers and improve institutional order. Any “rule of law” it now represents, moreover, fails completely to protect the litigation expectations of either plaintiffs or defendants. If Bivens is left on the books, judicial integrity is threatened as lower courts struggle to assume a remedy that Supreme Court logic precludes. And absent that step, there is little incentive for Congress to craft or amend thoughtful, context-specific accountability measures.

When federal hands violate the Constitution, it makes good sense for the government itself—not some random officer—to pay the price. And not simply the political price—the actual taxpayer dollars-and-cents cost of government abuse. No lone federal agent could possibly remedy any unconstitutional conduct at the South Street Apartments, or anywhere else federal agents may “run amok.” With respect to Chicago, at least some members of Congress seem to have an appetite for oversight. And when government abuse escalates without accountability, or where government programs result in individual harms, history (such as Abu Ghraib, like radiation exposure from nuclear testing, like the passage of the Vaccine Act, or the FTCA itself) suggests that public outcry can fuel actual congressional oversight.

If the Supreme Court closes the Bivens gate permanently, as it can do in Nielsen, it may open the door for Congress to consider principled, reliable legislative options. The easiest fix, and the one most palatable to diverse equity holders, may be a simple adjustment to provide FTCA-type liability for constitutional torts. That’s obviously not the only option. Again, some observers suggest looking back to the past to try and restore individual liability as a matter of common law. Others argue for broadening Section 1983 to include federal conduct. Others, like myself, favor various ways to broaden the FTCA. When Congress gets to the point of discussing legislative options, there no doubt will be vigorous debate.

This much is clear: Bivens is serving no one, and the fix is long overdue.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/cbp-agent-(1)484cdf74-bf59-4bc6-92bf-80fda450f3bd.jpg?sfvrsn=1edd4d89_3,N,,2025-11-12 12:56:56.603070

Coakley will serve as the president of the Conference for three years — encompassing the remainder of Trump's presidency.

Over the past three years, Coakley served as the secretary for the Conference. He is known as being a more outspoken Catholic conservative, emphasizing his strong opposition to abortion and the death penalty. He praised Oklahoma for enacting a near total abortion ban in 2021. And just two days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, Coakley issued a statement urging for Catholics to be mindful of the plight of the migrant as ""the conversation concerning 'mass deportation' takes hold.

A third of the Catholic Church is Hispanic, and Trump's deportation policies have created a chilling effect on migrants' mass attendance as they fear detainment.

""As our nation struggles to address serious and complicated issues surrounding immigration, the Church must be a leader in embracing diverse newcomers and providing assistance and pastoral care to immigrants, migrants, refugees and people on the move,"" Coakley wrote on X.

The Conference is also set to consider whether to put out a ""Special Message"" on immigration the the public. This is a rare occurrence with the last one made in 2013 condemning the mandate for companies to include contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Trump's mass deportation efforts, which have resulted in more than half a million deportations, have been the subject of sharp criticisms by the Catholic Church due to how migrants are targeted and their treatment in detainment.

Just last month, Pope Leo, a Chicago native, called the Trump administration's treatment of migrants to be ""inhuman.""

Aligned with Pope Leo's estimation of Trump's immigration policies, the Conference also wrote a letter to Leo expressing their qualms with the mass targeting of immigrants who entered the country illegally.

“As shepherds in the United States, we face a growing worldview that is so often at odds with the Gospel mandate to love thy neighbor,”the bishops wrote.

“We support secure and orderly borders and law enforcement actions in response to dangerous criminal activity, but we cannot remain silent in this challenging hour while the right to worship and the right to due process are undermined.""

But the Conference stopped short of making a formal declaration condemning the Trump administration. Vice President JD Vance is a devout Catholic who converted to the faith in 2019.

It is the standard stencil of measures taken when societal temperatures reach an uncomfortable degree in the interest of restoring order to brewing chaos. What that order is, and what apparent chaos threatens it have, historically, varied in answer and consequence—each landing on either end of the moral spectrum. Such is the nature of United States history, carved from the test and trials of human rights with each outcome shaping the image of our country in its laws, norms, and privileges. We could surmise that the positioning factor on this proposed spectrum ultimately comes down to a question of humanity: Where does the balance lie in maintaining security and upholding human rights, and at what point do we justify sacrificing our rights as citizens and as humans in the name of national security?

The very purpose of declared human rights is to remind governing powers and their legislature of our humanity. That is what the United Nations endeavored in 1948 through their “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, which consists of thirty articles that define what constitutes “universally protected rights” regardless of race, religion, sex, country of origin, et cetera (un.org Universal Declaration of Human Rights). The power of these articles exists as universal boundaries intended to protect people from government overreach and to cultivate the optimal human experience in an equitable fashion across the globe. Ideally, this intersects with national security in the shared interest of ensuring the sanctity of humanity through established agencies, legislations, or governances. The U.S. Constitution is one such example of this synergy as a living document purposed to hold accountable the comprising powers of the United States to its constituents. In recent months, this dual support has been strained and faltered in the misuse of power displayed by one of our own national security agencies: Immigration Customs and Enforcement.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are one of the many departments in the United States with the goal of safeguarding our nation’s security through a few avenues; Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) which involve human trafficking, smuggling, transnational threats, among other threats, and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) which involves the identification and removal of undocumented immigrants (ice.gov/mission). Thus far, of the thirty articles mentioned in the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, there are at least three that, by their definition, have been violated in ICE’s recent ERO activities over the past few months: Articles 3, 9, and 20. The commonality that these three articles share is their explicit safeguard against direct and deliberate maltreatment towards a person by a governing entity. Article 3 addresses this with a declared right to “life, liberty, and security of person”—which, if the first two rights sound familiar, it is because they also exist in the Declaration of Independence (un.org Universal Declaration of Rights; Declaration of Independence: A Transcription). “Security of person” is a unique term when considering its wide-ranging definition that encompasses physical protection from bodily abuse, mental protection from psychological abuse, legal protection from abuse of law and legislative oppression, and material protection from undue or arbitrary seizure of property (liberty.org Security of Person). Article 3’s widespread nature overlaps several of the articles mentioned in the “Universal Declaration,” including those mentioned in this article.

Generally, ICE’s protocols regarding use of force and restraints follow a strict “in case of emergency” criteria, where the detainee presents a danger to themselves, others, or surrounding property (2025 National Detention Standards, 44). Even then, this is solely after all attempts at communication—approaching the detainee “in a language or manner that [they] understand”—have been attempted to no avail (2025 National Detention Standards, 44). These protocols have been mishandled or bypassed altogether in recent attempts at detainment with U.S. citizens becoming a target.

Against Article 9’s prohibition of “arbitrary arrest, detention or exile”, ICE’s endowed power to detain violators of immigration law has overextended to include citizens like Amanda Trebach, who was one of many to record masked ICE agents as they detained undocumented immigrants (un.org Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’). Her actions were met with handcuffs and a seat in the back of a black van where she was detained without due process and released hours later (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’). Ms. Trebach is not alone in this situation, with one George Retes suffering the same issue after he was caught between a protest and an ICE raid (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’).

The Department of Homeland Security’s official website has issued an official statement to debunk this claim, implying that the Retes was obstructing the officers’ route and “refusing to move his vehicle” (DHS Debunks New York Times False Reporting: DHS Does NOT Deport U.S. Citizens). However, the visual timestamps of their interaction with Retes show a brief conversation happening shortly after the 50-minute mark before ICE advances. A gas cannister is deployed approximately twenty seconds after ICE begins advancing, requiring the car to reverse. At 51 minutes and 35 seconds, Mr. Retes’ car is entirely engulfed in gas with cars to the front and side of him, effectively blocking his vision and mobility (Fox 11, ICE agents, protesters clash during raid at Ventura County farm). In the span of four minutes since his arrival on the scene, Mr. Retes is encased in tear gas where, he recounts, being subjected to escalated violence, arrest, and detainment (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’).

True to history, the people have spoken out against these violations through assembling in peaceful protest. Article 20 of the United Declaration of Human Rights protects the right “peaceful assembly” which, also true to history, has been met with varying levels of forceful opposition (un.org). On October 24th, a video during one of the Chicago protests shows senior ICE officer Gregory Bovino throwing what is believed to be a tear gas cannister, despite the tactic being prohibited (NBC News, Border Patrol commander appears to throw tear gas at protestors, 0:16). Just over a month prior shows a pastor among other protestors in the same city briefly collapse after being “shot in the head with a pepper ball” by an ICE agent (Fox32, Video shows federal agent shoot Chicago pastor in head with pepper ball during Broadview ICE protest). Nevertheless, these violations have not been the dissuading force we can only imagine they were intended to be, but have only served to further embolden citizens to act upon their rights. In a distant way, the practice draws a certain parallel to past protests in the name of human rights—albeit trading freshly-pressed suits for inflatable frog costumes—where protesters collectively endeavored to set the narrative of presenting themselves as non-threatening, despite authoritative publications dictating otherwise (Best, Anti-ICE protester’s frog costume gains a reach well beyond the small Portland pond; DHS Debunks New York Times).

Even so, the effects of these violations can still reverberate through the best of intentions. Calling back to the definition of “security of person” including psychological factors, one apparent effect of these violations is fear. Fear, when left unchecked, can make a monster out of anyone—and a person strained with it may be encouraged take drastic measures. Joshua Jahn took his fears to the extreme when, on the 26th of September, he opened fire on ICE agents during a detainment process. His recorded intention was to instill the same fear that they brought to the Dallas community, yet his actions instead created a deeper anxiety of retribution against the immigrant communities at the hands of ICE authorities (Santucci et. al 2025).

The extremes that unfettered fear can bring out in a society are what spurred President Franklin Roosevelt to detail the “freedom from fear” in his 1941 State of the Union Address (President Franklin Roosevelt’s Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)). The “Four Freedoms Speech”, which would later inspire the foundational rights in the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, were born during the time of great uncertainty: The Great Depression and the second World War. The post-war world he idealized was not one that required or used greater force to maintain power and stability. He looked toward a world where, among other freedoms, men and women were unbound by the weight of a looming threat—be it economical or physical. Most of all, he dreamed of the freedom born when human rights stand at the forefront of society. How that relates globally in today’s world is not the purpose of this article; how our government has allowed the current directive of ICE to abuse the people under the guise of national security is.

This article mentioned earlier the importance of human rights as a reminder to governing powers of our humanity. When our humanity is forgotten or abandoned, fear sets in. This blind attribution of power to one agency has generated a currency of fear that leaves those who deal in it broken. Human rights are not to be treated as inconsequential. Their existence sets a precedent for governments and their respective societies to build and improve upon, and fosters accountability in cases of abuse or negligence. That is why delegitimizing their authority through contradictory actions is dangerous. A rhetoric of violence does not create the trust and unity that a government desires in its constituents; instead, it breeds fear, discord, and collectively undoes the bonds that bring us together. The banner of national security should not be waved to permit the existence of this cruelty against humanity, but to ensure the safety and sanctity of it.

“I came around the corner and saw the vests and realized that I was witnessing what appeared to be an ICE arrest,” Mink told Bethesda Today in a phone interview.
According to Mink, the two men who approached her in the video were both involved with a different, earlier immigration arrest she filmed.
Mink’s encounter on Monday raises questions about the rights of bystanders when observing or filming presumed immigration enforcement actions.
Department of Homeland Security representatives have publicly described filming ICE agents and posting the videos online as “doxing” and suggested that the practice may not be legal.","Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink said Tuesday she was “grabbed” by a man Monday morning as she tried to film what she believed to be an immigration enforcement action in Prince George’s County.

Mink (D-Dist. 5) posted a video of the interaction to her social media page Tuesday. In the video, a group of at least five people can be seen gathering in the parking lot of Tick Tock Liquors on University Boulevard East just south of Mink’s council district.

“I came around the corner and saw the vests and realized that I was witnessing what appeared to be an ICE arrest,” Mink told Bethesda Today in a phone interview.

As Mink films from a distance, a man wearing a black face mask appears to beckon her toward him. He walks closer to her, points at her and says, “you need to go.”

“Mind your own business,” the man in the black mask can be heard saying.

A second man wearing a camouflage tactical vest, a leg holster with a gun and a badge attached enters the frame saying, “you got to go.” He can be seen putting a hand on Mink’s arm and pulling her in the opposite direction from where she was filming.

“Don’t touch me,” Mink can be heard saying. “Don’t grab my phone.”

Mink continues filming as the people she was filming get into vehicles – some without front license plates – and drive away. The incident was first reported by Montgomery Perspective.

Mink told Bethesda Today she believed the people in the video were Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents because she recognized some of their faces from previous encounters in the area.

She said she could tell from the license plate that one of the vehicles at the scene Monday was the same one that had been spotted near New Hampshire Estates Elementary School in Silver Spring during morning drop-off.

According to Mink, the two men who approached her in the video were both involved with a different, earlier immigration arrest she filmed. In that instance, they both yelled at her, but none had ever touched her before Tuesday, she said.

Spokespeople for ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Bethesda Today on Tuesday afternoon about whether the people in Mink’s video are affiliated with ICE.

Mink’s encounter on Monday raises questions about the rights of bystanders when observing or filming presumed immigration enforcement actions.

A growing number of federal courts have ruled that the First Amendment protects people’s right to record government officials in public, but that right may be subject to some restrictions, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

Department of Homeland Security representatives have publicly described filming ICE agents and posting the videos online as “doxing” and suggested that the practice may not be legal.

Mink said she decided to share the video of Monday’s incident because it is “important to raise awareness that we are seeing increased aggression, not just towards me but towards the public in general.”

“Clearly, they want to keep what they are doing in the shadows as much as is possible,” Mink said of the ICE agents. “I think that was evident from their reaction to me.”",https://assets.bethesdamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193881177-e1762907537909.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:57:15.058050

Lopez said that at least nine of the people detained were farmworkers. She said the arrests will have an impact on area growers who rely on migrant labor.

All of the people detained were immigrants, according to an Oregon for All release, but their identities — let alone each individual's immigration status — could not be immediately confirmed.

The brief video, captured by Jesse Ashton, shows several men wearing bullet-resistant vests surrounding a car near a downtown Olympia intersection. The clip, which quickly spread on social media, captures passers-by honking and shouting, “We don’t want you in our community.”

“I had an idea it was ICE,” Ashton said. “When they boxed him in, I immediately knew.”

Olympia police confirmed that the arrest was a federal immigration operation, but said their department was not notified or involved. Interim Police Chief Shelby Parker reaffirmed Olympia’s sanctuary-city status in a statement, writing that, “federal immigration authorities do not have access to OPD systems or data, including the Flock Safety camera network.”

Her assurance comes as a University of Washington Center for Human Rights study raised new doubts about how federal agents may obtain information from local surveillance tools. The report, published in October, found ICE and other federal agencies had accessed Flock license plate data from several Washington state law enforcement agencies, potentially in violation of state privacy and immigration-limitation laws.

The city of Redmond has since disabled its Flock cameras after ICE reportedly arrested two men near one of its devices last week. Olympia, by contrast, has defended its program, saying it operates with “the strictest data privacy” settings. City officials point to a contract amendment signed in May 2025 that bars Flock Safety from disclosing any data without written authorization from the city or a valid court order.

In a new statement on Tuesday, Assistant City Manager Stacey Ray reassured residents again about Flock data protections:

“The City of Olympia, like other communities in the region, is hearing from community members with concerns about the use of Flock cameras. The City Council will hold a study session with Interim Chief Shelby Parker on Dec. 2 at 6:00 p.m., during which Chief Parker will provide a briefing on the City’s use of Flock cameras and respond to questions from Council members. City council study sessions are open to the public to attend in person or virtually; public comment is not accepted during study sessions.

The Olympia Police Department is deeply committed to protecting community member privacy and public safety. The department proactively addressed early concerns about Flock cameras in May 2025, amending our contract with the vendor to strengthen privacy and legal safeguards regarding data use and disclosure. The agreement makes it legally impossible for Flock to disclose Olympia’s data without the City’s express consent or a valid legal mandate, ensuring the highest data ownership and oversight available under state and federal law.

Additionally, every search performed by Olympia personnel or an approved Washington state law enforcement agency is permanently logged with a reason for the search. Our Flock administrator conducts regular internal audits to ensure full compliance with state law, department policy, and the City’s contractual protections.

We publish monthly reports on the use of the City’s Flock system on our City website, Flock Safety, to help community members stay informed on when and how the cameras are being used to solve crimes in our community.

Our safeguards exceed state requirements and the standards recommended by both Flock Safety and the Washington State Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC). In an October 2025 study done by the University of Washington, researchers found that the City of Olympia was one of only a handful of departments in the state for which an audit in 2025 did not contain any searches. This independent finding confirms that Olympia’s restrictive configuration functions exactly as intended, protecting community data while maintaining essential investigative capabilities.”

Still, some residents are unconvinced. Sebastian, with the anti-surveillance group Deflock Olympia, said the city’s assurances ring hollow.

“Whether or not they believe what they’re saying, there’s no way to safely put those cameras up and not expect other agencies, anyone with even just a phone — to get into them,” he said.

Ashton, the witness, said he filmed the arrest to make the incident public. “I feel sad for people who have to go through this,” he said. “I can’t imagine how their kids feel when their dad or mom doesn’t come home.”

Olympia police said they will brief the public next month during a city council study session on how the department uses Flock cameras. That meeting is on Dec. 2, but doesn't allow for public comment. Deflock Olympia said it plans to rally outside that meeting.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/07def219-4498-42e7-88cb-f7e63268c85b/20251112T023026/07def219-4498-42e7-88cb-f7e63268c85b_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 12:56:52.142074

The language appears to allow GOP senators to sue over steps that the Justice Department took during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump related to the 2020 election. In October, Senate Republicans revealed an FBI document that showed investigators had obtained phone record data from eight senators and one congressman for calls they made in the days before and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The records were obtained pursuant to a subpoena in 2023, and the new legislation covers alleged violations dating back to 2022.

The revelation that their call records were obtained infuriated the lawmakers, who accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to target Republicans.

""The FBI's actions were an unconstitutional breach, and Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel need to hold accountable those involved in this serious wrongdoing,"" said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Biden administration's actions were ""arguably worse than Watergate."" A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new legislation.

The document said the FBI collected ""limited toll records,"" which include information about which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the contents of the conversation themselves.

In a letter to lawmakers on Oct. 21, attorneys for Smith defended his investigative steps as ""entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.""

According to the indictment of President Trump in connection with the 2020 election, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory. Smith's lawyers have said he is eager to testify publicly about the two Trump probes he oversaw.

The language in the new legislation requires service providers to alert Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests senators' data, and says a court cannot delay the notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.

The bill further states: ""Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency.""

The bill says senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation of the notification provisions, and it prevents the government from invoking several types of immunity to rebut the claims. Suits can be brought up to five years after a senator is first made aware of a violation, and allows senators to bring suits for any instances that occurred after January 2022. The FBI analyzed the senators' call records in 2023, meaning they could bring lawsuits under the legislation.

The government can defend against a suit by asserting that a senator was a target of a criminal investigation and by showing that a required notification about the records being pursued was delayed under a court order.

The lawmakers whose records were obtained in 2023, according to the FBI document, were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/11/308b0ff3-730d-419c-8b54-c22fbbb65cbd/thumbnail/1200x630g2/29edfd7c7d0682513796f2c6cec45aa4/gettyimages-2239226193.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:58:17.024316

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the United States about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it believes that the U.S. military strikes violate international law, sources told CNN. The sources also said that while Canada intends to continue its partnership with the U.S. Coast Guard, it has made clear to the United States that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said yesterday that he had ordered Colombia’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with U.S. security agencies until the strikes stop. Natasha Bertrand reports.

The USS Gerald R. Ford yesterday entered the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, according to a U.S. Navy statement. The statement described the Ford as being in the Western Atlantic, but a senior military official specified that the Ford and its accompanying vessels had moved into the Caribbean region. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

Venezuela is deploying weapons and planning to mount a guerrilla-style resistance in the event of a U.S. air or ground attack, according to sources and planning documents seen by Reuters. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López said yesterday, “The aggression will be responded to with national unity… we are ready here, we don’t want war.” However, a source close to the government said, “We wouldn’t last two hours in a conventional war.” Another source said that Venezuela was not “prepared or professionalized for conflict.” Reuters reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza under its control since the ceasefire began on October 10, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show. The actual number of destroyed buildings is likely much higher, as satellite imagery is not available in some areas. BBC News reports.

Israel reopened the Zikim Crossing north of Gaza City to allow humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza today, according to COGAT, the Israeli army unit responsible for facilitating aid to Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the crossing was shut on September 12. Israel’s military did not provide reasons for the closure. Jana Choukeir reports for Reuters.

UNICEF said yesterday that Israel is blocking the entry of 1.6 million vaccines and solar-powered fridges to store the vaccine vials into Gaza, adding that the syringes have awaited customs clearance since August. “Both the syringes and the… refrigerators are considered dual-use by Israel, and these items we’re finding very hard to get through clearances and inspections, yet they are urgent,” a UNICEF spokesperson said. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

Internal U.S. documents linked to President Trump’s Gaza peace plan, obtained by POLITICO, depict major implementation challenges, including uncertainty about whether an International Stabilization Force can be deployed. The compendium of documents was presented last month during a two-day symposium for U.S. Central Command and Civil-Military Coordination Center members. Dasha Burns, Felicia Schwartz, Nahal Toosi, and Paul McLeary report.

The Israeli parliament on Monday advanced a bill that would mandate the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israeli citizens. In the first vote, the bill passed with 39 in favour and 16 against, out of 120 lawmakers. Several key political parties boycotted the initial vote. Alexander Cornwell and Steven Sheer report for Reuters.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Dozens of masked Israeli settlers yesterday attacked two Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank, setting fire to vehicles and other property, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. Israeli police said that four Israelis were arrested during the assault, which they described as “acts of extremist violence.” The Israeli military said that four Palestinians were wounded. Josef Federman, Shlomo Mor, and Melanie Lidman report for AP News; Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

“The situation has significantly worsened” in parts of the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, where “the enemy advanced in fierce fighting and captured three settlements,” Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief for the armed forces Oleksandr Syrski said yesterday. Ron Popeski and Oleksandr Kozhukhar report for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“Despite the rising need, humanitarian operations [in Sudan’s North Darfur region] are now on the brink of collapse,” the U.N. International Organization for Migration said yesterday, adding “warehouses are nearly empty, aid convoys face significant insecurity, and access restrictions continue to prevent the delivery of sufficient aid.” IOM said that nearly 90,000 people have left El Fasher and surrounding villages since the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary’s recent capture. Noha Elhennawy reports for AP News.

Women fleeing El Fasher have reported killing, rape, and disappearance of their children following its capture by the RSF, the U.N. agency for women said yesterday. “There is mounting evidence that rape is being deliberately and systematically used as a weapon of war,” U.N. Women Regional Director for East and Southern Africa Anna Mutavati said. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Thailand has demanded an apology from Cambodia after accusing it of laying fresh landmines that have injured Thai soldiers, a Thai foreign ministry official said today. “We asked them to find the facts on what happened and who is accountable, and with it, asked them to put in place measures to prevent the future recurrence of the situation,” the official added. Cambodia’s defence ministry yesterday denied having laid the new landmines. Panu Wongcha-um and Chayut Setboonsarng report for Reuters.

EU and Indian navies have taken control of an Iranian-fishing vessel used by pirates off the coast of Somalia in the hijacking of the Malta-flagged tanker Hellas Aphrodite, the EU Naval Force said today. Jon Gambrell reports for AP News.

Multiple states, including the United Kingdom, Spain, Norway and Sierra Leone, at a U.N. review meeting yesterday urged Libya to close its migrant detention centres, citing evidence from rights groups of torture, abuse, and killing of detainees. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk yesterday called for an investigation into the deaths of hundreds of people who protested against the election in Tanzania. Türk said there was “an apparent attempt to conceal evidence” of the killings. Chadema, the main opposition party, said that about 2,000 people were killed during the protests earlier this month. The Tanzanian government has yet to give an official death toll. AP News reports.

Pakistan accused India of pursuing “state terrorism” after a suicide bombing yesterday in Islamabad killed 12 people, though it offered no evidence in support of the claim. “India unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations being made by an obviously delirious Pakistani leadership,” the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Responsibility for the attack was later claimed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, an affiliate of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. Humza Jilani reports for the Financial Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration is planning to deploy the U.S. Border Patrol to Charlotte, N.C., and New Orleans, according to a government document and a federal official. Plans for the operation are still being finalized. Dana Goldstein and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times.

The “highly unusual payment [of $7.5 million]– to one of the most corrupt governments in the world [Equatorial Guinea] – raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of the American taxpayer dollars,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday. The $7.5 million is the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees from the United States.

Dozens of Venezuelans deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador earlier this year were subjected to torture and other serious abuse, including sexual violence, according to a report published today by Human Rights Watch and Cristosal. The Trump administration accused all of the 252 deportees of being linked to the Tren de Aragua criminal organization without providing evidence; they are now detained in El Salvador’s maximum security prison known as the Center for Terrorism Confinement.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Israeli President Isaac Herzog received a letter from Trump urging him to consider granting a pardon to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Herzog’s office announced today. “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this ‘case’ against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time […] is a political, unjustified prosecution,” Trump said in the letter. Herzog’s office said that anyone seeking a presidential pardon must submit a formal request as per established procedures. Tala Ramadan and Steven Scheer report for Reuters.

Earlier this month, German State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Finance Steffen Meyer raised concerns about the financial burden on Germany caused by the U.S. government shutdown with U.S. diplomat Alan Meltzer, according to a State Department cable obtained by POLITICO. Meyer stressed that the offer to cover the salaries of 11,000 employees working on U.S. military bases in Germany was an “exceptional measure.” Meltzer did not speculate on the duration of the shutdown, but confirmed that the United States would repay the German government for the salaries paid out.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump administration plans to allow new oil and gas drilling off the coast of California, according to a draft plan shared with the Washington Post. The administration’s plan proposes six offshore lease sales between 2027 and 2030. Sources said that the Interior Department could announce the proposal as soon as this week. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) yesterday called the plan “disgraceful” while speaking at COP30 in Brazil.

The Trump administration has determined that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) funding mechanism is unlawful, according to a court filing on Monday, adding that it therefore considers the CFPB to be legally barred from seeking additional money from the Federal Reserve. This move would leave the CFPB without money to operate from early next year. Michael Stratford reports for POLITICO.

The Justice Department yesterday announced that it is investigating how UC Berkeley prepared for a Turning Point USA event on Monday night. The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division posted two letters on social media requesting campus communication records related to how the university prepared security for the event and responded to the protests. “I see several issues of serious concern regarding campus and local security and Antifa’s ability to operate with impunity in CA,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K Dhillon said.

""An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,"" Johnson told the United Nations Human Rights Council last week.","Mayor Brandon Johnson is preaching a message of unity on immigration issues, putting him again at odds with some other leaders in the Black community.

Why it matters: President Trump's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" has resurfaced tensions between Chicago's Black and Brown communities that flared during the 2022-24 migrant crisis, when $300 million spent on new arrivals left resentment in underinvested Black communities.

The big picture: While some Black leaders are leaning into the divisions, others are urging cooperation. Johnson told the United Nations last week that Trump's immigration operation is an ""assault on the dignity of all Chicagoans.""

What they're saying: ""We love [the ICE raids] because this is what we've been asking for,"" Chicago Flips Red co-founder Danielle Carter-Walters told the ""Awake Illinois"" podcast last week.

Organizer and former mayoral candidate Jaymal Green said on Instagram, ""All the Black people that are getting mad at ICE and Donald Trump alone — you got to get mad at the politicians right here locally … [They] decided to dump the migrant issue on the Black community like they do every single time.""

The other side: ""The divisions between Black and Latino people are significant and there are valid concerns, but at this moment, it's suicidal to not be unified,"" said actor and rapper Vic Mensa in a social post last month.

""The same agents of the state are attacking, abducting and killing us both at the same time, and they're relying on our separation right now.""

Mensa also warned about the dangers of these divisions in an October essay for the New York Times.

Zoom out: ""The sentiment in the Black community is extremely mixed,"" Cornel Darden, chair of the Greater Chicagoland Black Chamber of Commerce, told Axios.

""We do know Jaymal Green very well and follow his views, which we think definitely represent a large segment of the Black community.""

Yes, but: Black owners of landscaping, construction and food businesses are losing employees in the ICE raids, and Black real estate businesses have made money providing shelter to migrants, Darden said.

Between the lines: Rapper and Chicago School Board member Che ""Rhymefest"" Smith told Axios, ""I see both sides of the debate, but at the end of it all, we have to stand on the side of humanity. We need to use this opportunity to all link arms, otherwise we're missing out on a chance to truly fight back in a robust, effective way.""

The bottom line: Just as he did during the migrant crisis, Johnson finds himself fighting battles with outsiders and some inside the Black community. But he's not backing away.

Among issues the former detainee and others cited in courtroom testimony about conditions at the facility were overflowing toilets, no way to clean themselves and nothing to eat beyond half-frozen Subway sandwiches. A federal judge out of the Northern District of Illinois responded on Nov. 5 by ordering the Department of Homeland Security to improve conditions.

Now, on Nov. 13, another judge is set to visit the facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb 12 miles west of the city, to ensure court orders are being followed.

On Nov. 7, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura K. McNally authorized attorneys who filed a lawsuit to visit the site. McNally also plans to visit, according to court filings.

""No one should be subjected to the treatment and conditions that individuals at Broadview are currently experiencing,"" civil rights attorney Alexa Van Brunt said in a statement. The MacArthur Justice Center Illinois office director is representing Moreno Gonzalez and other detainees. ""These are urgent and necessary measures to protect these detainees and preserve their basic human rights. Our democracy is no place for inhumane, unsafe detention conditions.""

Van Brunt, attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois and others filed a lawsuit over conditions on behalf of Moreno Gonzalez and former detainee Felipe Agustin Zamacona. In response to testimony and court filings, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order compelling immigration authorities to make improvements.

""It’s a disturbing record. We don't want to treat people the way I've heard today people are being treated,"" Gettleman said after hearing hours of testimony. ""These are not convicted felons, these are civil detainees.""

Homeland Security says reports of poor conditions are 'FALSE'

Homeland Security officials defend conditions at the facility: ""All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers. No one is denied access to proper medical care. Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are FALSE.""

Jana Brady, an attorney for the defendants, acknowledged the site is operating beyond its normal capacity but said ""it's a learning curve"" and authorities are working to improve conditions, citing that officials are providing wipes to detainees so they can clean themselves.

In court filings from Nov. 10, Homeland Security lawyers say improvements at the site include ""lights out"" overnight and access to attorneys for detainees.

Detainees testified previously that lights were kept on overnight at the facility. Their lawyers say they still have trouble speaking with clients and have not been able to verify there is a ""lights out"" period or whether other court-mandated improvements have been implemented.

ICE facility at the heart of Midway Blitz crackdown

The facility is an immigration enforcement processing center where detainees are brought before being moved out of state. The site has become a focal point of immigration enforcement activity amid President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz crackdown.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin has said over ""3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members"" have been arrested in connection with the blitz. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify the criminal background or immigration status of detainees.

The site was designed to hold people for no more than 12 hours but witnesses testified in court that detainees are being held for as long as 12 days.

Gettleman, the judge presiding over the case, said from the bench on Nov. 4 that the facility ""has really become a prison.""

Anti-immigration enforcement protesters have targeted the site and called for it to be shut down following reports of poor conditions. Federal agents have deployed chemical agents on protesters and a Democratic Congressional candidate was indicted in connection with the protests.

Illinois State Police took over crowd control outside the site in early October. Dozens have been arrested at protests outside the facility since then, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/06/USAT/87114980007-20251102-t-042720-z-135743320-rc-2-znhashkxm-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=5472,3078,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-12 06:57:17.106235

The Department of Homeland Security suddenly moved up the implementation of a rule change that gives the Federal Protective Service, the agency charged with protecting federal buildings, more power to charge people with crimes for a variety of activities on or near federal property.

The regulation, which went into effect on Nov. 5, prohibits a wide range of activities, including creating a loud or unusual noise, distributing informational materials and flying drones. It makes it illegal for people to wear masks to conceal their identities if they break any federal or state law or local ordinance. It forbids obstructing access to federal property or impeding operations there and specifically calls out photography and videography.

Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S./Mexico Border Program, said he’s concerned that vague definitions in the regulations will give officers too much discretion.

“It seems overly broad and would provide federal agents flexibility to determine broadly how the new regulations are being violated,” Rios said.

Though the proposed rule was introduced on Jan. 15, just days before President Donald Trump took office, current DHS Secretary Kristi Noem decided to move up the timeline because of the administration’s concerns about anti-ICE activities, according to a press release from the department. The rule was set to take effect in January 2026.

“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities. We’ve seen rampant violence against law enforcement including our officers shot at, rammed by vehicles, assaulted and threatened,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we will not tolerate violence perpetuated by Antifa and other domestic extremists who are targeting federal property and law enforcement. Law and order will prevail.”

Videos of interactions between the public and ICE officials have raised questions about at least some of the agency’s claims of aggression against its staff.

Volunteers who have been monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests on federal property are worried that the new rules will affect their ability to document the agency’s actions, including potential human and civil rights violations during arrests.

“I question as to why they would move towards preventing people from documenting what’s happening inside,” Rios said.

He worried that the government would use the rules to cover up misconduct by ICE.

Since May, volunteers with several San Diego groups, including Detention Resistance, have monitored arrests in the immigration court hallways and at the ICE offices where people go periodically to check in or pick up paperwork. Whenever ICE makes an arrest, the volunteers film with their phones.

That included a video of ICE officers arresting Sayed Naser, an Afghan man who previously worked with the U.S. military in his country and who had shown up for a court hearing as part of his asylum case. Because of the video, veterans have rallied to support other Afghan allies with upcoming immigration court hearings.

On Wednesday, the first day of the new regulations, faith leaders and Detention Resistance volunteers stood in the brown hallways on the second floor of the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building in downtown San Diego. That’s where ICE has offices for people who are required to check in periodically with its officers.

One faith leader stood praying with a family outside the waiting room for the check-in appointments. Another stood near the elevators that lead to the basement holding cells—the route that ICE officers typically use when they arrest someone at a check-in.

Around 10 a.m., two of the family members walked out of the waiting room, their faces distraught. They spoke briefly with the faith leader who had prayed with them before leaving quietly. A few moments after they left, two ICE officers led a woman—their other family member—to the elevators, her mascara wet on her face.

The volunteers sprung into action, filming and following from a distance to capture the interaction. One volunteer softly offered words of support, referring to the woman as compa, or friend, the word that volunteers use for everyone with hearings or check-ins. In less than a minute, the woman was gone.

Rios is also worried that the new regulations could affect protesters in the plaza outside the federal building.

“The way it reads, they would prevent people from expressing themselves in ways that would be criticizing the administration or its policies,” Rios said.

As he spoke, he stood watching a weekly demonstration organized by San Diego labor leaders. Last week, the Thursday morning protest featured mariachi, ballet folklorico and dozens of people marching around the plaza.

At one point, organizers called on Rios to address the crowd. As he described ICE arresting a mother shortly after she dropped her children off at school, the crowd yelled, “Shame!”

Rios said that the administration appears poised to put Border Patrol agents in charge of certain ICE operations, causing concerns that the already violent arrests around the country will grow more so. Rios said that those in border regions, including San Diego, already know the difficulties and risks of living under the thumb of Border Patrol.

A student from the University of California, San Diego, told the crowd that international students on campus are afraid to go to class because of ICE’s actions.

Once the speeches finished, the demonstrators walked in a circle around the large, triangular sculpture in the plaza, and the mariachi band played. Some members of the crowd danced as the crowd chanted for justice for immigrants.",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cap-and-Main-111225.jpg?fit=2121%2C1414&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-12 06:57:04.534983

They are also demanding the Trump administration stop deporting third-country nationals to El Salvador.
“We reached the conclusion that the Trump administration is complicit in systematic torture and enforced disappearances of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador,” said Juanita Goebertus, HRW’s Americas director.
“People held in Cecot said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention.
“With Kristi Noem visiting directly and recording that video, the US government is very clearly complicit in the very serious and systematic torture that Venezuelans faced,” she said.","More than 252 Venezuelans expelled to El Salvador under Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy suffered systematic and prolonged torture and abuse, including sexual assault, during their detention, according to a report published on Wednesday.

The report, compiled jointly by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Cristosal – a group investigating violations in Central America – says conditions at El Salvador’s sprawling “terrorist continent center” (Cecot) breached the UN’s standard minimal rules for the treatment of prisoners. It cites “inhumane prison conditions, including prolonged incommunicado detention, inadequate food” and other shortcomings.

The groups accuse the Trump administration of willful complicity in the suffering deportees endured after being flown to El Salvador in March and April, insisting that it ordered the men’s deportation while fully aware that they would be mistreated or even face threats to their lives.

They are calling an “independent investigation” by the US justice department, although they admit the prospect is unlikely. They are also demanding the Trump administration stop deporting third-country nationals to El Salvador.

US connivance in what is depicted as a systematic pattern of torture and human rights abuses evokes comparison with the scandal at Bahghdad’s Abu Ghraib facility during the “war on terror”, they say.

“We reached the conclusion that the Trump administration is complicit in systematic torture and enforced disappearances of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador,” said Juanita Goebertus, HRW’s Americas director.

Citing previous state department reports recording harsh prison conditions in El Salvador, she added: “The administration knew that they were sending people to a place where they could be tortured and could be facing life-threatening risks.”

The Trump administration paid the Salvadorian regime of President Nayyib Bukele – who has styled himself as “the world coolest dictator” – $4.7m to cover the costs of the detention, the report says.

Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal – which was recently forced to suspend its operations in El Salvador – accused the Trump administration of “hir[ing] the Salvadorian prison system as a prop in a theatre of cruelty”.

“They wanted to demonstrate and send a message of brutality,” he said. “But I don’t know if they knew how far it would go and how terrible the horrors of torture are.”

The 81-page report paints a harrowing picture of the conditions suffered by the Venenzuelans, many of them asylum seekers from the authoritarian regime of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and roughly half having no criminal record, despite official accusations that the deportees were “terrorist” members of Tren de Aragua, an organized crime gang. Only 3% had been convicted in the US of a violent crime, according to the report.

“Detainees were subjected to constant beatings and other forms of ill-treatment, including some cases of sexual violence,” it says.

“Many of these abuses constitute torture under international human rights law.

“People held in Cecot said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention.

“These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and psychological suffering. Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.”

According to one former inmate, identified in the report as Gonzalo Y, the facility’s director had a chilling for the new arrivals after their deportation from the US. “You have arrived in hell,” he told them, a sentence used as the report’s title.

The report, based on more than 200 interviews and “forensic” corroboration of the interviewees’ testimonies, details beatings being administered for minor infractions, such as talking too loudly, showering at the wrong time, or even asking for medical treatment.

Some inmates recounted being beaten following a visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross and on another occasion, after a visit by Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, who posted a video of herself standing outside a prison cell in which the incarcerated deportees were crammed.

The beatings following Noem’s visit were inflicted after the prisoners shouted demands to be freed on the grounds that they were not criminals or terrorists, according to Goebertus, who said Noem’s high-profile visit proved the administration’s awareness of the abuses occurring at Cecot.

“With Kristi Noem visiting directly and recording that video, the US government is very clearly complicit in the very serious and systematic torture that Venezuelans faced,” she said.

Three prisoners also recorded being sexually abused, with one man saying he was forced to perform oral sex on a guard. The report said sexual assaults were more widespread but were not reported due to the social stigma.

The men were freed in July as part of a deal with Maduro’s regime that included the release of 10 Americans and US residents who were being held in Venezuela.

Bullock said the Venezuelans’ treatment reflected “a broader pattern in Salvadorian prisons” that has seen 90,000 Salvadorians arbitrarily detained, disappeared and systematically tortured in the past three years.

“It’s caused the deaths of at least 420 people, according to our investigations, although we think it’s probably many more,” he said.

“There’s a large and very credible body of evidence that demonstrates that in Salvadorian prisons, the El Salvador government itself could be committing crimes against humanity – and that’s the prison system that the United States contracted to disappear the migrants into.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3069f559bae5cc2d8658115e65fc3f8564adcd12/341_0_3407_2726/master/3407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b97153f5a79bb6629ccce3bbae8bbd65",N,,2025-11-12 06:57:08.511611

The Senate passed that legislation on Monday evening, and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on it on Wednesday afternoon.
The House rules committee will consider the bill on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for it to come to the House floor on Wednesday.
Top House Democrats oppose it, with the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, calling it a “partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.
“It’s our expectation that the House will vote at some point tomorrow and House Democrats will strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,” Jeffries told CNN on Tuesday.","As House Republican leaders move to hold a vote on legislation to reopen the US government, top Democrats vowed on Tuesday to oppose the bill for not addressing their demand for more healthcare funding.

Democrats have for weeks insisted that any measure to fund the government include an extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans, which were created under Joe Biden and due to expire at the end of the year, sending premiums for enrollees higher.

With Donald Trump’s encouragement, Congress’s Republican leaders refused, sparking a spending standoff that resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. But the Democrats’ resolve cracked earlier this week, when a splinter group in the Senate joined with the GOP to craft a compromise bill that reauthorizes government funding through January, without extending the tax credits.

The Senate passed that legislation on Monday evening, and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on it on Wednesday afternoon. The House rules committee will consider the bill on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for it to come to the House floor on Wednesday.

Top House Democrats oppose it, with the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, calling it a “partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.

“It’s our expectation that the House will vote at some point tomorrow and House Democrats will strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,” Jeffries told CNN on Tuesday.

The House’s largest ideological caucus, the centrist New Democrat Coalition, has announced its opposition to the measure.

“While New Dems always seek common ground, our coalition remains united in opposition to legislation that sacrifices the wellbeing of the constituents we’re sworn to serve,” chair Brad Schneider said.

“Unfortunately, the Senate-passed bill fails to address our constituents’ top priorities, doing nothing to protect their access to healthcare, lower their costs or curb the administration’s extreme agenda.”

The sentiment appears much the same in the Congressional Progressive caucus, where chair Greg Casar called the measure “a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them”.

The Democratic opposition threatens to make for a tight vote for the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, who has kept the House out of session for more than 50 days in an attempt to pressure Senate Democrats into caving to the GOP’s demands.

With a 219-member majority assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no.

But Democrats may have their own defectors. Maine’s Jared Golden, who last week announced he would not seek another term representing a district that voted for Trump last year, was the only Democrat in September to vote for a Republican funding bill that did not extend the tax credit. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, whose Washington state district is similarly friendly to the president, also expressed her support for that bill.

Both lawmakers’ offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how they would vote on the Senate’s compromise.

The compromise bill cleared the Senate on Monday evening by 60 votes, the minimum it needed to overcome the chamber’s thresholds for advancement. All Republicans supported the measure’s passage except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office.

That group was composed of Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the party.

While they did not win an extension of the tax credits, the group claimed credit for getting the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, to agree to hold a vote by mid-December on extending the subsidies. However, it remains to be seen if enough Republicans will support its passage, and Johnson has not agreed to put the issue to a vote in the House.

Though the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, did not back the bill publicly, Shaheen told Fox News on Monday that the group “kept leadership informed throughout” their talks. Progressive organizations who backed Schumer’s strategy during the shutdown have now turned on him, for allowing the compromise to come together.

Indivisible announced plans to support Democratic candidates in primaries who oppose Schumer remaining as the party’s leader, and MoveOn joined in the calls for him to bow out.

“It is time for Senator Schumer to step aside as minority leader to make room for those who are willing to fight fire with fire when the basic needs of working people are on the line,” MoveOn Political Action’s executive director, Katie Bethell, said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5112ae09b7200a07299c11593e962bfea390c981/643_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d0bcf142df45fe02d54c923d41ef4e20",N,,2025-11-12 06:56:59.550722

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (""IHRA"") to make two key changes of which Illinois employers should be aware. The new law takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to all charges filed or pending on or after August 15, 2025.

Fact-Finding Conferences Are No Longer Mandatory

Previously, every charge filed with the Illinois Department of Human Rights (""IDHR"") required a fact-finding conference—a meeting in which both parties appeared and responded to questions from an IDHR investigator.

Following the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be discretionary. A conference will only occur if:

Both the complainant and the respondent submit a written request within 90 days after the charge is filed; and

The parties agree in writing to grant the IDHR an additional 120 days to complete its investigation.

If the IDHR issues its investigative report before both requests are received, no fact-finding conference will take place. The IDHR also retains discretion to require a conference even if neither party requests one, but such conferences are expected to occur far less frequently going forward.

The amendment gives employers and complainants a new strategic choice at the outset of an IDHR investigation—whether to request a fact-finding conference or proceed without one. Skipping the conference may reduce costs and time commitments involved in dealing with an IDHR charge; however, participation in a fact-finding conference has its utility, as the conference may help clarify the factual issues alleged by the employee or encourage early resolution. Employers should consult counsel promptly after receiving a charge to evaluate the best approach.

New Civil Penalties Authorized

The amendment also gives the Illinois Human Rights Commission (""IHRC"") new authority to impose civil penalties ""to vindicate the public interest"" for each act that constitutes a civil rights violation under the IHRA.

Although both the IDHR and the IHRC enforce the IHRA, they serve different functions. The IDHR investigates charges of discrimination and issues findings on whether substantial evidence supports a violation. If the IDHR finds substantial evidence and the matter is not resolved, the case may proceed to the IHRC, which serves as the adjudicative body. The IHRC conducts hearings and issues final decisions on liability—and the new civil penalties apply only at that stage, after a finding of a violation.

The maximum penalty depends on the employer's history of prior violations:

Up to $16,000 per act per aggrieved party for a first violation;

Up to $42,500 for a second violation within five years; and

Up to $70,000 for two or more violations within seven years.

If the same individual committed both the current and prior violation, the higher penalty levels may apply even if the prior violation occurred outside those timeframes.

The addition of these penalties increases the potential financial exposure in cases brought under the IHRA. Employers must remain vigilant: robust anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, training, documentation, and consistent enforcement are more important than ever.

What Employers Should Do Now

Review internal procedures for responding to claims of discrimination or harassment, including IDHR charges.

Engage counsel early to make informed, strategic decisions about whether to request a fact-finding conference.

Monitor IDHR guidance on how it will exercise discretion to require or decline conferences.

Reinforce anti-harassment and anti-discrimination compliance measures in light of the new penalty structure.

Takeaways

Illinois has moved from a mandatory to a discretionary model for fact-finding conferences, giving employers greater flexibility in responding to discrimination charges. At the same time, the addition of new civil penalties raises the stakes for compliance. Early engagement with counsel and proactive workplace training and policies remain the best way to manage risk.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13376_2834.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 06:57:13.203665

Rectifying the damages caused by false pleadings is a costly endeavor and should be strategized with care.","A single error in the date and manner in which a plaintiff purchased avocado oil led to extreme sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel in a consumer class action case.

Last week, the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Golikov v. Walmart Inc. found that Class counsel acted in subjective bad faith by recklessly raising a frivolous argument and unreasonably multiplying proceedings after failing to correct a single erroneous allegation.

In Golikov, Plaintiff’s Complaint alleged that the plaintiff purchased a product from a brick-and-mortar store instead of truthfully disclosing that the purchase was made on the defendant’s website. The Complaint did not reveal that to make a website purchase, Plaintiff was required to enter into a binding arbitration agreement and waive the right to pursue a class action.

The Court did not agree that Plaintiff’s counsel’s efforts to point to subordinates for the “error” amounted to inadvertence, holding “recklessness can be established when a leading attorney fails to check a subordinate’s work and independently verify the facts and law.” Plaintiff’s counsel also argued that the error was inconsequential because Plaintiff made both in-store and online purchases. The Court was not persuaded stating “Plaintiff’s in-store purchases still do not change the fact that the Complaint and the FAC make a claim that Plaintiff purchased a bottle ... on November 14, 2021 from a … store, when she actually did not do so. Accordingly, the action was based on an argument advanced without factual merit.” (emphasis added.)

Moreover, the Court also concluded that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to correct the error and continued to advance their frivolous position in opposition to both a Motion to Compel Arbitration and a Motion to Decertify the Class, unreasonably multiplying proceedings in violation of the duty to “correct or withdraw litigation positions after it becomes obvious that they are meritless.” In short order: a class was certified, discovery undertaken, the Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings was granted, and the Motion to Decertify the Class and the Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to 28 USC Section 1927 were briefed. The Court ordered Defendants to brief the appropriate attorney’s fees as sanctions for Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct. Defendants will likely seek significant attorney’s fees as sanctions due to the volume of work that the frivolous allegation created.

Lessons For All

“Inadvertence” is not a free pass when an error is determined to have been made in bad faith and recklessly. All counsel must take caution to review and verify the work of their subordinates. Further, in the Federal Courts, should counsel learn that an allegation of fact is not accurate, or an argument or position is no longer supported or justified, they must work to correct the error and minimize legal proceedings. Rectifying the damages caused by false pleadings is a costly endeavor and should be strategized with care.",https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/_images/content/CDF-OG-logo.png,N,,2025-11-12 10:58:30.451319

El Paso County Sheriff Joseph Roybal petitioned the justices last month after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Darlene Griffith, a transgender inmate who has challenged being detained with men.

The 10th Circuit reasoned that the prison’s decision to identify Griffith by biological sex ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, which protects against discrimination on the basis of sex or race.

Sheriff Roybal appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have ruled differently on the topic and the justices need to settle the matter.

“The consequences are severe,” Sheriff Roybal’s filing reads. “Hundreds of cases now flood federal courts, with prison officials facing litigation from all sides: transgender inmates demanding classification by gender identity; female inmates challenging housing decisions that require them to sleep, live, and bathe with biological males who identify as female; inmates objecting to searches by certain officers; and staff asserting dignity concerns about cross-sex searches. Courts admit ‘there is little uniformity to be found among their decisions.’”

His petition asks the justices to rule that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment “does not require treating the fluid, subjective concept of transgender identity as a sex-based or stand-alone constitutional class.”

“For over two centuries, American prisons and jails have classified and housed inmates and detainees based on biological sex. This long-standing practice advances institutional security, prevents sexual violence, and preserves the privacy and dignity of those in custody and of staff,” the petition states.

“By transforming an inmate’s subjective gender identity — of which there are over 70 — into a sex-based constitutional classification triggering heightened scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit has subordinated prison security and the privacy interests of all to the preference of one in contravention of this Court’s prison-administration precedents,” the petition said.

The 10th Circuit decision allows for barring male officers from searching inmates who are transgender women.

“Such a rule is constitutionally absurd. And it disregards administrative expertise, creates dignity and safety concerns, and ignores the operational realities of running detention facilities like county jails,” the sheriff’s petition argues.

Griffith has taken hormones. The inmate has complained about being denied feminine products like lipstick, panties and a bra because those items are not allowed in male facilities.

Sheriff Roybal argues that allowing transgender detainees to have feminine products makes them vulnerable to harassment and violence.

Griffith’s filing urges the justices not to take up the case. According to the court records, Griffith has been living as a woman for more than 20 years and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria before entering the El Paso County Jail in 2020.

The inmate’s filing says that being treated as a male has led Griffith to suffer emotional distress and attempt self-castration.

“During her time at the Jail, Ms. Griffith experienced anxiety and exacerbated symptoms of gender dysphoria,” the filing reads. “She filed numerous grievances in which she described these issues, and repeatedly requested exceptions from the Jail policies. Ms. Griffith specifically informed the Jail that she ‘had previously been housed in female units in other correctional facilities,’ but was informed that she would continue to be housed in a male unit at the Jail pursuant to County policy. The County’s policies caused Ms. Griffith to suffer significant emotional distress, which led her to attempt self-castration.”

It would take four justices to vote in favor of hearing the dispute for oral arguments to be granted later this term.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/18/Supreme_Court_Transgender_Health_51425_c0-199-4788-2992_s1200x700.jpg?745ca6165c42a86c96336a0e12dbdd365db74e4a,N,,2025-11-11 22:01:21.102149

SHUTDOWN STATUS: A bipartisan bill to end the government shutdown heads to the House after the Senate passed the measure last night with support from eight Democrats and the backing of President Donald Trump. The House could vote as soon as tomorrow, the 43rd day of the shutdown.

SNAP BENEFITS: The Supreme Court this evening extended a freeze on a federal judge’s ruling that would require the Trump administration to fully fund the SNAP food program in November. That pause could be moot if the bill to reopen the government, which includes full SNAP benefits through September, is signed into law in the next couple of days.

TRUMP APPEALS CARROLL VERDICT: Trump asked the Supreme Court to review a $5 million civil judgment that found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

Bipartisan funding bill would allow senators to sue over government searches of their phone records

A provision tucked into the the funding package that the Senate passed last night as a part of a bipartisan deal to reopen the government would allow senators to sue the federal government for potentially millions of dollars if their data is obtained without being notified.

The legislative language would uniquely benefit eight Republican senators who were recently found to have had their phone records — but not the contents of their calls or messages — accessed as a part of the investigation that led to former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

While the bill does not explicitly mention Smith’s probe, the language would retroactively apply to data requests that were made on or after Jan. 1, 2022, meaning the request of the Republican senators’ data, which was made on Sept. 27, 2023, would be susceptible to a lawsuit.

The eight senators who had their phone records accessed are: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.

Trump: H-1B visas help 'bring in talent' that the U.S. lacks

Trump defended H-1B visas during part of a Fox News interview that aired tonight, even as his administration has moved to make the visas costlier for qualified workers from abroad to obtain.

Asked whether his administration would prioritize the visas, Trump said the U.S. has to ""bring in talent.""

When pressed by Fox News host Laura Ingraham about existing talent in the U.S., Trump responded: ""No, you don't have — you don't have certain talents. And you have to — people have to learn.""

Trump has at times offered contradictory remarks on immigration. While he often suggests that immigration has allowed ""criminals"" into the country, other times he has acknowledged the role it plays in economic growth and innovation.

Trump signed a proclamation in September requiring companies to pay a $100,000 fee to obtain H-1B worker visas in a move that marked a win for immigration hardliners on Capitol Hill, but that posed a costlier hurtle to tech executives seeking qualified workers from abroad.

JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and other CEOs set to visit the White House tomorrow

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and other CEOs will visit the White House tomorrow for a dinner with Trump, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.

The dinner would be the latest in a series of high-profile events that Trump has held with top business executives.

In September, he hosted a dinner that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The White House said that discussion ""centered on harnessing artificial intelligence to propel the U.S. to the forefront of global innovation.""

To influence Trump on Colombia, Sen. Bernie Moreno brought a fake image of the country’s president

When Trump hosted Republican senators for lunch at the White House on Oct. 21, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, came prepared.

Moreno, who was born in Colombia, has become a key voice on policy involving the Latin American nation — and one that’s deeply critical of the current left-wing president, Gustavo Petro.

Two days before the lunch, Trump, at odds with Petro for months, posted on social media that Petro was “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs” in Colombia. Trump said he was stopping all U.S. aid to the country and told reporters he would soon announce new tariffs on Colombia.

Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach — directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled “The Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.” In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.

Supreme Court extends temporary pause on $4 billion in SNAP payments for November

With a potential end to the government shutdown in sight, the Supreme Court tonight extended a freeze on a federal judge’s ruling that would require the Trump administration to fully fund the SNAP food program in November.

The decision means the government, for now, does not have to distribute about $4 billion in additional SNAP funding as required by Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell. The Supreme Court block remains in place until midnight on Thursday.

The case would likely become moot if the shutdown ends, as the bipartisan bill to reopen the government would fully fund the SNAP program through September of next year. The House is expected to vote tomorrow on the Senate-passed measure to end the record-long shutdown.

Nearly 42 million people rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.

Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva to be sworn in tomorrow

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is scheduled to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva tomorrow — nearly two months after the Arizona Democrat won her late father’s seat in a special election.

Johnson has consistently said he would administer the oath of office to Grijalva when Democrats vote to reopen the government. The Senate passed a bipartisan measure to do just that last night, with the House expected to vote on the legislation tomorrow.

When Grijalva is sworn in, the House breakdown will be 219 Republicans to 214 Democrats.

Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on the discharge petition to force a House floor vote requiring the Justice Department to publicly release all the files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. There is still an additional waiting period of seven legislative days before any of the signers of the petition can force a vote on it. The House speaker then has two legislative days before he must call up the measure for a vote on the floor.

Trump calls for a salary cap for NCAA sports. One already exists.

During a phone interview today on ESPN's ""Pat McAfee Show,"" Trump suggested that ""colleges are all going to go out of business, no matter how rich they are"" unless ""very powerful caps"" are created to limit the salaries of collegiate athletes.

A type of salary cap already exists in the NCAA, however.

In June, a judge approved the landmark House settlement between the NCAA and Division I athletes that allows universities to share revenue gained from athletics and directly pay their athletes for the first time. Universities can disburse up to $20.5 million during the 2025-26 school year. That cap will increase by an estimated 4% annually over the lifespan of the decade-long deal.

The payments are on top of scholarships and other financial benefits the athletes can receive. Schools that have elected to pay athletes under the revenue-sharing cap have devised different models for dividing the payments. Of the $20.5 million this year, Texas Tech University projected sharing 74% with players on its football team. The University of Missouri, by comparison, has reportedly elected to spend a smaller percentage on football, while paying out more to its men's basketball and baseball teams.

Trump said he was concerned that the payouts would lead schools to eliminating ""lesser sports.""

“It is a very serious problem because even football, when they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13 million, $14 million, I read a couple of them, and all of a sudden you’re going to see it’s going to be out of control, and even rich colleges are going to go bust,"" Trump said.

House Rules Committee will meet tonight to set rule for floor debate on the bipartisan government funding bill

The House Rules Committee will meet at 6:30 p.m. to take up the Senate-passed funding package to reopen the government.

The rules panel is a necessary step before the legislation can make it to the House floor. The committee will create a rule that will dictate how floor debate goes tomorrow, including how long it takes.

Trump administration tells judge that CFPB will run out of funding early next year

The Justice Department today notified U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who oversaw the lawsuit on the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that the independent agency may be out of money as soon as early 2026.

“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026,” DOJ attorneys wrote. They cited an Office of Legal Counsel opinion out this week that says beyond Dec. 31, 2025, “there are no funds available from CFPB’s congressionally authorized source of funding.”

“Because the only lawful source of funding from the Federal Reserve has dried up, the proper method for additional funds is to request them from Congress pursuant to the Appropriations Cause, not to draw from the Federal Reserve without a congressional appropriation,” T. Elliot Gaiser of the Office of Legal Counsel wrote this week.

In light of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion, the DOJ writes, “the Acting Director of the Bureau anticipates preparing a report to the President and to congressional appropriations committees, as statutorily required, identifying the funding needs of the Bureau.”

“The Bureau does not know whether and the extent to which Congress will appropriate funding to pay the expenses of the Bureau,” the Justice Department added.

Trump lauds Department of Veterans Affairs' efforts to cut benefits backlog

Trump claimed in his remarks at Arlington National Cemetery today that his administration has made headway in addressing a yearslong backlog of veterans' benefit requests, saying the department has reduced unprocessed claims by half since he took office in January.

""That’s a big achievement, and Doug is going to get it down to zero,"" Trump said, referring to Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins.

Trump vowed to eliminate ""100% of that backlog. We’re moving at that pace, and already we processed more than 3 million backlog claims,"" he said.

In August, the VA said that it had processed about 2.5 million claims this fiscal year and was ""completing them 17.8% faster"" than in fiscal 2024 despite what it said was a 10% uptick in claims.

Asked for more recent figures, VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz shared a graph that he said supports Trump's claim. Kasperowicz said there were 264,717 claims still not processed at the end of the Biden administration. While the graph shows that figure is down to 134,000, Kasperowicz said the graph lags the latest number, which he said is now less than 120,000.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to move last month from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean to support Trump's efforts to dismantle alleged drug-carrying operations.

The strike group's area of responsibility is known as SOUTHCOM, which encompasses Latin America south of Mexico, the waters next to Central and South America, and the Caribbean, according to the Pentagon.

Republicans demand tougher abortion restrictions to extend Obamacare funds

Senate Republicans say they’re open to extending a pot of Affordable Care Act funds that will expire at the end of the year — but only if Democrats acquiesce to stricter abortion restrictions on insurance plans.

The demand presents a significant hurdle to reaching a bipartisan deal to extend ACA funding, designed to avoid major premium hikes next year for more than 20 million Americans, as Democrats are adamant that existing abortion guardrails under Obamacare are sufficient.

What to expect after the House comes back tomorrow

For the first time since Sept. 19, the House will be in session and holding votes tomorrow.

In order to reopen the government, the House needs to pass the same legislation that the Senate passed last night. This package extends government funding through Jan. 30 and also includes a “minibus” of three full-year appropriations bills and fully funds SNAP benefits through the end of next September.

Members of the House were notified last night to return to D.C. for votes as early as 4 p.m. tomorrow. Here’s what will happen next:

The Rules Committee will meet at some point, likely this evening. to approve the short-term funding bill and pass a rule that will dictate floor debate. As of this writing, the committee has not finalized its meeting time.

Tomorrow, the House is expected to convene at 12 p.m. ET. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Republicans that the first order of business will be swearing in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz. The House will take up the bill sometime after that.

After she is sworn in, the House breakdown will be 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats. This means a majority is 217, so Republicans can only afford to lose two of their own on a party-line vote.

When the House passed the measure in September, the vote was 217-212 with two Republicans opposing it: Rep. Tom Massie and Rep. Victoria Spartz. Only one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, supported the measure.

Trump touts actions to reduce veteran homelessness

Trump touted his administration's efforts to reduce veteran homelessness, including his executive order in May to establish the National Center for Warrior Independence, which provides housing, job training and substance abuse services to veterans in the Los Angeles area.

He also highlighted his signing of the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act in July, which aims to help veterans avoid foreclosures.

Trump pointed to veteran unemployment rates, which fell from 4.2% in January to 3.1% in August, the last month of available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump notes other countries celebrate 'Victory Day,' but 'we’re the one that won the wars'

In his remarks, Trump noted that several countries hold annual celebrations to commemorate the victories in World War I and World War II while the U.S. typically did not participate in similar celebrations.

""They were all celebrating, we're the one that won the wars,"" Trump said, calling out France in particular.

Shortly after, he mentioned the United Kingdom and Russia as well.

""When I see other countries celebrating Victory Day — I watched it. I watched U.K., I watched Russia, they were celebrating Victory Day in World War II, and I said, 'We got to have a Victory Day,'"" Trump said. ""Nobody even talked about it in our country. But from now on, we're going to be celebrating Victory Day.""

Cabinet members attend Trump's Veterans Day speech

Trump pointed out several members of the Cabinet who are at his Veterans Day speech.

The speech appeared to be attended by Secretaries Doug Collins, Pete Hegseth, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Doug Burgum, Chris Wright, Linda McMahon and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Trump also shouted out to Budget Director Russ Vought, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Watchdog group files ethics complaints against Lindsey Halligan

The watchdog group Campaign for Accountability has filed formal complaints with the Florida and Virginia bar associations against the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan.

The left-leaning group accuses Halligan, a former Trump personal attorney who has brought criminal cases against his political adversaries James Comey and Letitia James, of violating multiple rules of professional conduct, including the prohibition of the prosecution of a charge the prosecutor knows is not supported by evidence.

""Ms. Halligan’s actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,"" the complaint says.

The complaint does not seek any specific penalty against Halligan, but calls for the bar associations to investigate her and “impose appropriate disciplinary measures” if they find any ethical violations occurred.

Halligan's conduct ""undoubtedly will erode public trust in the legal system if permitted without consequence,” the complaint says.

Halligan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

White House responds to reports about backlash to top House official over 50-year mortgage remarks

A White House spokesman responded to reporting that White House officials are “furious” with Bill Pulte, who runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency, for pitching Trump on a 50-year mortgage plan.

“President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs,"" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said. ""The White House and the entire Trump administration are appreciative of Mr. Pulte’s efforts, and everyone is working together to implement the President’s policies.""

Politico reported that the White House was “blindsided” by the move and is dealing with backlash from allies and lawmakers after Trump posted a message on Truth Social over the weekend that showed an image of “Great American Presidents,” with a photo of President Franklin Roosevelt under the words “30-year mortgage” alongside Trump and “50-year mortgage.”

Pulte later replied: “Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage — a complete game changer.”

Trump also discussed the idea in an interview with Fox News that aired yesterday.

A White House official told NBC News: “President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.”

FBI director visits China for talks on fentanyl and more

FBI Director Kash Patel visited China last week to discuss fentanyl and law enforcement issues, arriving in Beijing on Friday and holding talks with Chinese officials Saturday, according to a source familiar with the visit.

His visit was first reported by Reuters.

During talks with Trump last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to intensify China’s efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals. In exchange, Trump reduced his fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods to 10% from 20%.

Yesterday, China announced new restrictions on the export of 13 precursor chemicals to the United States, Canada and Mexico, including those used to produce the synthetic opioid that is blamed for tens of thousands of U.S. overdose deaths each year.

Janet Mills hits Susan Collins for ‘betrayal’ after she rejects ACA funding extension

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is vying to challenge Republican Sen. Susan Collins next year, criticized the Republican senator for joining her party to vote down a one-year extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies in the run-up to passage of the government funding bill.

“Susan Collins just voted against extending the ACA subsidies. This vote is a betrayal of Maine people, and it will send health care costs through the roof,” Mills said on X. “While I have fought to expand health care and to make it more affordable, Senator Collins and Republicans in Washington are doing the opposite.”

In response, Collins campaign spokesperson Shawn Roderick told NBC News the senator wants income-based restrictions on the ACA funds in order to renew them.

“Susan Collins has been clear that she supports extending the ACA subsidies, but believes there should be an income cap so wealthy people are not eligible for subsidies that are intended for people who are struggling to afford their insurance,” Roderick said. “Janet Mills’ position seems to be that wealthy Mainers making $300,000 a year should receive taxpayer funded health care subsidies.”

Trump requests Supreme Court overturn verdict in E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse and defamation case

Trump asked the Supreme Court yesterday to review a $5 million civil judgment that found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

A jury in 2023 awarded the judgment after it found Trump liable of sexual abuse, following Carroll’s allegations that Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in 1996 and later defamed her during his first term by referring to her allegations as a “hoax” and a “con job.”

Utah judge rejects GOP redistricting effort, approving new map with a Democratic-leaning seat

A Utah judge late last night rejected new congressional district lines drawn by Republican state lawmakers, instead approving a new map drawing a solidly Democratic seat with voters from Salt Lake City that’s likely to flip in next year’s midterms.

The ruling is a blow for Republicans, who had designed a map to protect the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation, and a big win for Democrats who have struggled to find places to respond in kind to Republicans’ mid-decade redistricting efforts and win control of the House.

House vote to reopen the government could take place as early as tomorrow afternoon

House lawmakers were notified last night that votes on the Senate-passed legislation to reopen the government could start as soon as 4 p.m. tomorrow, according to a whip notice.

The notice indicates that multiple vote series are likely. The House Rules Committee will need to approve a rule that the full House must adopt before debate and a vote on the legislation itself.

The House last held votes Sept. 19.

Trump addresses financial concerns of air traffic controllers working without pay for more than 40 days

Trump repeated criticism last night of air traffic controllers who have been absent during parts of the record-long government shutdown, when they’re required to work without pay.

During a Fox News interview, Trump discussed the employees who in some cases have had to take on second jobs to pay their bills amid a funding lapse that will hit the six-week mark today.

“You know, a lot of people who showed up also had a second job. They took a second job temporarily. But they all know the money’s coming, and the money was coming,” Trump told host Laura Ingraham.

Steve Kornacki: Republicans took a political hit in the shutdown. How long will it last

With the government shutdown now poised to end, it’s clear Republicans are in worse shape politically now than when it started. The question is whether that will prove to be temporary — as has been the case with past funding showdowns — or if the political atmosphere has been reset in a way that will linger into next year’s midterm elections.

As the six-week shutdown played out, Trump’s job approval rating ebbed to the lowest point of his second term, with a majority of voters pinning the blame on him and Republicans in Congress. Democrats opened up a wide lead in the generic congressional ballot — 8 points in our NBC News poll, a level last seen in the run-up to the “blue wave” in the 2018 midterms.

And then there was last Tuesday, when Democrats posted an unexpected landslide in New Jersey, a state where both parties saw the gubernatorial contest as competitive and recent elections had suggested Republican momentum. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s victory was so staggering that it lifted a host of downballot Democrats and gave the party its largest state Assembly majority in a half-century. The Democratic rout was even bigger in Virginia: The party’s deeply flawed candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, coasted easily on the coattails of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.

Off-year election losses spark Republican concerns about redistricting

Trump is confident that he drew the right battle lines when he launched a nationwide redistricting fight to try to preserve the Republican House majority, GOP strategists familiar with the White House’s thinking say — even after last Tuesday’s election results gave Democrats openings to counterstrike in California and Virginia.

But two other Republicans close to the White House told NBC News that there are growing concerns in the party that the political war is not going as planned — that the juice may not have been worth the squeeze and could, in a nightmare scenario, result in a net gain for Democrats. And within broader GOP circles, misgivings about the strategy heightened last week after California voters overwhelmingly approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts in a manner that Democrats hope will flip five House seats in their direction.

Democrats rebel after 8 senators cut a deal to end the shutdown without ACA funds

Many Democrats are fuming after a breakaway group of eight senators teamed up with Republicans to strike a deal to reopen the government without extending health care subsidies, backing off on the demand that led to the shutdown.

The agreement, which cleared a key procedural hurdle late Sunday by a vote of 60-40, sparked heavy criticism from congressional candidates, progressive activists and Democratic lawmakers. That includes some members with higher ambitions, who said it shows party leaders are not up to the task of marshaling effective opposition to Trump.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent pointed a gun toward a woman who was allegedly following and recording him on Sunday in Santa Ana, according to police in nearby Fullerton and a social media video post.

The details: The Fullerton Police Department said in a Facebook post Sunday that one of its officers witnessed a man getting out of his car at the intersection of Santa Ana Boulevard and Shelton Street and pointing a gun in the direction of a woman in another car. When the Fullerton officer stopped to investigate, the man presented credentials showing he was an ICE agent and said he had stopped the woman because she was following and recording him, according to the post.

Tense moments: The incident was caught on video and shared by media outlets, including LA Taco. The man who identified himself as an ICE agent appears to be in plainclothes and holding a gun. A tense verbal exchange follows. A woman’s voice can be heard in the video asking what the man is doing, noting that he pointed the gun at her and questioning why local police are “helping” him. When the man says, “You can’t be following us,” she yells, “I live here!”

Not a crime: The Fullerton officer told the agent he could not assist with someone following or recording him if no crime had occurred, the department said in its post. The woman left the area shortly afterward. The officer then left the scene, the department said.

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, so everybody has a different risk tolerance in Chicago, so there’s a different way to contribute and chip in for everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you for being with us.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman in New York. Juan González is in Chicago, where protests are continuing over the Trump administration’s massive immigration raids. Over the weekend, federal immigration agents reportedly pepper sprayed a father and his 1-year-old daughter at close range in the parking lot of a grocery store in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. On Friday, police arrested 14 mothers who were protesting outside the Broadview Immigration Jail.

PROTESTOR: There aren’t enough people speaking up. There are people protesting here at this Broadview ICE facility every Friday, but not enough. We are in our communities being terrorized by ICE and Border Patrol. They are tear gassing neighborhoods for fun. We saw that in court this week, video of them saying, “Have fun,” as they threw tear gas canisters at a residential neighborhood.

They ran in this week to a daycare center and pulled the teacher out in front of toddlers, who were screaming and crying. In my school, at the elementary school, we have to walk children to and from school because their immigrant parents are afraid to leave the house. Our entire community in Chicago and across the suburbs are being terrorized by ICE and Border Patrol. We are moms, we are mad, we are coming together to say that families should not be torn apart, immigrants should not be targeted.

AMY GOODMAN: The Broadview protests came days after a shocking video went viral showing armed ICE agents in black vests dragging a teacher out of a Spanish immersion daycare and preschool in front of the children and parents. Diana Santillana Galeano at the Rayito del Sol Spanish immersion early learning center, community members, including Democratic Congressmember Delia Ramirez, have denounced her arrest.

CONGRESSMEMBER RAMIREZ: They didn’t just walk in chasing one person. They went into multiple rooms asking and looking for teachers, while children were present. This is an agency that has gone rogue, and it’s an agency that believes in as long as they can cover their face, they can get away with anything.

It is why this immediate press conference was so important and why all of us are here with the parents, with teachers, with someone who I just talked to an hour ago, and she said, “Delia, I don’t think I can go back to work tomorrow. I don’t know that I’m safe.”

AMY GOODMAN: We go now to Chicago, where we’re joined by Tara Goodarzi, a parent of a 3-year-old who attends Rayito del Sol where Diana Santillana Galeano was detained by ICE on November 5 in front of parents and the young kids. Tara, thanks so much for being with us. You came right after this happened. Can you describe what everyone described? Of course, we see this woman being taken out, the teacher at the daycare center. Explain what the kids and the parents saw.

TARA GOODARZI: Hi, good morning, Amy. Thanks so much for having me. Yeah, I was on my way to drop off my son to school when I started getting a bunch of calls and texts about the situation at the school. My son was super excited to start his normal day at his favorite place and see all his friends. And when we arrived, it was just a shocking scene. There were crowds of parents and teachers huddled together and crying, kids were crying, some were in corners, like, being shielded by their teachers, almost as if they were hiding. It was a devastating scene. And my son quickly became emotionally affected by it as well.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Tara, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed on X that individuals were attempting to barricade themselves inside the daycare center. What do you know actually happened when these agents arrived?

TARA GOODARZI: My understanding is that the teacher was just trying to get to work to start her normal day. She is a beloved member of our community. We want her to be there teaching our children. And she was followed in to the school. Our school has security measures in place, such as signs outside that say that it’s a private establishment for authorized personnel only, we have locked inner doors that prevent people from just walking in, and so Diana was allowed in to start her normal day. She is absolutely a teacher there. My understanding is she was just trying to get to work that day.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how have you and the other parents began to process what happened to the children of the daycare center?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, we have really banded together as a community as part of the larger efforts of resistance that have been happening in Chicago for months now. So, mirroring those efforts, we have started our own parent patrols outside of the school with whistles. Our whistles are kind of the only thing we have right now in Chicago to protect ourselves and our communities from these agents.

We’ve started meal trains, we’ve started ride-share programs for the teachers who are maybe too scared to drive themselves to work every day or even to go to their assigned court dates for some immigration hearings.

So, we have safe passage escort programs for them, we’ve also started legal defense funds, and we’re working on, like, master lists of readily available immigration counsel that can be of help to any educators that are in need. So, it’s really brought an awareness and a heightened sense of community to our neighborhood and our city in an effort to heal from the trauma that we faced last week and that we have been facing for months now, since the onset of Operation Midway Blitz.

AMY GOODMAN: GoFundMe has just exploded, supporting the teacher. Also, can you talk about the mutual aid networks that are providing ride-shares and groceries for neighbors who are too afraid to leave their homes now?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, so everybody has a different risk tolerance in Chicago, so there’s a different way to contribute and chip in for everybody. If you want to be a little bit more low-profile, there are mutual aid networks everywhere. In every neighborhood, a lot of organizations are starting their own, a lot of schools are starting their own.

There are food pantries that are constantly up and running, looking for volunteers to take shifts. People pack groceries, people sign up for delivery shifts all over the city. There’s just been an explosion, like you said, of opportunities to contribute to our immigrant communities. They are deeply, deeply important to us in Chicago, and right now, we just want to do everything we can to support them.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And do you think, Tara, that the institutions, the local institutions in this city, the police, the mayor, and the other elected officials are doing enough to assure the safety and tranquility of not only your daycare center, but of immigrants and folks throughout the city right now?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, I’m fully supportive of Mayor Johnson’s executive order that he signed a little while ago, which prohibited ICE from utilizing public spaces for any operations. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like that’s being adhered to. So, I think we really do need to reevaluate what else can be done to protect us from these federal agents.

Unfortunately, I have been at Broadview myself. I have seen Illinois State Police acting in a violent way towards peaceful protestors. And over the weekend, I saw Chicago Police officers doing similar activities. So, we are starting to get increasingly concerned about some of the state police activity that’s been happening, and I do think this is an issue that needs to be addressed with both the governor and the mayor.

AMY GOODMAN: And if you could finally, Tara, talk about how your little boy, 3-year-old, who came right after, but all the other kids terrorized and the parents, how are these kids dealing with what they saw, their teacher being dragged out? And she, herself, this Spanish immersion teacher of preschoolers, has two kids herself.

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, she is a mother, and she’s actually an infant teacher. So, we entrust Diana with our youngest kids at this school, babies. That’s how much we love and support her. People send their new babies, as young as four months, I believe, to be in her care every day. The kids have been so confused. The kids have been saying things like, “Are they going to take me next? If I speak Spanish outside, am I going to get taken from my mom? Where is my teacher? I miss Ms. Diana. I’m afraid.”

These are things that our children have said to us. My son was completely – like, he shut down emotionally after this happened. Kids process things differently, and he was just, like, so shocked by the state that his school and his safe place had transformed into. And we really need to start working on how to talk to our kids about these issues.

I’m personally working on some know-your-rights materials that can be, like, transferred to little kids, so we can start having these conversations with them as well as showing them, like, age-appropriate books about how to interact with our neighbors and our community and learn about what it means to be undocumented in Chicago, just so they can all start learning, unfortunately, from an early age what this has done to our city.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you for being with us. Tara Goodarzi, parent of a 3-year-old who attends Rayito del Sol daycare center, where one of the young teachers, Diana Santillana, was violently detained by ICE, dragged out of the school on November 5 in front of parents and young children.

Isolated from family, denied clear information, and eventually forced to confront the possible reality of not coming back home.
That silence my family faced when my cousin went missing is not unique.
But more often, it’s detective work: calling ICE detention centers where staff often won’t answer basic questions.
I followed every step: using the ICE locator system, searching federal prison databases, and calling local field offices.","For the past three months, I’ve been working as a detention documentation specialist at AFSC. I document human rights violations committed by immigration enforcement agencies and help locate individuals who’ve been detained. I never imagined that my work would overlap so directly with my own family’s story. But in many ways, that’s the reality of immigration in this country—a line between professional responsibility and personal experience can blur in hard, unexpected ways.

I have a cousin who lived in Los Angeles. He had immigrated to the U.S. from a small village on the coast of Guatemala. Growing up, I’d visit him there, where family friends looked after me, while my parents stayed behind as they worked to resolve their own immigration cases.

One day, my cousin messaged me a photo from Universal Studios. I learned he had been in L.A. with his uncle. Both worked long days painting houses, the kind of jobs that keep neighborhoods running but rarely get acknowledged.

But one afternoon in March of this year, my cousin never came home. Our family started calling, texting, checking in with neighbors. Hours passed.

It was through neighbors that we learned what had happened. ICE agents had picked them up in unmarked cars at their worksite that day. They wore masks, making them nearly indistinguishable from kidnappers. Because of his line of work, my cousin was caught in the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants from the U.S. My family had no information, no phone call, no official notice. Just silence, panic, and, eventually, anger.

A few weeks later, I learned that he had been transferred to a detention facility where he would remain in limbo for months. Isolated from family, denied clear information, and eventually forced to confront the possible reality of not coming back home. Ultimately, he was deported back to Guatemala.

That silence my family faced when my cousin went missing is not unique. Every day, people across the country wake up to find loved ones gone, swept into a system designed to disorient and create fear.

This is where my work with AFSC comes in. I help track people who are detained, piecing together information from our staff and other local organizers. Sometimes, it’s as straightforward as confirming someone’s name in ICE’s online locator system. But more often, it’s detective work: calling ICE detention centers where staff often won’t answer basic questions. It’s hours of checking databases that aren’t updated. All bureaucratic hurdles designed to exhaust.

As I scrambled for information about my cousin, I realized how closely this mirrored what I do as part of my role at AFSC: investigating disappearances, gathering evidence, and reconstructing the stories of people who suddenly vanish into detention.

What I’ve learned is that accurate documentation is not just about data—it’s about power. When we know where someone is, when we’ve recorded the details of how they were taken, when we can track patterns across ICE raids and facilities, we are building evidence. This evidence can support legal defense, inform advocacy campaigns, and give families a foothold in a process meant to overwhelm them.

The challenges are constant: misinformation, unanswered phone calls, bureaucratic resistance, and the emotional weight of the unknown. In one recent case, for example, I worked helped track a missing person picked up by ICE in New Jersey. He had been on his way to do landscaping work at around 6:45 in the morning.

I followed every step: using the ICE locator system, searching federal prison databases, and calling local field offices. After logging 20 unanswered calls to the ICE office in Newark, we finally confirmed that the community member had been transferred to a detention facility in Elizabeth and deported to Guatemala. The entire process had stretched over six days.

But the goal of our work is clear— to resist erasure. To ensure that people don’t slip through the cracks. To affirm that immigrants are not simply statistics but vital members of our communities. Each has agency, dignity, and stories that matter. They have family and friends who love them and rely on them. My cousin’s story is one of thousands, but each story is also evidence in a larger case for stopping detention and deportation that tears apart families and communities.

And yet, alongside this despair, it's important to acknowledge all the resilience and endurance I’ve seen. In New Jersey and around the U.S., AFSC supports individuals and organizations working every day to protect community members. Nationwide, volunteers are staffing hotlines to report ICE and forming rapid response networks to show up at detention centers, court hearings, and workplaces. Neighbors are organizing watch groups to warn each other when ICE is nearby and document what happens. Everyday people are rejecting government raids as normal.

Working on these cases, I'm often confronted with the reminder of my own helplessness. But I also remember the strength that comes from connecting with others who refuse to look away.

That’s the work I carry with me now: helping locate those who've gone missing—and also finding the threads of strength and solidarity that endure in the face of detention cruelty.

Immigration has and always will remain relevant to both my professional and personal life. Throughout these years, one truth has become clear: an immigration system built on detention and deportation cannot be fixed—it must be fundamentally transformed.

This means finding our collective strength, our shared humanity, and the power of community organizing. It means stories being told in full, not just as moments of suffering but as calls to action. Because to me, resistance now looks like ordinary people refusing to let fear dictate how they live.",https://afsc.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/pb_122454_elizabeth-detention-center-scr.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:01:53.744147

An email sent to the mayor and city council mentioned these reports, but did not confirm any details.

It emphasized that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has no role in federal immigration enforcement.

Councilman Ed Driggs stated that CMPD and the sheriff’s office have not indicated any coordination or communication from ICE, leaving them with little knowledge of the situation.

Councilman Driggs expressed concerns about the prospect of border patrol agents operating in Charlotte, stating, “I think the borders should be controlled, but when you have people kinda prowling the streets or whatever it is they plan to do here, that is disquieting.”

“We have issues that we’re confronting since the Iryna Zarutska killing,” Driggs said, “but I don’t think we need ICE here.”

Immigration attorney Jamilah Espinosa noted that non-profit organizations and community organizers are planning meetings to instruct migrants on their rights and what to do if detained.

“We want to make sure that they vet, that they really ensure that it’s ICE,” Espinosa said.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden requested that Customs and Border Patrol inform his office and local law enforcement of any enforcement actions in advance to ensure safety.

Non-profit organizations and attorneys supporting immigrants are mobilizing in response to the potential arrival of ICE in Charlotte.

They are organizing meetings to educate migrants on their rights and how to handle encounters with immigration officials.

Espinosa emphasized the importance of peaceful protests if ICE conducts operations in Charlotte, contrasting with the violent clashes seen in Chicago.

She advised allies of the immigrant community to share their voices rather than engage in confrontations with immigration officials.

Several local and state officials — including members of the Charlotte City Council, the Mecklenburg County Commission, the CMS Board, and the General Assembly — issued a joint statement reassuring immigrant communities amid reports of possible federal immigration enforcement in Charlotte.

They emphasized that immigrants are valued members of the community and should not feel alone or unwelcome. The officials pledged to ensure accurate information, open communication, and the protection of all residents’ safety and dignity.

The statement also clarified that federal immigration actions are directed by the Department of Homeland Security through ICE and CBP — not by local or state governments — and that CMPD does not enforce immigration laws or participate in federal immigration operations.

Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments.
The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof.","A few hundred feet apart, yet worlds away politically, furious students at UC Berkeley protested the final stop of the conservative organization Turning Point USA’s “American Comeback Tour,” hosted Monday night on what is known as the nation’s most liberal campus.

The event drew many older attendees who at various moments danced to “YMCA,” laughed, and held moments of silence for the late TPUSA leader Charlie Kirk.

Outside the event, students, most of them far younger than the attendees inside, faced off with police in riot gear, with physical fights prompting arrests. One man was taken to a hospital after being struck in the head.

On Tuesday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division would investigate the event. Attorney General Pam Bondi also tweeted that the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force would be launching a full investigation of what she called “violent riots at UC Berkeley.”

In a statement, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said the university is conducting a “full investigation” and “intends to fully cooperate” with the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify “the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event.”

During the event, a large police presence held back protesters several hundred feet away and held up batons and projectile weapons. The UC Police Department, private security, and law enforcement from Alameda County and San Francisco were staged at Lower Sproul, a plaza in front of Zellerbach. The event was strictly monitored, with bags, food, beverages, signs and flags prohibited.

Law enforcement had already begun in the early morning, with the UC Police Department arresting four students at midnight for felony vandalism for trying to attach a giant cardboard bug to Sather Gate at the campus entrance as a protest against the TPUSA event, as reported by the Daily Californian.

The event occurred exactly two months to the day after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the founder of TPUSA, who was shot on a Utah university campus while he debated students about his political viewpoints.

Two student reporters for CalMatters were at the event. Here’s what they saw both outside and in.

Outside, 4:30 p.m.

Protests were just beginning in Sproul Plaza, a central area on campus, while Lower Sproul Plaza, the area in front of Zellerbach Hall, was entirely barricaded by law enforcement. Surrounding campus buildings had closed as early at 12:45 p.m., causing student group meetings to be cancelled or moved to Zoom.

Unable to walk straight to Zellerbach Hall, the hundreds of protesters moved down Bancroft Way toward the campus’s Student Union, where event attendees lined up to enter the barricaded space in front of Zellerbach. A fight broke out between two men, one of whom was selling “Freedom” shirts. Their altercation and subsequent arrest briefly shut down the street.

Inside, 5:30 p.m.

Inside the event, attendees, most of whom were not students, filed in wearing red MAGA hats and “Freedom” shirts. As they took their seats, they danced to “Born in the USA,” “YMCA” and “Here Comes the Sun.”

Outside, 5:30 p.m.

A panic briefly ran through the crowd when a car on Bancroft Way began to backfire, mimicking the sound of gunshots, causing some attendees to duck and run as smoke filled the air. No one was injured, and the majority of protesters continued to chant and bang on the barricades in front of almost 20 UCPD officers holding up their batons.

Inside, 6:30 p.m.

Jobob Taeleifi, a comedian and friend of Kirk’s, kicked off the event, followed by John Paul Leon, UC Berkeley’s Turning Point USA chapter president, who announced the entrance of Christian apologist and Kirk mentor Frank Turek.

“When a bullet soared through the air, an assassin took the life of a courageous man,” Leon told the crowd. “The sad truth is, the left are not your friends. They will mock and dehumanize you just so they can laugh at your corpse … To all those protesters outside, I have one thing to say: It is clear to us which side is winning when your side becomes the violent agitators.”

Taeleifi, Leon and Turek all focused much of their speeches on criticizing the protests outside. Turek called Kirk a “martyr” and recounted his experience watching Kirk die.

“I’m never going to forget Charlie’s lifeless eyes looking back right past me,” Turek said.

Comedian Rob Schneider, who spoke after Turek, thanked “antifa” for their “welcome.” Schneider spoke about his experience at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event, did impressions of God and said, “God said Trump’s my guy.”

“There is an attack on Western civilization and the United States is the last bastion of hope,” Schneider said. “As Charlie Kirk said, if you do not assimilate, it is an invasion, and that is what we’re experiencing.”

Outside, 6:30 p.m.

Two people who were arguing began to fight. One was detained by the police.

The protest mostly congregated around one barricaded entrance to the event. Some were there in response to calls put out by UC Berkeley student activist groups like Students Organizing for Liberation, Young Democratic Socialists of America and Jewish Voice for Peace. In addition to the large number of students, protesters also included people who did not attend UC Berkeley – groups like SF Bay Activists held a “dance party” protest.

Away from the epicenter of the shouts and chants in front of police, many hung back just to watch and observe.

One student protester, Asha Genett, said she attended because she disagreed with Turning Point’s support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, which she called “human rights abuses.”

“I think that conversation between conservatives and liberals or leftists is important,” Genett said. “I don’t think the way that TPUSA strives to engage in that is productive or helpful. I think it’s inflammatory.”

Chants varied between condemnations of TPUSA’s conservative ideals, to calls for them to leave campus. Protesters shouted, “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F— Charlie Kirk.”

Protester Court Freund, a UC Berkeley master’s student who identifies as a Democrat and libertarian, said he disagreed with TPUSA on everything but free speech.

“My perspective is that TPUSA and other organizations I strongly disagree with, as long as they’re not espousing direct harm to someone on campus, they should be here and have a right to be here,” he said.

“By closing them out from our campus, which is supposed to be a hub for intellectual debate, so many progressives just want to shut out the other side,” Freund said. “By doing that, they automatically lose a large percentage of people.”

According to Mogulof, a 45-year-old male attendee of the TPUSA event was struck in the head with a glass bottle, and was transported to a nearby hospital for a laceration to his head.

Inside, 8:10 p.m.

A line of attendees filled the entirety of the aisle waiting for their chance to ask a question as Schneider hosted a Q&A with Turek, author Andrew Doyle and philosopher Peter Boghossian to conclude the event.

Jackie Jones, a student and comedy club co-president, asked Schneider if there are things comedians shouldn’t joke about, to which Schneider replied that it is a comedian’s job to “challenge” people and push boundaries. He also praised Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, calling him a “genius.”

Outside, 8:45 p.m.

Protesters circled Lower Sproul to block exits, facing off with police behind barricades as attendees left the event. Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments. The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof.

“These people can’t be negotiated with,” said student and event attendee Matthew Edgar of the protesters outside. “They would celebrate if I died. It’s nonsensical. I’m going to walk out of here, and I’ll probably have virtually no friends coming out of Berkeley.”

Platkin,[1] a case with significant implications for nonprofit donor privacy, First Amendment rights, and the ability of advocacy organizations to challenge state investigatory actions in federal court.

Case background

First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, Inc. (First Choice) is a faith-based nonprofit operating pregnancy centers in New Jersey. In 2023, New Jersey Attorney General (AG) Matthew Platkin issued an administrative subpoena under the authority of state law demanding, among other things, the names of nearly 5,000 donors and extensive records about the organization’s operations, advertisements, and personnel over a ten-year period. The stated concern was the potential misleading of donors and clients, but the subpoena did not cite any specific complaints or evidence of wrongdoing.

First Choice challenged the subpoena in federal court before the subpoena return date had passed and argued that it violated its First Amendment rights – specifically, the rights to free speech and free association, including donor privacy. The district court dismissed the case as unripe because it concluded that only a state court has the power to enforce or quash a subpoena issued under state law, requiring First Choice to litigate its constitutional claims in state court first.[2] In a divided opinion, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed and concluded that First Choice “can continue to assert its constitutional claims in state court as that litigation unfolds.[3] The result is that First Choice must risk enforcement and possible criminal penalties before federal courts will hear its constitutional claims.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve whether, where the subject of a state investigatory demand has established a reasonably objective chill of its First Amendment rights, a federal court in a first-filed action is deprived of jurisdiction because those rights must be adjudicated in state court.

Key legal issues

First Amendment rights: Does compelled disclosure of donor identities and internal documents by a faith-based nonprofit violate the right to free speech and association?

Federal versus state jurisdiction: Must federal courts defer to state courts in adjudicating constitutional claims arising from state investigatory actions, especially when federal rights are at risk of immediate harm?

Potential implications

If the Supreme Court sides with First Choice:

Strengthening donor privacy: A ruling for First Choice could reinforce the right of nonprofits – especially those engaged in advocacy or controversial issues – to protect donor identities from compelled disclosure by state authorities.

Federal forum access: It could clarify that parties facing a credible chill of First Amendment rights have immediate access to federal courts, rather than being forced to exhaust state remedies first.

Limits on state investigatory powers: States may face new limits on their ability to use subpoenas or investigatory demands to obtain sensitive information from advocacy organizations.

If the Supreme Court sides with the state:

Expanded state authority: States could have greater latitude to investigate nonprofits and compel disclosure of donor and operational information, subject to later federal review only after state proceedings are complete.

Potential chilling effect: Advocacy groups may be deterred from engaging in controversial speech or association if they fear compelled disclosure and lack immediate federal recourse.

Forum-shopping and litigation strategy: The decision could affect where and how constitutional claims are litigated, with possible increases in state court litigation over federal rights.

Key considerations for organizations

Nonprofits and advocacy groups: Organizations are encouraged to review their donor privacy policies and be aware of the potential for increased state scrutiny and investigatory demands.

Litigation strategy: Consider the risks and benefits of challenging state actions in federal versus state court and monitor developments for guidance on jurisdictional strategy.

Compliance and risk management: Consider steps to prepare for possible changes in the legal landscape regarding compelled disclosure and state investigatory powers.

State administrative subpoenas: If an organization is facing a state administrative subpoena, prompt and strategic action is key. Organizations are encouraged to work with counsel to assess the subpoena’s scope and to engage with the state agency, including, if necessary, challenging the validity of the subpoena in court.

As international law enforcement becomes increasingly interconnected, INTERPOL — the International Criminal Police Organization — now plays a significant role in immigration and security screening worldwide. Its 195 member countries share millions of records each year, including Red Notices and Diffusions that alert governments to individuals wanted for arrest or questioning.

For foreign nationals applying for asylum, visas, green cards, or U.S. citizenship, these alerts can have serious consequences: detention at the border, visa denial, rejection of naturalization, or even deportation. Yet not every notice is legitimate. Authoritarian governments have been known to exploit INTERPOL’s system to target political dissidents, journalists, and business competitors under the guise of criminal charges.

Recognizing and challenging such abuse is critical. A clear understanding of how INTERPOL works—and how it can be misused—can make the difference between a fair hearing and an unjust removal.

I. Overview of INTERPOL Notices

II. When Global Policing Collides with Immigration Law

The International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) maintains the world’s largest cross-border criminal database, linking 195 member countries in real time. Its “notices” — particularly Red Notices and Diffusions — were originally meant to help locate fugitives wanted for extradition.

In practice, however, these tools are increasingly misused by authoritarian governments to target political opponents, journalists, or business rivals living abroad. When such alerts surface in U.S. systems — like the FBI’s NCIC, DHS TECS, or the State Department’s CLASS database — they can trigger serious but unwarranted immigration consequences: visa refusals, citizenship delays, or even detention, despite the fact that these notices carry no judicial authority.

By INTERPOL’s own definition, a Red Notice or Diffusion is merely “a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.” It is not an arrest warrant, not a criminal charge, and not evidence of guilt.

These notices are administrative communications, not judicial findings. They are often issued before any formal indictment — or even in the absence of a valid arrest warrant in the requesting country.

Under U.S. law, INTERPOL notices hold no evidentiary value in immigration or asylum proceedings unless supported by credible, independent proof of criminal conduct.

III. Legal Nature of INTERPOL Notices: Not a Criminal Charge or Conviction

1. Core Legal Principle

● INTERPOL’s own definition: A Red Notice is “a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.”

● It is not an international arrest warrant, not a criminal charge, and not proof of guilt or conviction.

● Both Red Notices and Diffusions are administrative alerts—essentially information-sharing tools — often issued before any formal indictment or without judicial oversight in the requesting country.

● Under U.S. law, these notices carry no binding legal effect and no evidentiary weight unless backed by credible, independently verified evidence of criminal conduct.

2. U.S. Judicial and Administrative Decisions

● Matter of W–E–R–B–, 27 I&N Dec. 795 (BIA 2020) —

The Board of Immigration Appeals held that a Red Notice alone cannot establish probable cause or guilt. DHS must produce independent, corroborating evidence to substantiate criminal conduct.

● Khalikov v. Garland, 20 F.4th 568 (9th Cir. 2022) —

The Ninth Circuit found that an INTERPOL notice issued by Uzbekistan was politically motivated and could not justify asylum denial or be treated as proof of criminality. ● Doe v. Holder, 736 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2013) —

The Court ruled that foreign criminal allegations lacking due process protections cannot form a valid basis for inadmissibility or removal under the INA.

● Qatanani v. Att’y Gen., 637 F.3d 408 (3d Cir. 2011) —

The Court held that foreign convictions rendered under coercive or unfair procedures cannot be used to deny immigration benefits or naturalization.

● Gonzalez v. INS, 996 F.2d 804 (6th Cir. 1993) —

The Court concluded that police reports, hearsay, or unverified accusations from abroad are insufficient to establish removability or criminal inadmissibility under U.S. law.

● In re Extradition of Drayer, 190 F.3d 410 (6th Cir. 1999) —

The Sixth Circuit clarified that an INTERPOL Red Notice does not authorize arrest or extradition within the United States absent a formal treaty-based request through judicial process.

● Benitez v. Garcia, 495 F.3d 640 (9th Cir. 2007) —

The Court stated that a Red Notice is merely a police communication from abroad and does not carry the evidentiary weight of a valid judicial warrant.

● United States v. Demjanjuk, 367 F.3d 623 (6th Cir. 2004) —

The Court warned that foreign data transmitted through INTERPOL must be independently verified and cannot serve as proof of guilt without corroboration.

● Gonzalez-Castillo v. Garland (9th Cir. 2022) —

The Court reaffirmed that a Red Notice alone does not establish probable cause that a crime has been committed; additional evidence is required.

3. Federal Policy and Agency Guidance

● DOJ Criminal Resource Manual § 611 (INTERPOL Red Notices)

States that a Red Notice “is not a substitute for a U.S. arrest warrant” and cannot justify detention or extradition absent formal proceedings.

● ICE Directive 15006.1 (August 2023) —

Explicitly declares: “A Red Notice or Wanted Person Diffusion is not an international arrest warrant and conveys no legal authority to arrest, detain, or remove a person.”

● DOJ Office of International Affairs – Extradition Manual (2021)

Confirms that Red Notices are non-binding communications, and U.S. arrests must be based on judicial warrants or extradition requests through diplomatic channels.

Together, these authorities firmly establish that:

● INTERPOL Red Notices are not proof of criminal conduct;

● USCIS and DHS must rely on verified judicial evidence, not foreign police data; and

● Federal courts consistently reject attempts to equate Red Notices with convictions, indictments, or probable cause.

IV. INTERPOL Notices vs. U.S. Law

V. Misuse by Authoritarian States and USCIS Overreach 1. Authoritarian Misuse

Countries including Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Venezuela, Egypt, and Belarus routinely issue politically motivated Red or Diffusion Notices.

a) Russia

● Targets: opposition leaders, journalists, and business rivals.

● Cases: Bill Browder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Yevgeny Chichvarkin.

● The CCF has deleted dozens of Russian requests as violations of Article 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution.

b) China

● Campaigns: “Fox Hunt” and “Sky Net” to repatriate political exiles.

● Victims: Uyghur activists (Dolkun Isa), lawyers, and entrepreneurs accused of “economic crimes.”

c) Turkey

● Post-2016 coup, more than 60 000 notices filed against perceived Gülenists.

● Rejected en masse by INTERPOL for overt political character.

d) Venezuela

● Red or Diffusion Notices against opposition deputies and journalists labeled as “terrorists.”

● Many annulled by the CCF for lack of judicial independence.

e) Iran, Egypt, Belarus, and Central Asia

● Charges such as “blasphemy,” “economic sabotage,” or “subversion” used to persecute dissidents abroad.

● U.N. Special Rapporteurs have criticized the pattern as transnational repression.

The Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) has deleted hundreds of such notices for violating Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution, which prohibits political, religious, or military interference.

2. Case Studies Illustrating INTERPOL Misuse

1. Russian Entrepreneur (N-400 Denial Reversed) — USCIS denied naturalization citing “international tax charges.” Court ordered approval after CCF deletion and W–E–R–B– citation.

2. Venezuelan Journalist (Asylum Granted) — IJ ruled Red Notice corroborated persecution; asylum approved.

3. Chinese Investor (EB-5 Hold Released) — “Economic crime” Red Notice deleted; USCIS approved I-526.

4. Turkish Academic (H-1B Extension) — Red Notice labeled him “terrorist”; approval followed CCF confirmation and Khalikov reference.

5. Iranian Dissident Couple (Refugee Travel) — Detained at JFK; released after proof of CCF deletion.

6. Belarusian Tech Executive (Adjustment Approved) — USCIS withdrew NOID after evidence of political retaliation.

7. Kazakh Banker (Extradition Refused) — Federal court found Red Notice fabricated; ICE ended removal proceedings.

8. Egyptian Lawyer (Asylum Appeal) — BIA reversed IJ for reliance on INTERPOL data without due process.

9. Russian-American Dual Citizen (Judicial Review) — District Court granted N-400 under §1421(c); USCIS erred by equating Red Notice with charge.

10. Iranian Scientist (J-1 Reinstatement) — Red Notice alleging espionage deleted; Embassy issued visa after citing Doe v. Holder.

3. USCIS Misinterpretation and Common Errors

Even though U.S. courts have repeatedly clarified that INTERPOL data has no independent legal weight, USCIS continues to misuse Red Notices in ways that conflict with basic principles of due process.

Common errors include:

● Treating Red or Diffusion Notices as if they were pending criminal charges;

● Issuing Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs) or outright denials without verifying the authenticity or current status of the notice;

● Failing to distinguish between police communications and judicial convictions;

● Disregarding CCF decisions confirming that a notice has been deleted or that the individual has been exonerated.

This kind of administrative overreach has drawn judicial criticism and prompted federal lawsuits under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), challenging USCIS for arbitrary and unsupported decision-making.

Individuals who are wrongfully listed in INTERPOL databases can petition for deletion or correction of their data.

A complete application typically includes:

● Proof of identity;

● A legal brief citing Article 3 (political or discriminatory nature) and Article 12 (accuracy and relevance);

● Supporting evidence such as court dismissals, NGO or human-rights reports, or official findings of abuse.

The process usually takes 8 to 12 months and concludes with a written decision confirming either deletion or modification of the record — a document that can be vital in proceedings before USCIS, EOIR, or the Department of State.

It is essential to understand that an INTERPOL Red or Diffusion Notice is not a criminal charge, not a conviction, and not reliable proof of wrongdoing.

When such notices are misused — whether by authoritarian governments or, at times, by U.S. immigration authorities — they erode the principle of due process that underpins the American legal system.

Both federal courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals have drawn a clear boundary: only judicially verifiable evidence, not foreign police communications, can establish ineligibility or determine moral character in immigration cases.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16375_5914.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:02:18.852276

In October, the city of Center Line entered into a new agreement with ICE, giving local police officers the power to act as immigration agents. Known as the 287(g) Task Force Model, it also comes with the potential of additional federal funding for the participating communities.

""This carries so much legal liability for the municipality. It can be extremely costly and has really negative consequences for Michigan residents who live, work, or travel through those communities,"" said Christine Sauvé, policy, engagement, and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC).

Last week, dozens of residents spoke out against the agreement during a city council meeting, voicing their concerns over how this could endanger innocent people.

Immigrant rights advocates say the agreement goes beyond that, with some calling it a dangerous step toward racial profiling and unnecessary violence.

""This impacts beyond just Center Line, and my biggest concern was that this was a blueprint for other cities to follow suit,"" said Katrina Manetta, executive director of Macomb Defenders Rising.

""If Center Line were able to get away with this, then maybe Detroit would be able to get away with this, which is an even bigger city with even bigger implications.""

Center Line's public safety director later announced the city would be withdrawing its agreement, putting out a statement saying, the city ""had no intent to participate in any ICE enforcement activities in direct partnership with ICE agents, such as raids on businesses or resident's homes, as the city does not have the resources for that sort of activity.""

This is the second agency to drop its agreement with ICE in the last month.

The Metro Police Authority of Genesee County, a multi-jurisdictional police agency, cancelled its agreement with ICE on Oct. 22. The agency first entered into the agreement in July.

CBS News Detroit dug deeper and found that seven other agencies are still under their own agreements, pushing organizations to continue advocating for their removal.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.

end of list

The Associated Press (AP) news agency obtained internal documents explaining the policy change from four independent sources, including one current and two former TSA workers.

Those documents explain that “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveller’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.

Until February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.

Although transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.

A transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.

“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.

Mittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.

TSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.

The legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.

Other transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.

Kai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.

Worried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.

Regan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.

“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.

Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.

“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.

The DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.

“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”

Airport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.

Travellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.

Deciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.

“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.

The TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.

For passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.

The documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.

But the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.

According to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.

“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”

Being unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.

It adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.

American Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.

“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101027125245133833_20.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-11 21:02:37.524729

Ms. Shaheen noted that Transparency International, a research group, ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption.
Equatorial Guinea was one of them.
In her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country.
The ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.","A Democratic senator has criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio for paying $7.5 million to the government of Equatorial Guinea to agree to take deportees from the United States who are not its citizens.

The senator, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Mr. Rubio on Monday saying that the “highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”

The $7.5 million is by far the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees who are not its citizens.

Ms. Shaheen noted that Transparency International, a research group, ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption. And the State Department itself said in its 2023 human rights report that the country’s “president and members of his inner circle continued to amass personal fortunes from the revenues associated with monopolies on all domestic commercial ventures” and that “corruption at all levels of government was a severe problem.”

A State Department report from 2025 on human trafficking pointed to multiple “credible sources” who had said government officials were involved in trafficking, including for sex.

“I have serious concerns over whether, without appropriate oversight mechanisms and guardrails, a direct payment to Equatorial Guinea’s government could be used to facilitate human trafficking,” Ms. Shaheen wrote. “I am also concerned about what protections are in place to ensure that third-country nationals removed to Equatorial Guinea are themselves not vulnerable to human trafficking, smuggling or human rights abuses.”

When asked about Ms. Shaheen’s statements, the State Department declined to comment on its arrangement with Equatorial Guinea, saying it did not want to reveal details of “diplomatic communications with other governments.”

“Implementing the Trump administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said in a statement. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

In one of its most contentious policies, the Trump administration has aggressively tried to deport a wide range of immigrants from the United States. Mr. Rubio has ordered diplomats to try to forge agreements with other nations to take deportees who are not their citizens.

A New York Times investigation that was based mostly on reviews of U.S. diplomatic cables and other federal documents found that, as of June, American officials had approached at least 58 governments about this effort. Many of the nations that were asked to take deportees had records of persistent human rights abuses and torture. Equatorial Guinea was one of them.

The State Department has agreed to make large payments in some cases. It paid Rwanda $100,000 to take an Iraqi man and was discussing further arrangements with the country. Most notably, it agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million to take up to 300 deportees whom the Trump administration accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, according to a court filing.

The men, at least some of whom had no clear ties to any gang, were put into a notorious prison. The Times found many suffered physical and mental abuse there.

In her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country. Over the past two administrations, the most aid money the United States ever gave to the country was $2 million in a year. The most given in one year by the first Trump administration was $780,000. The current amount given exceeds the sum of the past eight years of payments.

And in previous years, the United States did not give the aid directly to the government, with the exception of limited medical supplies. It sent the assistance to vetted partners that included nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations.

The $7.5 million payment is from a fund set up by Congress for the U.S. government to help with migrant and refugee issues, and specifically to help resettle those in need.

The ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.

Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the president and a vice president who is the expected successor, was convicted by a French court in 2017 of embezzling millions of dollars of public money that allowed him to lead a lavish lifestyle in Paris. The court imposed a suspended prison sentence of three years and a suspended fine of 30 million euros, or about $35 million.

On Sept. 29, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, met with Mr. Obiang Mangue in Washington after the State Department had given him a waiver on corruption sanctions to travel to the United States during the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. The State Department said the two officials “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration and advance security cooperation.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/11/multimedia/11dc-rubio-deportations-qcph/11dc-rubio-deportations-qcph-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:57:09.023612

It was the highest one-day total in Salem in many years, according to a statement from the coalition of more than 100 organizations.

People made several posts on social media about enforcement activity focused on northeast Salem throughout the morning.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment from the Statesman Journal.

“These were Oregonians taken from the heart of Salem’s close-knit Latino community,” said Reyna Lopez, president and executive director of PCUN, Oregon’s farmworker union. “This is where I grew up. It's a vibrant and strong Latino community. We are heartbroken today.""

Lopez said that at least nine of the detainees were farmworkers. Oregon for All said witnesses also reported that ICE rammed one car on Ward Drive.

ICE activity in the Mid-Willamette Valley has ramped up in recent weeks as the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration continues.

Oregon for All said more than 300 people across Oregon were detained in October. At least 35 people were arrested in Woodburn on Oct. 30. The number represents only the arrests confirmed and tracked directly through advocates' Rapid Response Network.

Salem City Councilor Mai Vang posted on Facebook about the activity in Ward 6. Vang encouraged residents to report ICE activity to the PIRC hotline (888-622-1510) and to reach out to the Equity Corps of Oregon for legal assistance relating to immigration.

""Salem Police Chief Trevor Womack has affirmed that Salem Police Department do not work to assist ICE. To do so is unlawful in Oregon,"" Vang wrote. ""I disavow the numerous ways this federal presence creates terror and chaos in our community. Please be vigilant and look out for our neighbors today.""

Salem Police Sgt. and spokesperson Jonathan Hardy said the agency was aware of two incidents involving ICE on Nov. 11.

Hardy said officers responded to a call at Portland Road and Ward Drive NE involving an unoccupied vehicle in the roadway. The car was towed, and Salem Police later confirmed it was connected to ICE activity.

Hardy said the second incident involved a report after the fact by federal agents about a disturbance near the 4500 block of Portland Road NE. Hardy said federal agents turned in a set of keys and a wallet belonging to a woman involved with the disturbance. Officers have made attempts to return the items to her, he said.

A video posted on social media by Erika Villa, who goes by La Vakerita online, seemed to show the disturbance. Villa, livestreaming herself following ICE agents as they drove through the area, said she had received reports of ICE activity and traveled to Salem to document any arrests.

""I just didn't want to see another person getting stopped and pulled over for no reason and getting arrested,"" Villa told the Statesman Journal.

Villa said she followed one vehicle she suspected belonged to ICE agents after asking them to identify themselves when she spotted them at a McDonald's.

After following the Dodge Charger with California plates, both vehicles stopped on Portland Road.

Villa recorded as one man, wearing a black baseball cap and black hoodie, exited the car she had been following and reached into the vehicle, removed a firearm, and walked toward her.

The other man is briefly seen reaching inside her vehicle and appears to remove keys from her ignition. Villa begins to scream that the agents have taken her wallet and keys and yells for others to call the police. Both men returned to the Dodge and left.

After the ruling was partially upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump filed an emergency appeal of the lower court block to the Supreme Court.
As in Chicago, Trump never attempted to send regular armed forces to Portland before he announced a deployment of the Guard.
The ruling marked the first time a federal judge permanently blocked one of Trump’s military interventions in a major Democratic-led city.
The block to Trump’s Chicago deployment will likely remain in place over the coming days.","President Donald Trump has broad unreviewable powers to flood U.S. cities with National Guard troops, the Department of Justice (DOJ) argued in an expansive new filing to the Supreme Court.

The letter, filed by Solicitor General D. John Sauer late Monday, marked the latest step in Trump’s authoritarian effort to militarize cities and to integrate soldiers into routine policing.

The filing was made as part of the Supreme Court’s request for additional briefing on the legality of Trump’s attempted military deployment in Chicago. Trump attempted to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard troops and deploy them into Chicago earlier this year, claiming they were needed to protect federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations in the city as part of this mass deportation agenda.

The aggressive raids have ignited widespread but largely peaceful protests from residents, particularly outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb around 12 miles west of Chicago.

A district court temporarily halted Trump’s Windy City deployment last month. After the ruling was partially upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump filed an emergency appeal of the lower court block to the Supreme Court.

In a surprise move, the high court said before it acted on Trump’s appeal that it needed more information on 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), the archaic law the president has repeatedly invoked this year to take control of thousands Guard soldiers.

The rarely used statute allows the president to federalize Guard troops — which are normally under state control — when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or, operative here to the Supreme Court’s inquiry, when the president is unable to execute laws with “regular forces.”

The Supreme Court asked Trump and Illinois, which is challenging the Chicago deployment, to answer whether “regular forces” in the relevant clause refers to the traditional forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The court’s question appeared to be prompted by Martin Lederman, a former DOJ deputy assistant attorney general who’s now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. Lederman argued in an amicus brief that throughout U.S. history, and the specific legal history of Title 10, the phrase “regular forces” has always referred to the armed forces.

Filing on behalf of Trump Monday, Sauer asserted that the phrase does not refer to the standing military but instead to the “civilian forces that regularly ‘execute the laws’ at issue but are ‘unable’ to do so in present circumstances.”

While Sauer claimed that traditional armed forces generally cannot enforce federal law, he at the same time contended that the president has broad authority to deploy the formal military domestically.

“To be sure, the standing military was undoubtedly an available option to quash the violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement,” Sauer claimed of protests in Chicago, without specifying what authority Trump would have used to do so.

Trump, Sauer claimed, may have chosen not to deploy the formal military to Chicago because doing so “would result in even more strident resistance” from residents.

Sauer also claimed that Guard troops, with their “greater local knowledge, ties to the community, and domestic focus,” are likely better suited than traditional soldiers to suppressing “violent resistance on the streets of American cities.” That argument, however, is hard to square with Trump’s attempt to send hundreds of federalized Texas National Guard troops to Chicago.

A large part of Sauer’s letter wasn’t devoted to addressing the Supreme Court’s regular forces question but instead arguing that courts have no authority to question the president’s ability to deploy troops domestically.

“The President’s determination to call up the National Guard is a core exercise of his power as Commander in Chief over military affairs, based on an explicit delegation from Congress,” Sauer said. “That determination is not judicially reviewable at all; at minimum, it is entitled to extremely deferential review, under which it should be upheld.”

The DOJ has repeatedly claimed courts cannot review Trump’s deployments — even after a panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument in a ruling on his military intervention in Los Angeles earlier this year.

In its brief, Illinois adopted Lederman’s argument that “regular forces” refers to the normal armed forces. Because he never attempted to use traditional soldiers to assist or protect federal immigration agents in Chicago, Trump couldn’t have determined that he was unable to execute federal law and therefore lacked the authority to federalize the Guard, the state argued in its letter.

“Because ‘the regular forces’ refers to the full-time, professional military, the President may federalize and deploy the National Guard under [Title 10] only in circumstances where he is unable to execute federal law with the military,” Illinois said.

“These circumstances are not met here,” it added while asking the court to deny Trump’s emergency request.

If the Supreme Court ultimately adopts Illinois’ argument, legal experts have noted it could undermine Trump’s Chicago deployment, as well as his attempt to send Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

As in Chicago, Trump never attempted to send regular armed forces to Portland before he announced a deployment of the Guard.

A district court judge permanently blocked Trump’s Portland deployment last week after finding that it violated both the U.S. Constitution and Title 10. The ruling marked the first time a federal judge permanently blocked one of Trump’s military interventions in a major Democratic-led city.

Only in Los Angeles did Trump dispatch members of the traditional armed forces. He sent around 200 Marines in response to protests against immigration raids, but he did so while simultaneously deploying thousands of federalized members of the California Guard.

Alongside Sauer’s and Illinois’ letters, several groups asked the Supreme Court in briefs to deny Trump’s emergency appeal.

In one brief, the ACLU, the Knight First Amendment Institute and other civil rights organizations said Trump’s decision to deploy troops in response to demonstrations against the government were “incompatible with our nation’s ideals and threaten to suppress countless Americans’ exercise of First Amendment rights.”

In another, two dozen former federal judges supported a rejection of Trump’s appeal in order to preserve the judiciary’s authority to determine when a president has exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority.

The block to Trump’s Chicago deployment will likely remain in place over the coming days. The court gave Trump and Illinois until Nov. 17 to file reply briefs, and it likely will not rule on its regular forces question until those are submitted.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2239825292-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 18:02:01.211370

In June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.
Immigration officials said they were targeting immigrants who were given commercial driver’s licenses by “sanctuary states,” including Illinois.
In immigration court in Denver, “he had already complied with all of his obligations,” Guevara said.
An ICE spokesperson, contacted via email, said immigration officials had read The Sun’s initial story about Dadfar and “have nothing to add.” They provided no other comment.","Colorado Democrats are calling on federal immigration authorities to release an Afghan immigrant who helped U.S. troops fight the Taliban before moving to Boulder County, calling his treatment “cruel and inhumane.”

Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who worked in the Afghan Army for 14 years and provided security for U.S. soldiers, was detained during an ICE sting in Indiana as he drove through the Midwest while working as a long-haul truck driver. He has been in a Missouri detention center for nearly a month.

Dadfar had been granted humanitarian parole because it was too dangerous for him to return to his home country and he was seeking asylum through regular appearances in immigration court, according to his Longmont attorney, Tiago Guevara.

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder County, called the actions of federal immigration officials “deplorable.” Neguse’s office has spoken to Dadfar’s attorney and will help try to secure his release, he said.

“The detainment of Mohammad Dadfar — an Afghan ally who risked his life alongside American troops to fight the Taliban — is a disgrace, and yet another example of this administration’s draconian immigration policies,” Neguse said in an emailed statement. “My office is in touch directly with Mr. Dadfar’s legal counsel, and we are committed to taking all legal steps to ensure his safety and secure his release.”

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a former Army Ranger and who served in Afghanistan, said he “might not be here today” without the Afghans who served alongside him during combat tours in Afghanistan.

“After the war, we promised we’d have their back,” he said via email. “Our word must be our bond, but Donald Trump is threatening to break it once again. When America breaks our promises, especially to our friends, it makes us less safe.”

Crow last summer reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would create a pathway for lawful permanent status for tens of thousands of Afghans who are currently in the United States.

Dadfar fled Afghanistan in 2021, after U.S. troops had withdrawn and the Taliban returned to power. Fearing for his life, he traveled with his wife and four children first to Iran, and then to Brazil when the Brazilian government offered visas to Afghan refugees. After about a year in South America, the family made a treacherous journey through the jungle of the Darien Gap to reach the U.S. border.

They arrived at the border in the summer of 2024 and were allowed to enter the country based on their claims for asylum. They settled in Louisville, where Dadfar’s brother already lived.

Dadfar had received humanitarian parole, a temporary immigration status that allows people facing urgent humanitarian crises to enter the country legally. The status was granted to 30,000 people from Hungary in the 1950s after the Soviet Union crushed Hungary’s anti-Communist revolution. It has been given to people fleeing persecution in Cuba and Vietnam, and more recently, to Ukrainians after the Russian invasion and Afghans after Kabul fell back into the hands of the Taliban in 2021.

In June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. That followed a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May granting an emergency request from the Trump administration to terminate parole for more than 530,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the country under the Biden administration.

Dadfar, who had been working as a truck driver for only a few weeks, was caught up in what ICE officials are calling “Operation Midway Blitz,” a Chicago-based effort to prevent “alien threats to public safety.”

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said 223 people were taken into custody in a “successful operation” with the Indiana State Police targeting truck drivers near the Illinois state line. Immigration officials said they were targeting immigrants who were given commercial driver’s licenses by “sanctuary states,” including Illinois.

Dadfar has not been accused of a crime. He had a permit that authorized him to work in the United States, his attorney said.

In immigration court in Denver, “he had already complied with all of his obligations,” Guevara said. “He was just waiting for a final hearing date.”

Guevara has asked the court to transfer Dadfar’s new immigration case from Missouri to Denver so he can be closer to his family and lawyer. He is awaiting a judge’s ruling.

An ICE spokesperson, contacted via email, said immigration officials had read The Sun’s initial story about Dadfar and “have nothing to add.” They provided no other comment.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9535.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 19:57:29.149006

The rule Calling it a “national emergency,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an interim final rule in late September to get a handle on states issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers.
The rule, which took effect immediately, made it so that an Employee Authorization Document (EAD) was no longer enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL.
FMCSA estimated that the changes would take 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry.
“OOIDA and truckers across America support the Trump administration’s action to restore integrity to the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said.","An emergency interim final rule to clean up the non-domiciled CDL system has been paused by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

On Monday, Nov. 10, the court ordered that the rule, which was expected to remove about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry, be “administratively stayed” pending further order of the court.

“The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motions for stay pending review and should not be construed in any way as ruling on the merits of those motions,” the court wrote on Nov. 10.

The rule

Calling it a “national emergency,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an interim final rule in late September to get a handle on states issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers. Following an audit, Duffy said the DOT determined that many of these CDLs were issued to drivers who were in the country illegally or for a period exceeding the time they were authorized to work in the United States.

The rule, which took effect immediately, made it so that an Employee Authorization Document (EAD) was no longer enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL. Additionally, asylum seekers, asylees, refugees and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would be excluded from eligibility. FMCSA estimated that the changes would take 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry. At the same time, many of those same individuals would remain eligible for other employment in the U.S.

Although the rule was made effective immediately, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is continuing to accept comments through Nov. 28. As of Nov. 11, nearly 4,900 comments had been submitted.

The lawsuit

In October, a lawsuit was filed, saying that the rule would have “devastating consequences” for hundreds of thousands of CDL holders.

The lawsuit was filed on Oct. 20 by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in a news release. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

On Oct. 24, the groups filed an emergency motion to stay the rule while the litigation is ongoing.

The plaintiffs said that FMCSA did not justify its decision to make the rule effective before going through a typical rulemaking process.

“FMCSA does not meaningfully contest that the factual evidence it cited does not demonstrate an emergency,” the plaintiffs wrote. “And FMCSA has expressly disclaimed ‘a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.’”

The agency argued that much of the danger surrounding issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers is that there is no way to review their driving records.

“Without a verified driving record, there is a serious risk that unsafe or high-risk drivers – who may have prior violations, suspensions or a history of crashes in foreign jurisdictions – could be granted non-domiciled CDLs and operate large trucks and buses on U.S. roadways,” attorneys for FMCSA wrote in the Oct. 31 response brief. “Thus, limiting the eligibility of classes of potential applicants whose driving history cannot be ascertained will increase safety by appreciably reducing the number of non-domiciled CDL drivers with unknown driver safety records on the nation’s highways.”

Reaction

The FMCSA did not immediately respond to Land Line’s request for comment.

The Public Citizen Litigation Group offered the following statement:

“The court’s order gives drivers across the country a chance to continue working and supporting their families and communities,” Liu wrote. “We understand that FMCSA will inform state licensing agencies tomorrow morning about the stay, so that they know that FMCSA’s rule is not in effect and should not be applied. We are glad that the court put FMCSA’s unlawful rule on hold temporarily, and we hope that the court will continue to put the rule on hold while the lawsuit proceeds.”

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said it supports FMCSA’s efforts to close loopholes in the non-domiciled CDL program.

“OOIDA and truckers across America support the Trump administration’s action to restore integrity to the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said. “For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk.”

The Association added that the lawsuit over how the rule was issued is reason to support Rep. David Rouzer’s Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would codify the interim final rule into law.

Under the agreement, the Israeli military currently controls a little over half of the Gaza strip, including the southern city of Rafah and parts of Gaza City.
Nearly 2 million residents of the Gaza strip are crammed into tent camps in the sections controlled by Hamas.","The U.S. federal government shutdown has entered its 42nd day. On Monday night, a group of seven democratic senators ratified a deal with republican senators to approve a bill to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The bill notably does not include an extension of the affordable care act subsidies, though Senate majority leader John Thune has agreed to a separate vote on them. The measure now heads to the House, which has not been in session since mid-September. The House vote on the spending package could come as early as Wednesday afternoon. Independent senator Bernie Sanders called the vote a “horrific mistake.” Meanwhile, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to stand firm on the issue of healthcare subsidies.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “We’re not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people. And we’re going to continue the fight to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And if it doesn’t happen this week, next week, this month, next month, then it’s the fault of Donald Trump, House and Senate Republicans who continue to make life more expensive for the American people.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration again informed the Supreme Court that it wants to prevent a lower court ruling requiring full food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to be disbursed in November. 1 in 8 people in the U.S. rely on SNAP for food assistance. This is Toni Miller, at a food bank in Phoenix, Arizona.

Toni Miller: “Trump is a joke. He’s a joke. I work hard, but those little stamps that we get? It helps out, and he’s starving the American people. I know he had lost a lot of supporters. He’s a joke.”

Syria’s President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met with President Trump at the White House yesterday. It was the first visit by a Syrian President to Washington in history, and it comes just days after the U.S. said Al-Sharaa was no longer a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.” Al-Sharaa once had a $10 million bounty on his head, and was jailed by U.S. forces as an insurgent in Iraq from 2005-2011. He was also the leader of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was formerly al-Qaeda’s official wing in Syria before breaking off in 2016. In the Oval Office, President Trump promised sanctions relief for Syria and commented on the historic nature of his meeting with Al-Sharaa.

President Trump: “We want to see Syria become a country that’s very successful and I think this leader can do it. I really do. I think this leader can do it. And people said he’s had a rough past. We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”

European officials speaking to Reuters have expressed concern that the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal was effectively stalled and that reconstruction was increasingly unlikely. It comes as Israel continues to violate the U.S.-brokered truce, killing at least 242 Palestinians and injuring 622 since the deal came into effect on October 10th. Under the agreement, the Israeli military currently controls a little over half of the Gaza strip, including the southern city of Rafah and parts of Gaza City. Nearly 2 million residents of the Gaza strip are crammed into tent camps in the sections controlled by Hamas. This is Hamas’s spokesperson Hazem Qassam calling for the reconstruction phase to begin.

Hamas Spokesperson Hazem Qasem: “We are clearly saying that Hamas won’t be in the picture of ruling the Gaza Strip during the next day, and this has been agreed upon. There will be a social support committee from independent people which will rule everything in the strip. Therefore, we are working on removing all the excuses put by all sides to prevent reconstruction. All the regions of Gaza deserve reconstruction equally. Hamas is ready to hand in power from now, in a way that the process of the Gaza Strip’s reconstruction starts, and this is a right of the people of the Gaza Strip.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced yesterday that the U.S. military killed six people on Sunday in two more strikes on boats in the eastern Pacific. Since early September, the Pentagon has claimed responsibility for 19 attacks on boats the U.S. has said, without evidence, are carrying drugs in the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, killing 76 people. The strikes come as the Pentagon is deploying its largest warship, the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, to join a buildup of U.S. forces in the Caribbean this week.

In more Supreme Court news, the private prison company Geo Group is seeking immunity from a lawsuit filed by more than 30,000 former detainees of an ICE jail in Colorado who say they were coerced into participating in a $1-a-day detainee work program. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday in the case, with several Supreme Court justices appearing skeptical of Geo Group’s position. Geo Group is claiming “sovereign immunity”–the protection provided to the government from lawsuits–because it was operating under a government contract. The Geo Group is opening more detention centers nationwide, and received more than half of its $2.4 billion revenue from federal contracts.

British journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi is set to be released from ICE custody according to his lawyer. Hamdi was detained by ICE agents last month at San Francisco International Airport while he was on a speaking tour in the U.S on a valid visitor visa. His visa was later revoked without his knowledge.Hamdi is an outspoken advocate for Palestinian rights. The CEO of CAIR-California, Hussam Ayloush said, “Sami’s case shows how quickly our government officials are willing to sacrifice our First Amendment and free press when a journalist uses his platform to dare put America first before Israel.”

A whistleblower has told House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell is seeking a commutation of her 20-year sentence from President Trump. That’s according to Maxwell’s email to her attorney reviewed by NBC News, with the subject line “commutation application.” The whistleblower also reportedly detailed Maxwell’s “concierge-style” treatment at the minimum security prison camp that she was transferred to. In response, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin wrote a letter to President Trump quote, “You should not grant any form of clemency to this convicted and unrepentant sex offender. Your Administration should not be providing her with room service, with puppies to play with, with federal law enforcement officials waiting on her every need, or with any special treatment or institutional privilege at all.”

In Pakistan, at least 12 people were killed and several injured after a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a busy judicial complex in Islamabad. Government officials are investigating it as a suicide attack. Pakistan’s Defense Minister said on X Pakistan is in a “state of war.” Witnesses of the bombing described the chaotic scene.

Eyewitness Rustam Malik: “It was 30 to 35 minutes since we parked our vehicles and entered the gate, then there was a loud explosion. It was a big blast. There was fire all over. Body parts were strewn. There was chaos. Then police and security personnel came. It was a big explosion. It looked like a bomb blast.”

In Ecuador, at least 31 people were found dead in a prison in the city of Machala, including over two dozen prisoners who had been hanged. This came just hours after prison guards found another four people killed. Authorities have blamed the deaths on clashes between gangs, as human rights groups sound the alarm on overcrowded and dangerous conditions inside Ecuadoran prisons, causing a series of recent deadly attacks and riots. Meanwhile relatives of those inside have repeatedly urged authorities to step up security and to detain rival gangs separately.

ICE agents last Wednesday also detained for a time Juanita Avila, a local business owner.

Avila’s daughter, Emely, told the crowd Monday about her mother’s ordeal. In an interview last week with Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Avila said she was pulled over, yanked from her minivan and then thrown to the street despite having permanent resident status.

Videos shared on social media showed Avila on the ground, yelling, and then her daughter arriving and frantically telling ICE officers of her mother’s legal status.

“My mother was not stopped because they were looking for a specific person, not because they had a warrant and not because they had reasonable suspicion, but because she was Latina and driving a van,” Emely Agustin said Monday.

Agustin told the crowd her mother was not interfering with ICE but “simply driving.”

“They were stopping people of color driving to work in vans and trucks. They didn’t identify themselves as ‘Immigration’ until after they threw her to the ground and were kneeling on top of her, putting her in handcuffs,” Agustin said.

Her mother actually had her “green card” in her pocket, but “they never once asked for it or her ID,” Agustin said. Permanent resident status, often referred to as having a “green card,” allows a person to live and work in the United States, though they are not U.S. citizens.

“After I insisted she was a legal resident, even then, they kept asking me if it was valid, expired or even real … They were trying to belittle me into giving up trying to get her released,” Agustin said.

“Every time we go out and we see a semi-suspicious vehicle, our hearts start racing. However, we consider ourselves lucky to be able to still be together as a family while others are separated and crying for the chance to see their loved ones again,” Agustin said, standing next to her mother.

Juanita Avila spoke briefly to thank the crowd for showing support and also her daughter.

“Because if she wasn’t there that day, they would have taken me, and I have a little one at home,” Avila said.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle also addressed the crowd.

“Juanita, we know, is part of our community. She is the best of the best, and never got the opportunity to show her ‘Green Card,’ which she had with her. Thank goodness, her daughter was there,” said Hoyle, a Democrat who represents the 4th Congressional District, which includes Cottage Grove.

She said her office would host “Know Your Rights” sessions to explain the legal rights of those stopped by ICE or otherwise encountering ICE agents.

“What’s happening in Cottage Grove is happening all around the country, and it is up to us to not back down. And it is scary, but it is less scary for us than it is for our immigrant neighbors,” Hoyle said.

In the mostly Anglo crowd, Chris Stuehm, 33, said he came to the vigil to show he doesn’t agree with the ICE tactics. A Cottage Grove resident, he said he was surprised to hear about the ICE arrests in his community.

“This is America,” Stuehm said, adding that people should feel welcome and have a path to citizenship.

“We shouldn’t just be taking people by the way they look, and arresting them and finding out that they’re legal and there’s no warrant for them, to let them go. What’s next?”

Ruth Seeger, 65, said she traveled from Eugene to attend the candlelight vigil after hearing from friends in Cottage Grove about the event.

Asked her thoughts on the ICE enforcement activity, Seeger said, “If it can happen in rural Cottage Grove, then no one is really safe.”

Carrillo last week told Lookout Eugene-Springfield that some of those detained by ICE in Cottage Grove had pending asylum applications, and he spoke to the crowd on Monday about seeking asylum as a “human right.”

The asylum application process is for those seeking protection in the United States because they fear persecution in their home countries.

“People have a right to escape violent regimes and criminal gangs in their lives and to seek safety in another country,” said Carrillo, who told the crowd he graduated from high school in 2019 after arriving in the United States from Guatemala as a teenager. His family went through the asylum process, he said.

This comes after a boat carrying 90 Rohingya refugees and migrants reportedly sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia, with at least 25 people perished.

Amnesty International’s Myanmar Researcher Joe Freeman said:

This latest tragedy at sea in Southeast Asia once again lays bare the deadly risks faced by Rohingya Muslims who attempt to flee conflict and persecution in Myanmar, plus deteriorating conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

Freeman also urged the Malaysian and Thai governments to coordinate humanitarian assistance for the survivors of the tragedy and to refrain from forcibly returning them to Myanmar. He additionally called on the ASEAN leaders to address the long-standing issue of Rohingya boats at sea and the conflict in Myanmar.

Freeman further highlighted other worsening conditions, such as food shortages, forced labour, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on movement, faced by the Rohingya community in Myanmar.

The US funding cuts have further exacerbated the situation of the Rohingya community in Bangladesh camps, with shortages in shelter and education services. These conditions, Freeman said, have led the refugees to resort to the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.

According to Malaysian police, the rescue operation for another two boats, which also reportedly carried Rohingya refugees, is underway. The police have also opened an investigation under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 against those who have been rescued thus far. It is an offence under Section 6 of the Act to enter Malaysia without a valid permit or entry pass.

This is not an isolated incident, as recently two boats carrying around 300 Rohingya refugees were turned away by the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). Moreover, according to local media, the MMEA has detained 1,333 undocumented migrants off the coast of Langkawi and Kedah between 2020 and October 2025.

Notably, there are 117,670 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the UNHCR in Malaysia as of May. Meanwhile, Malaysia has not ratified the UNHCR Convention, despite calls from the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam).

The government, however, proposed, in February, to review the National Security Council (NSC) Directive No.23 to recognize the refugees’ right to work.

UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration(IOM) have also issued a joint statement, expressing their concern over the latest tragedy and emphasizing the duty of states under international maritime law to protect those in distress at sea.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/Ambassador_Miller_visited_Rohingya_Refugee_Camps_in_Coxs_Bazar_46365456711-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 17:01:02.086807

In Kane County, a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in Kane County and calling on the state and federal government to reform immigration procedures — but not banning immigration enforcement on county property — was brought forward by board member Myrna Molina and considered by the board’s Legislative Committee in late October.
For example, at the Kane County Board Executive Committee meeting last week, board member Leslie Juby said the resolution is reaffirming the county’s commitments to its residents, and that that is its job.
And board member Mohammad Iqbal said there were “so many defects” in the measure that was ultimately passed by the board.
But Kane County Board Chair Corinne Pierog said the proposal “doesn’t share values, it requests action.” mmorrow@chicagotribune.com","As President Donald Trump’s federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs enters its third month, the Kane County Board on Monday gave final approval to a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in the county and calling on the state and federal government to prohibit immigration enforcement at sensitive locations and enact immigration reforms.

The board is also discussing a ban on civil immigration enforcement actions on county-owned property.

Since the Trump administration’s surge of immigration law enforcement in Chicago — dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” — began in September, hundreds have been arrested, thousands have protested across Chicago and the suburbs and numerous cities and counties have considered or passed local legislation aiming to address the ongoing immigration crackdown.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established Chicago city property as “ICE-free” zones in early October, and municipalities like Evanston, Waukegan, Carpentersville and Elgin have followed suit with similar measures. Cook, Will and Lake counties, too, have prohibited federal immigration enforcement actions on their property.

In Kane County, a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in Kane County and calling on the state and federal government to reform immigration procedures — but not banning immigration enforcement on county property — was brought forward by board member Myrna Molina and considered by the board’s Legislative Committee in late October.

It has since generated discussion among board members about what the resolution does and the county’s part in it.

For example, at the Kane County Board Executive Committee meeting last week, board member Leslie Juby said the resolution is reaffirming the county’s commitments to its residents, and that that is its job. She said she doesn’t understand why the county committing to providing services “in a fair, equitable and culturally responsive manner to all residents,” as the resolution states, “would be a point of contention for anyone.”

“We’re asking the state of Illinois and the federal government to do something, because we recognize that, as Kane County Board members, we do not have the purview to do that,” Juby said. “While I understand it looks like it’s symbolic only, we’re doing everything that we are allowed to do in our capacity.”

Board member Clifford Surges said the resolution “looks awfully much like a proclamation,” rather than an actionable request, and said the county’s proclamations have gotten “more and more political.”

Board member Michelle Gumz, on the other hand, said the resolution requests action of state and federal elected officials. And board member Mavis Bates said it was the job of the Legislative Committee to send directives to the legislature about the county’s priorities.

After ultimately being recommended by the Executive Committee last week, the matter came to the full board for final approval on Monday, where it again generated a mix of opinions among the board.

Board member David Young, for example, criticized the way the federal immigration crackdown is being talked about, saying that claiming federal agents “are literally ripping people out of their homes” is “putting a target on these agents that are just doing their job.”

“That rhetoric, I think, just has to stop,” Young said. “And this resolution actually does that. It actually goes ahead and, I think, puts a target … on the back of those ICE agents that are just doing their job.”

He also said that the current immigration enforcement actions going on are “being done based upon our Constitution,” and suggested that, under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which dictates that federal law takes priority over conflicting state laws, this resolution could open the county up to a lawsuit from the federal government.

Board member Jon Gripe took issue with what he said was the “condemnation of an entire group of law enforcement officers.” Gripe previously attempted to add an amendment to the measure expressing support for law enforcement officers, but it failed to get sufficient support from the Legislative Committee.

And board member Mohammad Iqbal said there were “so many defects” in the measure that was ultimately passed by the board.

Iqbal said the term “human dignity” in the measure is “ambiguous” and that, despite the title indicating “fair reform,” the resolution doesn’t propose reform in the county. He also criticized the resolution’s calling on the state of Illinois to enact reform because the federal government handles immigration enforcement, not states, and said that the resolution’s request to “ensure no person is detained or deported based on racial or ethnic profiling” is already in the law.

“The committee should re-look at it,” Iqbal said. “They’re putting too much into this resolution. If there’s only one thing they want to say, prohibit immigration enforcement in a sensitive location such as school, places of worship or community centers, that’s probably reasonable.”

A number of other board members spoke in favor of the measure.

Board member Sonia Garcia spoke about the fear she sees in her community about the recent immigration enforcement operations.

“I can’t go ahead and be quiet on this,” Garcia said.

And Gumz, too, indicated support for the resolution in light of the fear she says she sees in her district as the federal immigration crackdown continues.

“I watch it with my own eyes,” Gumz said. “To act is something that I have to do.”

And board member Vern Tepe suggested that expressing support for human rights is necessary in the country right now.

“It’s the way that they’re treated, and it’s the amount of hate that seems to be prevalent throughout our society on … both sides,” Tepe said. “And the only way to stop it is to stand up for human rights and to realize that we have to work and point out those inequities that happen.”

Board member Michael Linder said that the way the immigration crackdown is being carried out is “not even what was intended,” saying that the surge of enforcement had been meant to “remove the criminals.” He said the country still needs to address illegal immigration, but “it’s not addressed by being inhuman(e).”

And Juby again pointed out that, though the county can’t enact immigration reform, it can advocate for changes at the state and federal levels.

“The things that we’re asking for them to do are not things in our control, but things that we believe in,” she said. “We believe that we should be humane and that we should have comprehensive immigration … reforms. We believe in due process. We believe in keeping families together. We recognize that everybody who comes here has value and contributes in one way or another. We’re asking for you not to sweep them out of churches and hospitals and schools. That’s not hard.”

Several residents also spoke both in favor of and against the measure during the meeting’s public comment period.

Ultimately, the measure passed in a split vote, with board members Gary Daugherty, Gripe, Iqbal, Bill Lenert, Bill Roth, Rick Williams and Young voting against it, and Surges abstaining.

With that measure passed, the board is also beginning to consider an ordinance prohibiting federal immigration agents from using county-owned property for enforcement actions like staging or processing, much like the legislation local municipalities around Chicago and its suburbs have enacted in recent weeks.

At Monday’s meeting, Molina said the request “comes from a deep concern for our community,” and said the intention of the proposed ordinance is to “ensure that every family in Kane County feels safe, respected and welcome in the places we all share.”

Kane County State’s Attorney Jamie Mosser, at the meeting, said it is her job to provide legal advice to the county board, not to draft policies. She said she would provide her assessment of what’s constitutional and what’s not out of what other municipalities have done in their legislation as the county considers proceeding with the proposed ordinance.

“I’m not a policy decision-maker, nor am I the one who’s supposed to write policy for you,” Mosser said. “I am more than happy that, once an ordinance is given to us, to review it.”

The proposed ordinance’s text was not presented on Monday, but Molina said she has drafted an ordinance and is seeking review and feedback from the state’s attorney.

Linder pointed out that the ordinance may not forbid anything not already prohibited by the state’s Trust Act, which generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from getting involved in deportation efforts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal policing agencies dealing with immigration matters.

And Gripe said he wants the State’s Attorney’s Office to provide insight on the matter, and expressed concern about the possibility of a lawsuit from the federal government over such an ordinance.

Young said the matter should become a proclamation, rather than an ordinance, suggesting that would reduce the legal risk for the county. But Kane County Board Chair Corinne Pierog said the proposal “doesn’t share values, it requests action.”

I agree with Kurt Vonnegut, who said: Armistice Day has become Veterans Day.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) helicopters will undoubtedly be circling my neighborhood looking for roofers and landscapers this “Veterans Day,” just as they have been for weeks. In the U.S., you’re an easy mark when you have brown skin and your job demands that you labor out in the open.

My town, located just outside of Chicago, has been crawling with ICE agents or soldiers (the terms deserve to be used interchangeably) for weeks now. Recently, two moms, in the cold with their whistles, helped guard a crew working on a roof that was damaged by hail in a recent storm. The ICE agents/soldiers, dressed in full military kit, carrying semi-automatic weapons, and wearing ski masks to hide their identity, are patrolling in unmarked trucks — I think we all know how to spot them at this point.

These people remind me of the soldiers I patrolled with in Afghanistan, only the average ICE agent has less training than the average soldier. It seems like every neighborhood in the U.S. is now subject to an armed and potentially violent confrontation with federal troops. The U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan has come full circle.

Similar to the way that I terrorized Afghan villages during my time in the military following 9/11, ICE has been terrorizing my town. When I was in the U.S. Army Rangers, we’d target high school and college-age Afghans. Most of the time, these kids were simply walking down the street, minding their own business, when they became subject to a search, an intimidating interrogation, or abduction. After a while, Afghans would alert their neighbors anytime our caravan of trucks entered a town — sometimes they would use whistles. Villagers would quickly disappear and it then felt like we were rolling through a ghost town. This, in part, is life under occupation.

The Trump Regime’s Skyrocketing Domestic Occupying Forces

ICE training has been cut by five weeks to “surge” the number of troops: Training is now eight weeks long, down from 13 weeks. The Trump administration hopes to increase the number of ICE agents from 6,500 nationwide to 10,000 by the end of 2025. A signing bonus of $50,000 has reportedly drawn 150,000 people to apply for positions with ICE, as the agency uses white nationalist imagery to attract white supremacist recruits.

ICE agents/soldiers are occupying U.S. neighborhoods with some of the deadliest weapons in the world with only eight weeks of training and no comparable past experience required. According to a former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official interviewed by NBC News, “[DHS is] trying to push everyone through, and the vetting process is not what it should be.” Yet, even if the vetting were more rigorous and thorough, no amount of training could justify armed soldiers terrorizing our neighbors.

My Ranger unit in the Army had some of the best-trained soldiers in the world in it. Still, we lost a soldier every six months or so to an accidental discharge of a weapon. A first sergeant in my unit, who was considered an extremely competent soldier, accidentally shot his M-4 rifle inside a Blackhawk helicopter. The first sergeant lost his rank and was booted from the Rangers.

Pat Tillman, the former professional football player who joined the military after 9/11, was also in my unit. He was killed in an act of “friendly fire” and his death was covered up all the way up George W. Bush’s chain of command.

The vast majority of those killed in the U.S.’s “global war on terror” after 9/11 were noncombatants. “Collateral damage” is what they call it. But in reality, these deaths should be defined by what they are: gross recklessness with deadly weapons and a general disregard for human life. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world died at the hands of U.S. soldiers and their leaders. Even the most well-trained military units can’t be trusted to do the right thing. The “global war on terror” proved this.

So when I see ICE and militarized police carrying assault rifles or weapons of any kind, I’m reminded how naive and foolish it is to trust those armed by the U.S government. It is becoming increasingly clear that ICE agents — dressed and equipped like soldiers — should not be allowed anywhere near our neighborhoods, especially armed with assault weapons.

In October, Chicago resident Miramar Martinez was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent here in Chicago. The yet-to-be-publicly-named masked agent fled to Maine immediately after the shooting. According to the local FOX news station, the masked man, moments before opening fire, aimed an assault rifle at Miramar and shouted: “Do something, b—h.”

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was shot and killed by an ICE agent/soldier in another suburb in Chicago in September.

In only the past few weeks we have seen far too many incidents that prove how dangerous this masked band of vigilantes is.

Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to make the National Guard complicit in this occupation: So far he has deployed troops to Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles,; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; and Memphis, Tennessee. He is threatening to deploy even more troops to Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, Oakland, San Francisco, and St. Louis. The Posse Comitatus Act prevents the National Guard from being deployed in a law enforcement capacity. But as Democracy Docket has documented, this 150-year-old law hasn’t stopped Trump, who has already been reprimanded by a federal judge who found that his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by “using troops to directly protect federal agents carrying out arrests, setting up perimeters and road blockades for law enforcement operations and, on at least two occasions, detained civilians.”

Morale is collapsing in the National Guard. Internal documents show that the Army is aware that their mission is unpopular; a snapshot from September found that only 2 percent of social media postings analyzed had a positive view of the National Guard’s deployment to Washington, D.C., while more than 53 percent of posts cast Trump’s orders negatively. This provides an opening to anyone hoping to convince National Guard members to lay their weapons down and resist Trump’s demands. These soldiers have a moral responsibility to refuse illegal orders. It’s our duty to remind them of this fact — something to consider the next time you’re at a protest or have an opportunity to talk to an active-duty guard member.

Veterans’ groups such as About Face, and Veterans for Peace are doing a phenomenal job encouraging National Guard members to resist Trump. The “Vets Say No” protests here in Chicago and other cities have drawn thousands to hear their message of resistance. These groups are reminding soldiers that they are not alone, that the U.S. has a proud tradition of refusing orders, and that courage and honor sometimes involves saying no to commanding officers.

Rejecting “Hero” Worship

In speaking with immigrants in my neighborhood, I know they are experiencing a similar fear to that felt by the Afghans I patrolled. I signed up for the military in February of 2002 thinking I would make the U.S. safer by helping to protect it from another 9/11-style attack. I learned that most of what the U.S. was doing in places like Afghanistan was making the world a more dangerous place: both by occupying territory where it didn’t belong, and by killing so many noncombatants — innocent civilians. Further, it was predictable that the uncritical hero worship of soldiers that we saw after 9/11 would breed a dangerous level of comfort with those who carried weapons on behalf of the U.S. government.

I grow more angry and frustrated with each passing “Veterans Day” — this is my 20th since leaving the U.S. Army Rangers as a conscientious objector — because it gets clearer and clearer that “Veterans Day” is nothing more than an attempt to bury the oppressive and deadly agenda of the U.S. ruling class by celebrating our “heroes.” Heroes don’t kill innocent civilians, prey on the marginalized, or participate in imperialist missions designed only to make rich people richer, do they? If you are carrying a weapon on behalf of the federal government in 2025, you are the opposite of a hero, in spite of your best intentions.

I never call it “Veterans Day.” I call it Armistice Day as we did in the years following World War I. Armistice Day was meant to celebrate an end to war, as opposed to Veterans Day, which seems intent on glorifying war. I agree with Kurt Vonnegut, who said:

Armistice Day has become Veterans Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans Day is not. So I will throw Veterans Day over my shoulder. Armistice Day I will keep. I don’t want to throw away any sacred things.

But in truth this day is more accurately described as “Occupiers Day” — a term that properly describes the threat that our communities inside and the U.S. face from all those who carry a weapon on behalf of the U.S. government.

Collectively, let’s see this day as an opportunity to maintain and accelerate the necessary pushback required to ward off the imperial mindset that has infected far too many in this country. No one is “illegal,” and only through abolishing ICE will we find safety for communities. We need to stop celebrating occupiers — both at home and abroad.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241666954-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 17:01:07.227240

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that on November 4 in Los Angeles, CA, ICE officers arrested Victoria Sorocean, an illegal alien from Moldova wanted in her home country for murder committed with premeditation and exceptional cruelty.

In September 2013, Sorocean and an accomplice were convicted of intentional murder, and she was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Sorocean and an accomplice tortured their victim in an apartment in Chisinau, Moldova. They beat the victim with a stick and electrical cable before throwing the victim out a ninth-floor window.

In an attempt to evade a 17-year prison sentence, Sorocean fled to the United States. Under the first Trump Administration, ICE arrested her on January 10, 2020. Following her arrest, Sorocean engaged in various legal tactics to avoid removal, including filing multiple appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals and seeking asylum.

In 2022, Sorocean was released back into the country under the Biden administration.

“It shocks the conscience that the Biden Administration released into America a cruel, violent illegal alien who tortured a human being, beat them with an electrical cable and a stick, and then threw her victim from a ninth-floor window,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These are the types of barbaric criminal illegal aliens ICE is targeting every single day. 70% of all ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. This does not even include foreign fugitives like this convicted murderer. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the world’s criminals are no longer welcome in the U.S.”

This case highlights the failures of the previous administration which allowed millions of illegal aliens, including violent criminals and murderers like Sorocean, to roam free in American neighborhoods.

ICE officers arrested Sorocean on November 4, 2025, and she will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Protesters left the area after the agents did, around 1 p.m. Tuesday.

It was unclear if any arrests were made by the federal authorities.

In a statement provided to ABC6 News, a Blount Fine Foods spokesperson said: “We heard that ICE was present on Water Street today and in the general vicinity of our plant. We did not have any communication with ICE agents and they did not enter our building. We’re monitoring the situation as you are. Our employees are a top priority to us at Blount.”

Warren police responded to the scene but only to assist with traffic control and keeping the peace, Lt. Marc Ferreira said.

Ferreira said Warren police did not make any arrests at the scene.

The jury also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll when he made comments in October 2022 denying her allegation.

In August, a New York appeals court threw out Trump’s staggering penalty in a state civil fraud lawsuit.","Donald Trump asked the US supreme court on Monday to throw out a jury’s finding in a civil lawsuit that he sexually abused writer E Jean Carroll at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s and later defamed her.

Trump’s lawyers argued in a lengthy filing with the high court that allegations leading to the $5m verdict were “propped up” by a “series of indefensible evidentiary rulings” that allowed Carroll’s lawyers to present “highly inflammatory propensity evidence” against him.

Carroll, a longtime advice columnist and former TV talkshow host, testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury retailer across the street from Trump Tower.

The jury also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll when he made comments in October 2022 denying her allegation.

Trump’s lawyers, led by Justin D Smith, a St Louis, Missouri-based attorney, , called Carroll’s claims a “politically motivated hoax”.

They accused the trial judge, Lewis A Kaplan, of warping federal evidence rules to bolster Carroll’s “implausible, unsubstantiated assertions”. They said by upholding the verdict, the second US circuit court of appeals was in conflict with other federal appeals courts on how such rules should be applied.

“President Trump has clearly and consistently denied that this supposed incident ever occurred,” Smith and his co-counsel wrote. “No physical or DNA evidence corroborates Carroll’s story. There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation.”

A message seeking comment was left with Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan.

In September, when Trump’s lawyers first indicated they would appeal to the supreme court, she said: “We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review by the United States supreme court.”

A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the supreme court appeal was part of the president’s crusade against “Liberal Lawfare”.

“The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,” the statement said.

A three-judge appellate panel upheld the verdict in December 2024, rejecting Trump’s claims Judge Kaplan’s decisions spoiled the trial, including by allowing two other Trump sexual abuse accusers to testify. The women said Trump committed similar acts against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denied all three women’s allegations.

In June, second circuit judges denied Trump’s petition for the full appellate court to take up the case. That left Trump with two options: accept the result and allow Carroll to collect the judgment, which he’d previously paid into escrow, or fight on in supreme court, whose conservative majority – including three of his own appointees – could be more open to considering his challenge.

Trump skipped the 2023 trial but testified briefly at a follow-up defamation trial last year that ended with a jury ordering him to pay Carroll an additional $83.3m. The second trial resulted from comments Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir.

Kaplan presided over both trials and instructed the second jury to accept the first jury’s finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Kaplan and Carroll’s lawyer, Kaplan, are not related.

In their supreme court filing, Trump’s lawyers said Kaplan compounded his “significant evidentiary errors” at first trial by “improperly preventing” Trump from contesting the first jury’s finding that he had sexually abused Carroll, leading to an “unjust judgment of $83.3m.”

The second circuit upheld that verdict on 8 September, with a three-judge panel calling the jury’s damages awards “fair and reasonable”. Trump has since asked the full appellate court to hear arguments and reconsider the ruling.

Trump has had recent success fending off costly civil judgments. In August, a New York appeals court threw out Trump’s staggering penalty in a state civil fraud lawsuit.

Last month, the Harris County Commissioners Court approved allocation of over $1 million for the county’s Immigrant Legal Services Fund. The program provides free legal representation to eligible immigrants who are in detention or facing the threat of deportation. It also provides counsel to children under 17 in Harris County who were previously detained in ORR shelters.

""We must stop the left-wing radicals who are robbing Texans to prevent illegals from being deported by the Trump Administration,” Paxton said in a statement. “Beyond just being blatantly unconstitutional, this is evil and wicked.""

The program was first proposed by County Judge Lina Hidalgo in 2020, in part, to improve due process in the federal immigration system, Houston Public Media reported.

“The goal is to provide attorneys for immigrants to be able to pursue their case,” Hidalgo said then. “If it turns out their case has no merit, and they're not to stay, that's fine. But they should have a shot at a fair process, and they can’t possibly navigate the system, a complicated, confusing system, without the legal support.”

The program was renewed in a 4-1 vote, with Tom Ramsey, the only Republican on the court, voting against it.

The money will be distributed to several nonprofit organizations, including BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, and Justice for All Immigrants. The funding will last through Dec. 31, 2026.

Paxton says the Texas Constitution prohibits governmental entities like Harris County from misusing public funds by giving gifts or conferring private benefits to individuals and groups ""that do not serve a legitimate public end.""

We reached out to Harris County for comment. A spokesperson said they are aware of the lawsuit and will release a response later today.

This is the latest in a flurry of lawsuits by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent John Cornyn and U.S Rep. Wesley Hunt, both fellow Republicans.

Bill Comes as Masked, Unidentifiable ICE Agents Use Tear Gas and Pepper Balls Against Non-Violent Journalists, Protestors, and Citizens

Read the Bill Here(link is external)

Washington, DC – Representatives Dan Goldman (NY-10), Scott Peters (CA-50), and Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-8) introduced the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, which would restrict federal immigration enforcement agents’ use of crowd munitions like tear gas, align immigration enforcement with the heightened DOJ standards on use of force, and require the use of body cameras and strictly limiting the use of masks.

Under President Trump, federal agents have been captured using excessive force against non-violent American citizens(link is external), immigrants(link is external), journalists(link is external), protesters(link is external), priests(link is external), and others. There has been a significant increase in the careless use of harmful equipment like flash bangs(link is external), pepper balls(link is external), and tear gas(link is external). During a recent 60 Minutes interview,(link is external) President Trump was asked about violent examples of immigration enforcement and stated that immigration raids have “not gone far enough.”

""The images we’ve seen out of New York, California, and Chicago are the result of a broken system that allows militarized immigration agents to abuse our neighbors and evade any form of accountability,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “Federal agents should never be storming peaceful communities with tear gas and flash bangs. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act will end these abuses by setting clear limits on force, banning dangerous crowd munitions, and requiring body cameras and identifiable uniforms. No one should fear masked agents without badges on the streets of our cities and neighborhoods. This bill restores transparency, accountability, and the basic principle that law enforcement must protect the people, not attack them.”

Congressman Scott Peters said, “In May, Federal agents stormed into Buona Forchetta, a small, neighborhood restaurant that was filled with families. They threw the owner against the wall, handcuffed all employees, and used flash-bang grenades on concerned bystanders outside the restaurant. Why terrorize law-abiding, hardworking people? That makes no one safer; it makes Americans less safe. Immigration enforcement should not be conducted by masked, unidentified agents using unchecked force and aggressively deploying tear gas, pepper balls, and flash bangs. We must curb excessive force and make it easier to identify officers acting improperly, while ensuring Federal law enforcement can still apprehend those who pose a genuine threat to public safety and nationalsecurity.”

Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, ""ICE, CBP, and DHS agents must be held to the same constitutional standards as every other law enforcement officer. Yet each day of the Trump Administration's ‘Operation Midway Blitz’ brings a new story of excessive force being used in Chicago and its suburbs—from a faith leader shot with a pepperball while praying outside Broadview to a reporter struck while documenting ICE protests to my own constituents being terrorized for performing civilian oversight over DHS's actions. This unchecked aggression against civilians must stop. Our Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act restores transparency and safeguards both the public and law enforcement by ensuring clear standards, mandatory body cameras, and a fundamental respect for basic rights.”

Angelica Salas, Executive Director, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) said, ""For months now, we all have seen how encounters with immigration enforcement mean chaos, violence, and trauma, regardless of immigration status. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act brings humanity and transparency into those moments. It limits the use of militarized force and ensures that agents are accountable to the communities in which they operate. Every family deserves to feel safe. Every life deserves dignity.”

Deborah Weinstein, Executive Director, Coalition on Human Needs said, ""Masked agents endangering our people with unnecessary force is an affront to the principles of American democracy. The Coalition on Human Needs is proud to endorse the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act and stands with Rep. Peters and co-sponsors in requiring accountability and careful restrictions on federal immigration officials' use of force.""

Nick Wilson, Senior Director of Gun Violence Prevention Policy at the Center for American Progress said, “The Trump administration’s reckless and indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions have stoked fear in communities across the country. We welcome the introduction of the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, which seeks to ensure the safety of our communities and officers by implementing common sense standards to improve transparency and accountability in enforcement actions. Law enforcement should protect the public, not trample on people’s rights and put Americans at risk. This bill offers urgently needed guardrails and accountability mechanisms that ensure that federal law enforcement better protects and promotes the rights and safety of communities.”

Sarah Pierce, Director of Social Policy at Third Way, said, ""As ICE under President Trump pursues increasingly extreme actions against both immigrants and U.S. citizens, lawmakers must act to protect their constituents and uphold public safety. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act does exactly that—ensuring federal officers have the tools they need to safeguard the public and themselves, without undermining the security of the communities they are supposed to serve. Its training, oversight, and proportionality requirements are especially critical as ICE expands its workforce through rushed recruitment and abbreviated onboarding. Immigration enforcement should strengthen public safety and the integrity of our immigration system—but never at the expense of the public's security.""

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act:

Prevents enforcement personnel from being equipped with tear gas, pepper balls, and flash bangs, wearing masks, and using non-identifying uniforms.

Aligns immigration enforcement with current DOJ standards on force, allowing it to be used only when “no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist.

Implements additional requirements that personnel exercise force proportionally, use de-escalation techniques, and minimize risk to third persons.

Requires mandatory use of body and vehicle cameras for immigration enforcement.

Reinforces protections against force while engaging lawfully in protected First Amendment activities, such as protesting, reporting, and assembling.

Supports local law enforcement by requiring that they are pre-notified of immigration operations in their jurisdiction and prohibiting Federal immigration enforcement from wearing uniforms with the word “police” to limit public confusion.

Creates training requirements for de-escalation and abiding by constitutional protections.

The president’s lawyer sent the threat to the BBC over the way a documentary edited his Jan. 6, 2021, speech before a mob of his followers stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Trump’s history of suing news media companies — sometimes winning multimillion-dollar settlements — is part of a long-running grievance against the industry he describes as “fake news” that has often focused a critical eye on his actions.

But Trump faces fundamental challenges to getting a case to court, never mind taking it to trial. He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.

“If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box and inside is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about the ‘steal,’” said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the U.S. and U.K.

The BBC documentary

The BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hourlong documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.

BBC Chairman Samir Shah apologized Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action.”

Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.

From to letter to lawsuit

A lawsuit in England is unlikely because the one-year deadline to bring one expired two weeks ago, experts said. If successful in overcoming that barrier, libel awards in the High Court rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000), experts said.

Trump could still bring a defamation claim in several U.S. states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.

Filing a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury.

Before any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC program was not aired in the U.S., and the BBC’s streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a program they could not watch, Stephens said.

“The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan. 6,” he said. “Alleging ‘Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters ... is a tough sell.”

Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.

The demands

Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.

The letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.

It also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”

The letter cites Florida’s defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organizations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.

If the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 p.m. EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.

“The BBC is on notice,” it said.

Other media lawsuits

While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.

Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.

Litigation threat could leverage payout

London lawyer David Allen Green dismissed the litigation letter for failing to spell out any actual harm Trump suffered. But he said Trump’s willingness to use lawsuits as a form of deal-making could leverage a payout because the edit was indefensible.

“Putting aside the theatrics of a bombastic letter with its senseless $1 billion claim, there is a power play here which Trump has done many times before,” Green said on The Law and Policy Blog. “The real mistake of the BBC (and the production company) was opening itself up to such a play of power.”

Stephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.

But he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage from revisiting the Jan. 6 events that would be dredged up at trial.

He said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.

“The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?’” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/771f865/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4860+0+450/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F11%2Fd9%2F0abb62599b4df6f5ad64fa248822%2F2c9dc88366564b39b482e6ddf2cb637f,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:52.800796

Bovino's departure could mean he is set to go to another city, or return to the El Centro Sector, according to a source.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said DHS isn't leaving Chicago.

""We aren't leaving Chicago,"" she posted, citing statistics from ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

A spokesperson for DHS claims crime has fallen since their operations began.

But the ABC7 Chicago data team found that violent crime had been decreasing already over the past 12 months in the city.

A spokesperson for the mayor's office responded to DHS' claim in part, saying ""It is great to hear that the Trump administration acknowledges, as we have been saying for months, that crime is significantly down in Chicago.""

Bovino has had a visible presence in the area throughout federal immigration enforcement.

As a federal judge considered a use of force injunction, which was ultimately granted, Bovino testified to CBP agents' actions.

He defended their use of force.

The Trump administration on Monday filed an emergency request asking the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately pause the preliminary injunction on federal immigration agents' use of force in the Chicago area, while it considers their appeal, saying the order violates the separation of powers.

District Judge Sara Ellis' order prohibits federal agents from ""using riot control weapons"" against journalists, demonstrators and religious practitioners without first issuing warnings unless necessary to stop immediate threats of physical harms to agents or others.

Ellis said the government lied under oath, saying federal agents' conduct in the Chicagoland area shows no signs of stopping.

She also disputed statements made during Bovino's own recorded deposition.

Ellis called Bovino out for at least three instances in which his deposition contradicted the video evidence, including the Little Village incident on Oct. 23 when Bovino publicly said he had thrown a tear gas canister at protesters after being hit by a rock in the head. He later admitted, under oath, he had thrown it before.

It is worth noting that while the 7th Circuit did block Ellis' attempt to have Bovino meet with her daily, they did uphold the temporary restraining order that this order replaces. If it survives on appeal, the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until a trial on this case can be held.

Faith leaders on Tuesday blocked 26th Street, under the arch in Little Village, with a prayer service and makeshift altar.

Volunteers were standing by after reports that federal agents would be back in Little Village Tuesday.

None had been seen as of about 11 a.m.

They're putting pressure on federal agents, they say, and showing organized resistance, together with the faith community.

""Only God has the right to destroy families. Your hate and racism has no place in the United States of America because we are American families, and we want to be treated with respect and dignity,"" said Pastor Julie Contreras, with United Giving Hope.

""They could bring 1,000 agents; we'll bring out 10,000 people to the streets. We don't have guns; we don't have nothing but whistles. And this is how we're going to fight this administration,"" Little Village Community Council President Baltazar Enriquez said.

Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement:

""On the same day Bovino is reportedly leaving Chicago, Trump is yet again threatening to send military troops into an American city against our own citizens. This doesn't mark an end to federal overreach - it marks an expansion. Illinois is remaining clear-eyed that Donald Trump's power-grabbing efforts to undermine American rights and freedoms are continuing with full force. This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety - this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets.

""Chicago IS the nation's best big city for the ninth year in a row because of its growing economy, hardworking people, and neighbors who take care of each other and welcome visitors from every corner of the globe with unmatched warmth and pride. No lies or TruthSocial posts will change that.

""And the only real estate vacancy Trump should be worried about continues to be the one at Trump Tower.""

Perttu v. Richards began when Kyle Brandon Richards and two other incarcerated plaintiffs sued prison manager Thomas Perttu over a year’s worth of “prolific and repetitive sexual abuse.” Their handwritten complaint, filed without counsel, alleged a litany of constitutional violations.
According to Richards, Perttu approached him one morning and said, “Do what the fuck I tell you to do.
Fuck who I tell you to fuck.” When Richards refused, Perttu threatened to kill him.
Before Richards, the Court’s most extended treatment of the party presentation principle occurred in the 2020 decision United States v. Sineneng-Smith.","“In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the principle of party presentation.” The principle dictates that courts decide only the questions presented by the parties before them and pass upon only those arguments the parties make. Last Term, in Perttu v. Richards, the Supreme Court held 5–4 that in cases covered by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), a party has a right to a jury trial on administrative exhaustion when the question of exhaustion is intertwined with the merits of their claim. Hanging over the Court’s split on the PLRA’s meaning was a secondary dispute about the rule of party presentation. Four dissenting Justices accused the majority of violating the rule by resolving the case on grounds the parties had never raised. But Richards simply represents the Court’s longstanding practice of treating party presentation as a rather pliant principle. And on the spectrum of party presentation violations, Richards barely registers — making the decision a minor deviation from a concededly flexible rule.

Perttu v. Richards began when Kyle Brandon Richards and two other incarcerated plaintiffs sued prison manager Thomas Perttu over a year’s worth of “prolific and repetitive sexual abuse.” Their handwritten complaint, filed without counsel, alleged a litany of constitutional violations. According to Richards, Perttu approached him one morning and said, “Do what the fuck I tell you to do. Fuck who I tell you to fuck.” When Richards refused, Perttu threatened to kill him. On a separate occasion, Perttu warned that he could keep Richards in prison “forever,” so “[j]ust do what I ask you to.” Another time, Perttu demanded: “Come on bitch boy, take another piss for me. Piss for me boy, and Ill [sic] let you go home.”

Richards sought relief through the prison complaint system, submitting at least a dozen grievances under the Prison Rape Elimination Act. While some were processed, any grievances describing sexual abuse “never got processed and were destroyed.” Perttu reportedly said he was “not going to let [Richards] file any sexual assault grievances.” On several occasions, Perttu tore up the grievance forms and promised to kill the plaintiffs if they submitted any more.

So Richards and his co-plaintiffs brought a Section 1983 suit in federal court. In addition to describing Perttu’s interference with the prison grievance procedure, they claimed that the facility had retaliated against them by placing them in solitary confinement, thereby violating the First Amendment. Perttu moved for summary judgment on the basis “that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust available grievance procedures as required by the PLRA.” The court sided with Perttu and dismissed the case for failure to exhaust. Richards, still acting pro se and now the sole plaintiff, appealed.

The Sixth Circuit appointed counsel and reversed. The panel recognized that the PLRA required incarcerated plaintiffs to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing suit. But remedies had to be available. If “prison administrators [had] thwart[ed] inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation,” the exhaustion requirement didn’t apply. Whether exhaustion precluded Richards’s suit was therefore bound up with the merits of his First Amendment retaliation claim, since both turned on the same factual question: Had Perttu blocked Richards from filing his grievances? The judge had erred by deciding that question himself. “[T]he Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial when the resolution of the exhaustion issue under the PLRA would also resolve a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the merits of the plaintiff’s substantive case.”

The Supreme Court affirmed on a 5–4 vote, but not because the Seventh Amendment demanded it. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts ducked the constitutional question and opted for “a construction of the statute . . . by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided.” As a statutory matter, the Court held that “parties have a right to a jury trial on PLRA exhaustion when that issue is intertwined with the merits of a claim that falls under the Seventh Amendment.” A 2007 decision by the Chief Justice, Jones v. Bock, had taken up whether PLRA exhaustion was an affirmative defense or a mandatory element of a plaintiff’s complaint. Jones had landed on the former because the PLRA’s “silen[ce] on the issue” represented “strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed,” and exhaustion was usually an affirmative defense. That logic applied equally here. Because the PLRA was “‘silent on the issue’ whether judges or juries should resolve factual disputes related to exhaustion,” it incorporated the settled practice that when factual disputes are intertwined with the merits of a claim — thus triggering the Seventh Amendment — the whole bundle goes to the jury, including issues (like exhaustion) a judge would ordinarily decide on her own.

Justice Barrett dissented, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh. Justice Barrett first recognized the difficulty of identifying a founding-era analogue to the defense of exhaustion given that the defense arose “long after the founding.” Happily, Richards did not require answering that particular question, since the case concerned the unique circumstance of a factual dispute about exhaustion intertwined with the merits of the claim. Unhappily, in avoiding the Seventh Amendment question, the majority relied upon a “statutory theory” “not present[ed]” by either party in the Supreme Court or any court below. Resolving the case on that basis violated “party-presentation principles,” under which the Court generally “refuse[d] to consider arguments that the parties failed to make before” it and that “the court of appeals did not analyze first.” To make matters worse, the statutory argument was incorrect. Whereas the majority guaranteed Richards a jury trial on account of the PLRA’s silence, Justice Barrett “understood silence to mean . . . that Congress did not affirmatively confer such a right.”

The disagreement between the Justices represents more than a difference in statutory interpretation. By accusing the majority of reaching out to decide a case on grounds that no party advocated, the dissent highlighted a vexed question of judicial practice: party presentation principles in the United States Supreme Court. Time and again, the Court has emphasized that litigants, through their counsel, “know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and argument entitling them to relief.” As a result, the Court “rel[ies] on the parties to frame the issues for decision” while acting as a “neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.” Fair enough. But in practice, the Supreme Court has not exactly followed its own instruction — suggesting that party presentation is more of a guiding principle than an absolute rule.

Before Richards, the Court’s most extended treatment of the party presentation principle occurred in the 2020 decision United States v. Sineneng-Smith. There, the Court reversed a Ninth Circuit judgment on account of the circuit court’s “takeover of the appeal.” After briefing and oral argument, the Ninth Circuit had ordered further briefing by court-appointed amici on three additional questions the court wanted answers to. It then reversed the district court’s judgment on the basis of amici’s responses — not arguments made by the defendant herself. The Court found this insupportable. While “a court is not hidebound by the precise arguments of counsel, [] the Ninth Circuit’s radical transformation of this case [went] well beyond the pale.”

All that makes Sineneng-Smith seem like a straightforward confirmation of the fact that party presentation limits courts’ ability to look beyond the parties’ arguments. Yet Sineneng-Smith itself was a bit of a dodge. The Court had granted certiorari on the question of whether a federal statute criminalizing the encouragement of unlawful immigration for profit violated the First Amendment. Its resolution of that question was “hotly anticipated.” But the Court never reached the First Amendment issue. Instead, it disposed of the case in a relatively sparse opinion by resting entirely on the party presentation principle.

Do as I say, not as I do. As Judge Eric D. Miller observed, by deciding the case this way, the Court itself bent the rule. In its opening brief urging reversal, all the United States had said on the issue of party presentation boiled down to a short paragraph at the tail end of the document, noting that “[i]n reaching out to address this issue, the Ninth Circuit . . . deviated from . . . the normal course of party-driven litigation.” The government “did not elaborate on that objection, let alone advance it as a basis for reversal.” Both parties devoted their briefing to the First Amendment issue. While chastising the court of appeals for breaking from the principle of party presentation, the Court took a detour of its own.

Small wonder Sineneng-Smith described “[t]he party presentation principle [as] supple, not ironclad.” And in a footnote, the Court self-consciously appended an addendum of cases from 2015–20 where it had “called for supplemental briefing or appointed amicus curiae,” including “to present argument in support of the judgment below when a prevailing party has declined to defend the lower court’s decision or an aspect of it.” None of the cases, the Court insisted, bore “any resemblance to the redirection ordered by the Ninth Circuit panel in” Sineneng-Smith. But why not? “While the Court seems completely confident of its authority to appoint such amici, it provides no explanation for the practice.” Maybe the difference lies between appointing amici to defend the lower court’s decision versus arguments never articulated by the parties themselves. Perhaps the former approach takes the issues as they arrive for review, while the latter veers too far into naked judicial activism. Less charitably, “perhaps the Court doth protest too much; the length of the list is enough to make one suspect that the Court has been less than scrupulous in its adherence to the principles it articulated.”

Turn the clock back a little further, and the list will only grow. Professor Amanda Frost has noted that “some of the Supreme Court’s landmark cases were decided on grounds that were never raised by the parties.” This includes Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, where “neither the petitioner nor the respondent took issue with Swift v. Tyson’s holding that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction could create federal common law”; Washington v. Davis, where the defendants agreed that plaintiffs could prove an equal protection violation without pleading discriminatory animus — only for the Court to disregard the concession and hold that plaintiffs could not; and Dickerson v. United States, where “both the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court questioned whether a federal statute . . . [could] displac[e] the Court’s ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, even though neither party relied on that statute.”

Recall the possibility that appointing amici to support an undefended judgment might be permissible, but not to brief arguments the parties never raised below. Dickerson complicates that distinction. The federal statute in question, 18 U.S.C. § 3501, sought to overturn Miranda’s reticulated warnings framework by allowing confessions to be admitted whenever voluntarily given. “Because no party to the underlying litigation argued in favor of § 3501’s constitutionality in this Court,” the Court explained in a footnote, it had “invited Professor Paul Cassell to assist [its] deliberations by arguing in support of the judgment below.” Yet the statute had gone undefended even in the court of appeals. The Fourth Circuit explicitly recognized that “the applicability of § 3501 was not briefed by the Government,” and that the Department of Justice had “actually prohibit[ed] the U.S. Attorney’s Office from briefing the issue.” It was the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest group, which had presented the § 3501 argument in an amicus brief. A panel majority saw fit to press on with the § 3501 analysis, over a dissent which strenuously disagreed. In the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion made no mention of the problem of potentially violating party presentation. All the airtime party presentation got was the single-sentence footnote.

By playing fast and loose with the party presentation principle, Dickerson resembles another Fourth Amendment decision rendered almost forty years earlier — one that hadn’t been litigated as a Fourth Amendment case at all. In Mapp v. Ohio, a woman convicted for possessing obscene materials challenged her conviction under the First Amendment. A majority of Justices voted to reverse her conviction, and in so doing issued a watershed decision incorporating the exclusionary rule against the states. No party had urged that outcome. And the Court had to overturn one of its prior decisions, Wolf v. Colorado, to get there. As the Court recognized in a footnote (by now a familiar move), Mapp herself “did not insist that Wolf be overruled”; indeed, Mapp’s counsel “expressly disavowed” that request in oral argument. But a brief by “amicus curiae [the ACLU] . . . did urge the Court to overrule Wolf” — in a single three-sentence paragraph. That was sufficient. Dissenting, Justice Harlan chastised the majority for “simply ‘reach[ing] out’ to overrule Wolf” when Mapp’s brief had “not even cite[d] the case.” More than six decades later, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Barrett’s dueling opinions reprised in Richards this very old debate.

Given Dickerson, Mapp, and Sineneng-Smith, the majority’s move in Richards is not so radical. Yet even on its own terms, the Court’s statutory analysis was not a major departure from the arguments the parties had made. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged Justice Barrett’s critique but contended that “the statutory question ha[d] been fully briefed by amici and involves the same precedents relied on by the parties.” The Court thus appeared to concede that the dispositive statutory argument had been made by amici (a group of law professors), not the parties themselves. It didn’t need to. Richards’s merits brief had mentioned the “usual practice” no fewer than seven times. For instance, he had argued that under Beacon Theaters, Inc. v. Westover, “juries decide all factual questions necessary to resolve the merits of a legal claim, even when some of those questions may overlap with issues a judge could otherwise decide,” “and there [was] no indication that Congress intended to depart from” this “usual practice” — meaning that the PLRA incorporated it.

It is true that Richards did not explicitly urge the Court to avoid the constitutional holding and rely on a statutory rationale. But in this context, the distance between a statutory and constitutional ruling is smaller than it first appears. The “usual practice” at the time of the PLRA’s enactment had the Seventh Amendment baked in: Courts tried legal claims before equitable ones, or declined to resolve jurisdictional issues that would effectively decide the merits, because that was what the Seventh Amendment demanded. In the end, the distinction that makes a difference might boil down to the Court’s decision to “express no view [] on whether Congress could have required otherwise in the PLRA without violating a party’s Seventh Amendment right.” Said another way, because Richards is not a constitutional decision, Congress may overrule it.

Why does the Court stray from the supposedly fundamental principle of party presentation more often than the Justices seem willing to admit?

At a high level, the debate over party presentation echoes the longstanding competition between two models of judicial review: (1) law declaration — which would favor a loose party presentation principle — and (2) dispute resolution — which would command a strict rule. Advocates for the former model warn that parties cannot be allowed to “completely control the judiciary’s statements of law . . . lest they undermine the federal courts’ role to independently ascertain the meaning of legal texts for the benefit of all.” Critics retort that since courts exist for the very purpose of dispute resolution, the parties alone should decide “both the legal and factual claims relevant to their dispute.” Yet in the end, most agree that the American judicial system contains features of both approaches; its “choice among these models is ‘all of the above.’”

Consistent with this blended approach, the Court’s departures from party presentation have varied in degree. Resolving a case on grounds not wildly dissimilar from the parties’ positions (as in Richards) tilts only weakly toward a law declaration model. By contrast, basing an opinion on an argument expressly disavowed by petitioner’s counsel (as in Mapp) reflects a far more muscular exercise of judicial agenda control. The practice of appointing amici to argue an undefended judgment sits between the two poles. Doing so echoes law declaration in that the Court refuses to let one side’s concession constrain its ability to say what the law is. But appointing amici might also be understood as guardrail on freewheeling law declaration by forcing “adversary presentation as an aid to the accurate determination of factual and legal issues.” Finally, the Court’s habit of formulating entirely new questions presented indicates a certain fondness for law declaration. But at least the parties will themselves brief the additional question; at least they have notice of a potential basis for the Court’s eventual disposition.

Why should the Court be so free to deviate from party presentation when, as Sineneng-Smith indicates, lower federal courts are not? Nearly thirty years ago, Judge Laurence Silberman posited that the Justices did not wish “to restrict their own ability to reach out to issues not presented in cases brought to the Court, nor . . . justify that practice by openly acknowledging the Supreme Court as not subject to normal judicial constraints.” He did not think this was a good thing. But as a structural matter, the Supreme Court may face unique pressures to get the law “right” regardless of what the parties do. Unlike lower court decisions, which are precedential only within their respective jurisdictions, the Supreme Court’s holdings bind the nation, making it especially important for the Court to reach the right result. Moreover, a circuit court panel can choose to issue an unpublished opinion tying only the parties to the consequences of their litigation choices. The Supreme Court cannot.

Moreover, the Court’s turn towards law declaration (and attendant departures from party presentation) may reflect its increasingly outsized role in resolving national disputes. Perttu is a win for a relatively slim class of incarcerated litigants, but party presentation has taken a beating in more high-profile cases too. For instance, the Court recently ordered supplemental briefing on an issue raised by a law professor as amici in litigation challenging the National Guard’s deployment in Illinois — an issue to which the United States had “devote[d] only a cursory footnote,” and which the respondents had not briefed at all.

The upshot is that the Court has not, and likely never will, box itself in by enshrining a strong form of party presentation. Viewed in perspective, Richards is hardly a departure from a principle that has never been all that strict. By resolving the case on grounds advanced chiefly (though not exclusively) by amici, the Richards Court followed the “usual practice” in more ways than one.",https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HLR-Logo.png,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:58.148837

(Neither Northrop Grumman nor Raytheon, which rebranded as RTX in 2023, immediately responded to requests for comment.)

Both weapon-makers have been seen as profiting off Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman’s stock prices spiked after October 7, 2023, as Israel ramped up its attacks.

Since Israel’s assault on Gaza, HRC’s sponsorships had increasingly come in for criticisms from sympathetic celebrities speaking out on Gaza.

At a February 2024 protest outside HRC’s annual gala, protesters condemned the groups’ sponsorship by Northrop Grumman.

“[HRC’s] initiatives that are meant to benefit us are being funded by a weapons manufacturer. Not cute, not queer,” actor Indya Moore told the crowd of protesters. “Their bullets, their bombs, and their missiles are massacring Palestinians who are also queer and trans and deserving of a human rights campaign.”

While accepting HRC’s own “Visibility Award” for LGBTQ+ representation in March 2025, actor Hannah Einbinder condemned the silencing of the Palestinian struggle and the ongoing genocidal war and called out oil companies like Shell and BP for their role in the climate crisis. Investigations have shown that BP’s oil supply is deeply involved in Israel’s war machine.

Einbinder has repeatedly called attention to Palestine and boycotting Israel’s warfare. In September 2025, she made headlines for calling for a free Palestine during her Emmy acceptance speech, and the same month she joined a boycott organized by Film Workers for Palestine against Israeli film institutions implicated in the Gaza war and “apartheid against the Palestinian people.”

A statement provided to The Intercept from HRC said Raytheon and Northrop Grumman no longer sponsored the group, but didn’t directly address when or how the relationships ended. The statement cast the changes as of a piece with the group’s long-held stances against extremism.

“While our focus is on LGBTQ+ equality in the United States, we have spoken out about the crisis, the rising cost of extremism in the United States and around the globe and how Islamophobia, anti-semitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred are globally linked,” a spokesperson for HRC said. “We have also championed the right to protest here in the United States, as it and other pro-democratic principles are being undermined and threatened by this administration.”

Adalah and Gender Liberation Movement said that pro-Palestine groups including No Pride in Genocide and Writers Against the War on Gaza had pushed for this move since at least October 7, 2023.

Highlighting Northrop Grumman in particular for its production of weapons used in Israel’s genocide against Gaza, the Adalah and the Gender Liberation Movement statement says, “These are tools of state-sanctioned destruction and death, not of human rights or equality, and they do not distinguish between queer and straight lives.”

The two groups also noted in their statement that HRC did not commit to permanently rejecting cash from any weapons manufacturers, nor did it adhere to organizers’ demands to call for an arms embargo on Israel.

The statement says, “Our work is not finished, and we remain committed to the struggle.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2155939161-e1762875035991.jpg?fit=4992%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:40.144517

I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music.
Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City.
The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans.
I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.","This year marks the 10th anniversary of splitting my life between the two countries I call home. My brother Jose was deported from the United States in October 2015 at age 29. He had been here since he was 2 years old. He was returned to Mexico, a country he didn’t even know.

My parents arrived in the U.S. with my two older brothers in 1989, following the rest of my mom’s family’s migration, missing their window for the Amnesty program. I was the only citizen in my family, born in Whittier and raised across Southern California. I grew up well aware of our situation, the privilege my social security number gave me, knowing that at any given moment or traffic stop, my family could be taken from me.

In 2015, I was in my last year of college, studying flashcards for my music industry midterm, when my mom called to tell me that my worst nightmare had come true.

In the 10 years since, I’ve crossed the San Ysidro Port of Entry more times than I can count, spending hours in line with a heaviness in my chest. When I’d visit my brother in Tijuana, he would ride with me until I was about to cross over. He’d hop out, we’d say our goodbyes, and I’d cry the rest of the way home. As a child, I felt the frustration of injustice for my family. But I silenced those feelings, afraid of outing their immigration status. As an adult, with their blessing, that frustration has turned into an outcry for them and the millions of families like ours.

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, 271,484 people were removed from the United States in fiscal year 2024—each deportation fracturing families like mine. Many of our parents came to the U.S. sold on the “American Dream” only to find themselves living a nightmare. They sacrificed their dreams and their careers and worked exploitative, under-the-table jobs around the clock, with no path to citizenship in sight. Now I find myself, like other first generation kids sharing similar stories online, pursuing a reverse migration toward the “Mexican Dream.”

For a long time, I fantasized about what life would be like for my family had we stayed in Mexico, or at least had the opportunity to visit over the summer and holidays like I saw my friends and their families do, their vans filled to the brim with gifts and necessities for loved ones on the other side of the border. I made a promise to myself that one day I would give myself the opportunity to at least live a chapter of my life there. Now I’m fulfilling that promise.

I knew it wouldn’t be easy to take the leap to move back to the motherland. The final push came when, in the span of two months, my grandmother passed away, I ended an abusive relationship, and Disney shelved the documentary to which I had devoted my life. Grief swallowed me whole, and all I wanted was to heal and be held by my family and the land that gave them life.

Retracing the steps of my ancestors, I began in Guadalajara with my maternal side. I met around 25 family members for the first time, but the matriarchal connection with my tías and primas was so deep, it felt like the home I always dreamed of, allowing me to truly mourn my abuela through their stories.

I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music. I’ve been coming to the city since 2018. Over time I began to understand my family’s roots here, and I knew that my next music projects had to be created here–rooted in the connection to my ancestors.

Mexico is currently home to over one million Americans—the largest population of U.S. citizens living outside the United States—with an estimated 700,000 in Mexico City alone. Two and a half years later, I’m still here.

My dad’s side of the family has been in this city for nearly 100 years, coming down from Alamos, Sonora, in the 1930s for my bisabuelo’s government job. They had always been a mystery to me, as my abuelo was a pilot and died in a plane crash when my dad was a teenager. Through interviews with my two last living tía abuelas, I discovered family lore I never knew—stories of quinceañeras at Castillo de Chapultepec and possible connections to legendary Mexican cinema stars. It was a life I never knew existed as a low-income, first-generation kid of undocumented immigrants, stuck in a country that my family couldn't leave.

So what does it mean for me to be here in Mexico today as a dual citizen?

Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City. Demonstrators are expressing their rightful anger at the exploitation of the cost of living, which has been inflated by the surge of foreigners who have come here since the pandemic-induced digital nomad movement.

Meanwhile, back in California, the number of people reporting to work in the private sector decreased by 3.1% after immigration raids began—a downturn only recently matched by COVID-19 lockdowns, showing how enforcement tears apart both economies and communities. As a Mexican American, I’ve been caught in the crossfires of this ongoing discourse.

The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans. It’s about the question: Where can we call home? A home that feels safe and dignified and where you actually belong.

As an artist and freelancer, I’ve worked contracts in pesos and dollars. My parents made the sacrifices they did for me to have that opportunity. It’s a privilege I do not take for granted. But what does that mean for people like my brother who have been deported, lived their whole lives in the states, and jobs they can get are call centers that pay in dollars? Or folks who live in Tijuana and have to pay rent in dollars? Where do we fit in this equation?

All I wanted was for folks in the U.S. who dehumanized families like mine, writing us off as “illegal”, to see our humanity. I didn’t realize I would also have to fight for our existence with our folks back in Mexico too.

The work of Chicana scholar and foremother, Gloria Anzaldua, reminds us we are not alone in existing in this liminal space — Nepantla, the Nahuatl word for “in-between.” This feels like a true reflection of my identity, and the chapter of my life from which I’m emerging. I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.

I am grateful for everything this land has given me, and I will live here for as long as I am meant to. Wherever life takes me, if and when I have to go back to the U.S. to pursue other dreams, my goal is to create everything I can from my time here and bring it back as an offering to our people over there.

I know I will still spend the rest of my life in between both countries. And if I am to have a family to call my own one day, I’ll spend the summers I never got to have as a kid with them and my family in Mexico. I will honor my parents’ sacrifices in every way I can, and continue to pass on the love for our roots to the next generation. As our paisanos are persecuted up north, I hope to see growing solidarity and welcome among our own people south of the border as well.

What we know:

On Monday, a Chicago Tribune report suggested Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and his team would soon be reassigned. However, a DHS spokesperson on Tuesday pushed back, saying, ""We aren't leaving Chicago.""

The agency said since Operation Midway Blitz began, homicides in Chicago have dropped 16 percent, shootings are down 35 percent, robberies down 41 percent, carjackings down 48 percent, and transit crime is down 20 percent.

The denial came as Bovino prepared to visit the Little Village neighborhood on Tuesday, where community groups are planning a 9:15 a.m. demonstration at the neighborhood’s iconic arch. Gov. JB Pritzker is scheduled to appear later that morning at an American Legion event nearby.

The backstory:

Tensions between city and federal officials flared again this week after a photo circulated online showing Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s Cloud Gate sculpture, better known as ""The Bean.""

According to Block Club Chicago, some agents shouted ""Little Village"" instead of ""cheese"" while taking the picture, an apparent reference to the Southwest Side neighborhood where federal agents clashed with protesters over the weekend.

Gov. JB Pritzker sharply criticized the image, calling it ""disgusting"" and accusing federal officers of ""producing reality TV moments"" instead of keeping residents safe.

""As children are tear gassed and U.S. citizens detained, they are posing for photo ops,"" Pritzker said.

Bovino fired back on X, accusing Pritzker of lying and defending the operation as an effort to root out gangs like the Latin Kings ""that you've allowed to fester with no action for years."" He ended his post with, ""Feel free to join us in Little Village.""

‘CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST’

Big picture view:

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump late Monday night weighed in on Truth Social, calling Chicago’s crime out of control and urging troops be called in ""BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!""

He also called the Magnificent Mile the ""Miracle Mile"" and said the ""28% vacancy factor"" along the iconic strip is due to ""murder and crime.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/bovino-pritzker-trump-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-11 12:03:25.900411

It was unclear where the team would be headed after it leaves Chicago, the sources said. Bovino said in a sworn deposition that he oversees more than 200 Border Patrol agents who were assigned to the Chicago area in early September. Since then, DHS officials have reported more than 3,000 arrests as part of the federal presence, dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operation has involved multiple federal agencies, some of which are slated to remain in Chicago, according to sources. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has been in Chicago for decades, will not be leaving the city.

The date of Bovino’s departure, along with the reassignment of Border Patrol agents, is yet to be determined, the sources told NewsNation.

DHS officials did not confirm the departure and instead said the ongoing mission in Chicago will continue. In a post on X, Tricia McLaughlin wrote, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”

In the post, McLaughlin wrote that since the start of Operation Midway Blitz, homicides in Chicago have dropped by 16%, shootings have decreased by 35%, robberies have declined by 41%, carjackings have dropped by 48% and transit crimes have declined 20%.

Bovino, who has remained the face of the federal presence in Chicago, told NewsNation last week that Border Patrol agents have “received a lot of thanks” from local residents and immigrants who are in the United States legally.

“They’re concerned that individuals who come to the United States (illegally) commit crimes, and I think people are beginning to realize that illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” Bovino said.

Bovino has remained a main target of elected officials in Illinois, namely Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. On Monday, Pritzker responded to a photo of Bovino and Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s iconic Cloud Gate sculpture, where Block Club Chicago reported an agent yelled, “Everyone say, Little Village,” before a photo was taken.

In a social media post, Pritzker said, “Making fun of our neighborhoods and communities is disgusting.” A spokesperson for Pritzker’s office did not respond to a request for comment from NewsNation on Monday after Bovino invited Pritzker to join him in the city’s Little Village neighborhood Tuesday.

Little Village has remained a flashpoint of clashes between federal agents and residents throughout the federal operation. Bovino was captured on video throwing a canister of tear gas into a crowd of protesters, which drew the ire of U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who had previously issued a temporary restraining order, limiting the use of force by federal agents.

Last week, Ellis extended the order with an extensive injunction and ruled Bovino had lied under oath about being hit in the head with a rock before throwing the tear gas. On Monday, attorneys for the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to have a stay issued in response to Ellis’ order.

“Greg Bovino and his masked agents are not here to make Chicago safer,” the governor wrote. “… They are posing for photo ops and producing reality TV moments.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/68e3fdf2a353c0.42947885.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-11 11:02:54.555129
