That means up to millions of people will have to wait in detention for potentially prolonged periods as they face deportation proceedings. The Board of Immigration Appeals published the decision, which applies nationwide, on Friday, Sept. 5.

Gabriel Harrison, lawyer for the detained resident, said the ruling was a major departure from decades of precedent.

Previously, he said, those who had entered without authorization but “established a life” for themselves in the U.S. could get released on bond based on whether a judge thought they were “a flight risk or a danger to society.”

Aaron Korthuis, attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, agreed. Until recently, the law was long interpreted to allow people who entered the U.S. without inspection and weren’t initially apprehended to have bond hearings, he said.

Immigration judges must comply with the appellate board’s ruling unless it is overturned by the Attorney General or a federal court.

In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote the decision was a “[b]ig win for our [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorneys securing our ability to detain illegal aliens until they are deported.”

She added, “The One Big Beautiful Bill includes significant funding for new ICE lawyers.”

The Trump Administration announced in July that immigrants who entered the country without authorization would have to wait in detention for their deportation case to be resolved. The recent immigration board decision upheld the administration’s stance.

Korthuis noted that because so few people are currently entering the U.S., those impacted by the policy are often those who have lived in the country for years — even decades.

“They have U.S. citizen children, maybe even U.S. citizen spouses or family members, and have worked for years or decades in our agriculture or construction industries,” he said, “and simply are people whose home and identity is here in the United States.”

He added that judges in Tacoma Immigration Court have interpreted the law this way for the past couple years, “out of sync with literally the rest of the country.”

Korthuis and other attorneys at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project have two pending class action lawsuits filed earlier this year, challenging the policy on behalf of those detained in Washington and on behalf of those who entered the U.S. without inspection nationwide.

In the nationwide lawsuit, the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project is suing with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. Suing the government in federal court is “the only means for relief for people at this point,” Korthuis said.

The Tacoma Immigration Court’s website directs media inquiries to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an agency of the federal Department of Justice.

In an email, Executive Office for Immigration Review spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly wrote, “Immigration judges adjudicate all matters before them on a case-by-case basis.”

“Immigration judges consider all evidence and arguments presented by both parties and decide each case in a manner that is timely, impartial, and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and case precedent, and consistent with due process,” she continued.

She declined to comment on the recent immigration board decision, writing that “the decision speaks for itself.”

Harrison said the immigration board’s ruling “will affect every single person that comes to us now” who entered without inspection and is detained. He expects many people to give up on their case instead of appealing if they lose initially, rather than wait in detention for potentially years.

Korthuis thinks so, too. Detention, he said, is likely the “single most effective means to force people to leave the country.”",https://www.cascadiadaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-Lelo-Vanderhoef-Tacoma-20250513-SO.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 04:56:23.668135

In an interview on Friday evening, the lawyers said the case bore similarities to that of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year and who continues to fight a labyrinthine legal battle as the administration tries to deport him to various African countries. As in his case, the suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Washington, raised the question of whether the administration had defied judges’ orders protecting the migrants.

The Trump administration has brokered deals with several African nations, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini and — most recently — Ghana, to accept deported migrants, many of whom have no connection to those countries. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out his promised mass deportation operation, have moved swiftly on these so-called third-country deportations.

Lawyers with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, representing the five migrants, accused the administration of using its agreement with Ghana to ignore the legal protections that prevent deportation to their home countries because they fear torture or persecution. In essence, they argued, the administration has enabled an “end run” around those prohibitions, by first removing them to Ghana, and then claiming it is powerless to stop Ghana from sending them to their home countries.

“Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,” the lawyers said in their filing. “Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, defendants’ objective is clear: Deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.”

One type of legal protection for those migrants includes a status called “withholding of removal,” the same protection that should have prevented Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador.

ET: This article has been updated to note the case was decided by an appeals court, not the Supreme Court.","An appeals court ruled on Friday that the Trump administration can begin deporting around 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Newsweek reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) via email on Friday evening for comment.

Why It Matters

DHS ordered half a million migrants to self-deport, issuing termination notices to nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had entered the country under ""humanitarian parole"" programs that started under the administration of former President Joe Biden.

This marked the first mass revocation of humanitarian parole, according to the Associated Press (AP).

The initial effort affected over 500,000 migrants across the nation, and DHS advised that those who did not leave voluntarily ""may be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to detention and removal, without an opportunity to make personal arrangements and return to your country in an orderly manner.""

The Supreme Court in May issued a single-paragraph decision, unsigned, that granted a stay against an initial order issued by a judge that halted the deportations pending a decision in appeals court. Democrat-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

What To Know

Today's two-page decision lifts a district judge's ruling that blocked the Trump administration from canceling the ""humanitarian parole"" programs.

The administration sought to continue its deportations while the legal question played out in courts, which the initial order blocked.

Following the Supreme Court's decision, the administration urged the appeals court to make a similar decision, writing in a brief that ""the Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter.""

The three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston delivered a final decision Friday evening. Immigrants who entered the U.S. under the program will now lose their permits to work and are at immediate risk of deportation.

""We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,"" the judges wrote.

""But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,"" they added.

Lawyers for plaintiffs maintain the district court that issued the initial block ""applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion.""

We start today's other headlines outside Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot and killed a suspect who had tried to avoid arrest by driving his car into officers. Authorities say the incident took place in the Franklin Park suburb about 18 miles west of Chicago. One officer was hit by the vehicle, was taken to a hospital, and is now in stable condition.

DHS says the suspect was in the country illegally and had a history of reckless driving. The shooting comes amid a broader federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

Meantime, President Trump says he's sending National Guard troops to Memphis to address crime there. On FOX News this morning, the president said the state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor are, in his words, happy about the plan.

Later, at a news conference, Mayor Paul Young confirmed his commitment, but made clear he doesn't necessarily agree with the approach.

Paul Young, Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee: I did not ask for the National Guard, and I don't think it's the way to drive down crime. However, that decision has been made. My commitment is to make sure that we work strategically to ensure that this happens in a way that truly benefits and strengthens our community.

Geoff Bennett:

Other Tennessee officials are more critical. The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, criticized the move in a social media post, saying: ""No one here is happy, not happy at all with the occupation, armored vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and military personnel in fatigues.""

This week, Memphis police reported a decrease across all major crime categories in the first eight months of 2025 compared to previous years.

Missouri's Senate passed a redistricting plan today that could help Republicans pick up an additional seat in Congress. Once signed by the governor, it would make Missouri the third state to change its maps ahead of next year's midterm elections. Texas has already passed a measure that would help Republicans pick up five seats. California countered with a similar plan to aid Democrats, though it still needs voter approval.

Opponents of Missouri's measure are trying to push back, though. They have launched a petition effort to try to force a statewide referendum on the new map.

The Environmental Protection Agency moved today to stop the collection of emissions data from some 8,000 U.S. facilities. The proposal, which still needs to be finalized, would end a program that requires coal-burning power plants and other industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2010, the government has used this data to assess the environmental impact of those sites.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the requirement is — quote — ""nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality."" Critics say the proposal could hurt efforts to fight climate change.

Many of the nation's universities are on heightened alert heading into the weekend after a series of fake threats led schools to cancel classes and even send students home. At least six historically Black colleges and universities have been the targets of such threats in recent days. A similar incident happened at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

At the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, a midshipman and law enforcement officer were injured after a false report of an active shooter caused confusion on that campus. Both are now in stable condition. The threats come amid heightened tensions following the murder of Charlie Kirk on a campus in Utah, though the FBI says there have been no credible threats so far.

The U.N. General Assembly says it's endorsing what it calls tangible and irreversible steps for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Today's declaration was boycotted by the U.S. and Israel. It comes ahead of a gathering by world leaders at the U.N. later this month, where Britain, France, and others are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.

Ahead of that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is heading to Israel next week to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israeli security. Meantime, in Gaza today, health officials say Israeli strikes killed at least 40 people, most of them in Gaza City. Residents say they are caught in the crossfire.

Fawzi Medna, Resident of Targeted Neighborhood (through interpreter): People are in the streets. Where are they supposed to go? Please look. Where are the people going? We are exhausted. We are unarmed. We belong to no one. We are civilians.

Geoff Bennett:

The latest Gaza strikes come amid ongoing anger among Arab nations over Israel's strike this week targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Qatar's prime minister was in Washington today meeting with top U.S. officials to discuss the strike. He's also set to meet with President Trump in New York. Qatar will host an emergency summit of Arab leaders on Sunday.

Nepal has a new interim prime minister following that country's worst upheaval in years. Former Supreme Court Justice Sushila Karki took her oath on live television today. She's the first woman ever to head that nation's government. Karki takes the helm after violent protests over a short-lived social media ban forced her predecessor to resign. Protesters torched government buildings and clashed with police. Officials now say at least 51 people were killed.

Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, filed against the Trump administration in the latter case regarding foreign aid.","The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing two Trump administration emergency requests: one involving the removal of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and another regardinga freeze on federal foreign aid.

Why It Matters

The Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has ruled in favor of the Trump administration on many key issues including immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. Over a dozen emergency requests from the Trump administration have been granted by the Court this term.

The cases examine executive power, including the lawfulness and precedent governing removal of FTC commissioners, and whether a president may withhold congressionally appropriated foreign aid.

What To Know

In Trump v. Slaughter, the administration is requesting the Court to halt a ruling that reinstatesan FTC commissioner that Trump fired, Rebecca Slaughter.

Trump first sought to oust the Democratic commissioner in the spring. She sued, and lower courts ordered her reinstated, citing laws that restrict removal of FTC commissioners to cases involving misconduct or neglect of duty.

The Justice Department has maintained that the FTC and similar agencies fall squarely under presidential authority, allowing Trump to remove commissioners without cause. Slaughter, however, argues that her position is protected by law and by decades of legal precedent.

Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused lower rulings and directed Slaughter's attorneys to file their response to the government's arguments by September 15.

The second case, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the administration is seeking to block billions of dollars in foreign aid. Since inauguration day, Trump has worked to pause foreign aid, issuing an executive order on the matter, which led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to freeze payments from the State Department and then now-dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

A judge ordered the administration to spend $4 billion in foreign aid by September 30; however, Trump's legal team argues the president has the right to propose a rescission, a cancellation of previously approved funds.

Roberts ordered a response to the application be filed by 4 p.m. on Friday.

Amicus briefs have been filed for both cases. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, filed against the Trump administration in the latter case regarding foreign aid.

What People Are Saying

Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, in an amicus brief filed in Trump v. Slaughter: ""Because the President's limited authority to temporarily withhold funds proposed for rescission under the ICA does not permit the President to withhold those funds through their date of expiration without action from Congress, the district court's injunction imposes no greater burden on the government than already exists under that law. The stakes for Congress and the public, however, are high. The fiscal year ends on September 30, less than three weeks from today.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the 6th Circuit Judicial Conference last week: ""We all fall short at times, but I think redoubling our efforts on tone, especially when the tone around us is in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud, it's probably important.""

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democratic wrote on X in March: ""Donald Trump just illegally fired two independent commissioners at the FTC who fight big corporations that abuse consumers and workers. Why? Trump's billionaire donors expect a return on their investment. He works for them, not you. The courts must reinstate the commissioners.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said earlier in September regarding a Court case pertaining to mass federal firings, per Reuters: ""Yet another win for the Trump administration affirming the president's lawful actions and dismissing the unlawful ruling by a lower court judge.""

BOSTON — The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration today in Svitlana Doe v. Noem, ruling that the administration’s termination of humanitarian parole was lawful. This ruling impacts the lawful parole status and work authorization for half a million “CHNV” humanitarian parole recipients from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This is the first ruling in Svitlana since the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration’s extraordinary request on May 30 to reverse the district court’s order blocking the termination — even before the First Circuit heard the case on appeal in July.

This decision is specifically about CHNV humanitarian parole, but it has significant implications for the other humanitarian parole programs at issue in the Svitlana litigation, such as Uniting for Ukraine and Operation Allies Welcome — jeopardizing the lawful status of hundreds of thousands more currently living and working in the U.S.

The lawsuit was filed by 18 welcomers, newcomers, and service members, in addition to organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. They are represented by Justice Action Center and Human Rights First.

“The Trump administration is fighting tooth and nail to delegalize as many people as possible, actively creating a larger class of people who are subject to deportation — made up even of those who followed the exact processes the U.S. government required of them,” said Karen Tumlin, Founder and Director of Justice Action Center. “Today’s ruling is an urgent and grave threat to all of us who believe in due process and equal protection under the law, and it has immediate consequences for hundreds of thousands humanitarian parole beneficiaries, their U.S. sponsors, and the communities throughout the country who have benefited greatly from their contributions. Our fight cannot — and will not — end here. We have already returned to the district court to seek a final ruling in this case finding this premature termination unlawful.”

“This has never actually been about ‘legal’ or ‘illegal’ immigrants, rather it’s about stripping the lawful rights from as many vulnerable communities as possible in order to advance a cruel and lawless agenda. Let us not forget that we are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them, yet continue to be targeted by the calculated cruelty of the Trump administration,” said Guerline Jozef, Executive Director and Founder of organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. “To our brothers and sisters in the CHNV program: we see you, we are with you, and we will continue to stand by you as we fight for justice.”

“This ruling is a devastating blow to hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants and their U.S.-based sponsors who welcomed them into their homes and communities, but this is not the end of our legal fight,” said Anwen Hughes, Legal Director of Human Rights First. “We remain firm in our belief that the Trump administration is needlessly and flagrantly flouting U.S. law, and we won’t let this setback keep us from fighting in the courts to pursue justice for our communities.”

For more than 70 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have established parole processes to advance important American interests, including promoting family unification, advancing urgent humanitarian interests, and enhancing migration management.

Rep. Mike Thompson, whose district surrounds the base on three sides, said he was relieved to get a letter last month from the Department of Defense confirming the proposal has been taken off the table, following strenuous opposition.

“I’m pleased, as is Travis, that they decided not to move forward with the detention center on the base. Nobody wanted it,” the North Bay Democrat said. “The base was against it, the community was against it, two members of Congress from there were against it.”

The push to build a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on the air base came to light in April through internal federal emails obtained by KQED. The emails showed significant coordination among Department of Defense and Homeland Security officials to expedite the plans and tee them up for approval by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The plan came as a shock to Thompson and Rep. John Garamendi, another Democrat whose district includes the base. They expressed outrage that the Trump administration had not informed them of the plan and concern that using military resources for civilian law enforcement could violate the Posse Comitatus Act and divert from missions such as supplying weapons to Ukraine and allies in the Pacific.

On May 5, the pair fired off a letter to Hegseth saying: “The decision to use Travis AFB as a migrant detention center would both constitute a dangerous militarization of immigration enforcement and unnecessarily degrade military readiness.”

For weeks, opposition mounted, with protests outside the base, constituents calling the congressmen and many local elected officials speaking out, including the mayor of Fairfield.

At a May 29 meeting of the Travis Community Consortium, Travis’ commanding officer, then-Col. Jay Johnson, reported that there had been talks about establishing an ICE facility on the base, but he said that plan had been taken off the table, at least for the time being, according to Garamendi staff who attended the meeting.

Finally, on Aug. 6, the congressmen received an official reply from Assistant Secretary of Defense M. Roosevelt Ditlevson that read, in part: “While DoD remains committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security within the framework of applicable legal authorities and through approved requests for assistance, Travis AFB will not be designated for migrant detention-related activities at this time.”

Garamendi and Thompson spoke about the shift in plans to KQED this week.

“The argument that Mike Thompson and I made carried the day. Travis is a critical element in our national security,” Garamendi said. “The role that Travis has as an international distribution center for military supplies, equipment, and personnel is critical to everything the military must do. And a detention facility would degrade that mission.”

Garamendi and Thompson called it a win but said they would remain vigilant, as defense officials have approved immigration jails on military bases in other states, including New Jersey and Indiana and a 5,000-bed installation at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

“With this administration, you don’t really have a clear understanding of what is going to change from one moment to the next,” Thompson said. “So we’re watching it. We’re in constant communication with the base personnel.”

Situating ICE jails on military bases can facilitate the swift removal of immigrants from the country. Although most deportation flights are conducted with ICE Air charter planes, the administration has also conducted at least 85 removal flights on military cargo planes, a new report from Human Rights First found.

Over the last year in California, ICE has held an average of roughly 3,600 people a day across six facilities, all of them private prison operations in Southern California.

ICE officials have been seeking a detention center in Northern California, which has a major ICE field office and three immigration courts — in San Francisco, Concord and Sacramento.

“ICE is exploring all options in California to meet its current and future detention requirements, which include new detention facilities and possible support from partner agencies,” an ICE official told KQED in a written statement in April.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/TravisAirForceBaseGetty3-1020x603.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 21:56:56.800850

BOSTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration can end legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Venezuela_Immigrants_21434_18ef51.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-09-12 21:57:45.864848

“An estimated two million people who did everything the government asked of them to come to the U.S. through parole can breathe a sigh of relief today,” said Hillary Li, counsel for Justice Action Center. “The district court issued its ruling after reviewing hundreds of pages of legal filings and overseeing hours of oral argument, and that order is as carefully reasoned as it is accurate. The district court recognized the importance of the declarations from direct service providers detailing the horror and harm of courthouse arrests on people all across the country and the urgency of this case. While we are grateful for this outcome, we will remain vigilant to continue to defend the district court’s win and ensure the government’s compliance.”

“We welcome the court’s decision signaling to the Trump administration that it cannot abduct paroled community members and separate them from their families, violating clear, established due process under the guise of expedited removal,” said Ama Frimpong, CASA’s legal director. “We will continue to fight against the administration’s cruel enforcement tactics to ensure that our entire community is protected from its overreach and abuse of power.”

“We will remain vigilant to ensure that our members and others on whose behalf we sued are not being subjected to expedited removal,” said Carl Bergquist, general counsel for CHIRLA. “This administration has tried to use these policies to cruelly and illegally shuttle people out of the country, and we will fight for people who lawfully entered under parole to be treated in the way that the statute demands.”

Tracey testified on behalf of both Justice in Aging and the Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities (CCD) Social Security Task Force, which Justice in Aging co-chairs.

During the hearing, Tracey urged Congress to ensure access to vital Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for older and disabled people who are able to and want to work. She pointed to bipartisan solutions for removing barriers to work, such as the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act. This bill would increase SSI asset limits, allowing more SSI recipients to keep their benefits while working and saving money for basic expenses and emergencies. Tracey also highlighted the need for adequate staffing at the Social Security Administration.

New Census Data on Senior Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage

The U.S. Census Bureau recently published its annual reports on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S. While other demographics saw poverty rates fall or remain flat, poverty rates for older adults increased and continued to be especially high for older adults of color.

Data confirms that safety net programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are critical for reducing senior poverty, with Social Security lifting over 28.7 million older adults above the poverty line. In 2024, under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the poverty rate for older adults was 15%, with older adults having the highest poverty rate among all age groups.

Seniors of color also experienced higher poverty rates. Approximately 24% of Black older adults, 19% of Asian older adults, 22.5% of American Indian and Alaska Native older adults, and 28% of Hispanic older adults were living in poverty. These numbers highlight the need to strengthen and expand the programs low-income older adults rely on, including Social Security, SSI, federal rental assistance, Medicaid, and Medicare so that older adults can age with dignity and the resources they need.

As for health insurance coverage, the Census data shows that in 2024 8.2% of people were uninsured. This is an increase from 2023, when the uninsured rate was at a record-low 7.9% due to COVID-related continuous coverage protections for people with Medicaid and enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The uninsured rate, especially among immigrants, is likely to climb more steeply in the next few years due to H.R. 1, which will take Medicaid, Medicare, and ACA coverage away from 10 million people. Another 4.2 million people—including many low-income older adults—will become uninsured next year if Congress allows the enhanced premium tax credits to expire in 2025.

Preliminary Injunction Stops Federal Agencies from Excluding Older Immigrants from Programs and Services

On September 10, a U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction in State of New of York vs. Department of Justice. The lawsuit was brought by 21 states and the District of Columbia against four federal agencies that issued reinterpretations of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

The reinterpretations were issued by the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Education, and Department of Labor in July 2025 and redefined the term “federal public benefit,” thereby excluding immigrants from eligibility for over a dozen federal programs.

Older immigrants are already severely restricted in the types of public benefits they can access. The HHS notice reinterpreting PRWORA would further impede immigrant older adults’ ability to access health care and other supports by implementing immigration verification requirements for programs such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and recipients of Community Services Block Grants.

The agency received over 500,000 comments from advocates and stakeholders over this action. The preliminary injunction enjoins the federal agencies from enforcing their reinterpretations of PRWORA in the states that are part of the lawsuit.

New Memo Issued on Public Charge, but Underlying Regulations Remain Unchanged

On September 5, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a policy memo to USCIS officers on public charge. The guidance does not change the benefits considered under the public charge test, and the Biden Administration’s public charge rule remains in place.

The new memo emphasizes that officers must strictly follow the relevant authorities when making inadmissibility determinations and reminds immigration officers to be critical of an applicant’s propensity to be dependent on government support. For example, if information is missing from an application for lawful permanent residency or adjustment of status, officers must request that information, and a failure to provide it will result in a denial.

Protecting Immigrant Families (PIF) has created an explainer resource about the memo. Justice in Aging will continue to monitor developments regarding public charge and educate our network about the impacts for older immigrants.

A federal judge in the state of Washington granted a preliminary injunction Sept. 11 that blocks the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from implementing or enforcing its directive that would prevent immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status, a Sept. 11 news release from the American Civil Liberties Union said.

The decision applies to any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants or other similar persons and applies to Head Start nationwide, according to the ruling.

Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, said she was relieved and ""really thankful"" the judge applied his decision nationwide.

""I think it makes tremendous sense,"" Mauer said. ""It really just, frankly, allows Head Start to keep doing what it's been doing, which is to serve kids and to allow parents to keep going to work.""

The Department of Health and Human Services said it disagrees with the court's decision and is evaluating next steps, according to an emailed statement from HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon.

Head Start programs are federally funded. They provide child care and health care services to children from birth to age 5, their families, as well as to pregnant women, who meet federal low-income guidelines or participate in public assistance services like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

In July, the HHS announced on its website it rescinded a 1998 interpretation of the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that HHS said ""improperly extended certain federal public benefits to illegal aliens."" It included Head Start as a program that must enforce immigration status as a requirement to participate. Previously, Head Start and certain other services were exempt from doing so.

In April, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The lawsuit challenged the Trump administration's actions against Head Start such as stopping funding, closing regional offices, laying off staff and banning activities related to ""diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,"" according to an April 28 ACLU news release.

In May, the ACLU filed a motion asking a judge to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the administration's efforts. Then in July, the Head Start associations amended the complaint to include stopping HHS' immigrant directive.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2021/11/02/PMJS/a5c1a117-12e4-4067-8c13-bc00bc388b1c-MJS_211029__SchoolYards_Allen-Field_P5.jpg?crop=4375,2461,x0,y713&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-12 21:57:15.824552

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

“It is interesting that since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of liberty right, including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict on some of these court cases recently,” Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas, told reporters before a roundtable discussion on migration issues hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University.

Trump in May signed an executive order creating a religious liberty commission, which includes Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York and Bishop Robert E. Barron of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota. Bishop Seitz noted their presence on the commission, saying, “a couple of our bishops belong to it; and there’s also an advisory committee, more bishops belong to it.”

“So we’re happy for the opportunity to dialog about these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging to an effort to really preserve those First Amendment rights,” he said. “And we hope, maybe, we’ll have a hearing.”

Religious liberty clashes over church’s need to serve migrants, faithful

The church has faced a number of recent situations where religious liberty challenges have intersected with immigration issues.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has waged an attempt to shut down El Paso’s Annunciation House, a Catholic nonprofit serving migrants.

Another flashpoint occurred over the effort to ensure that detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz,” a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, have access to the sacraments.

Catholic entities also were among the nongovernmental organizations that appeared subject to a probe by the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security about their work with migrants, although that suggestion was later walked back.

Additionally, the nature of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has affected the participation of some Catholics in worship and seeking the sacraments, with Catholic churches reporting emptier pews as a consequence.

In May, the Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being according to the church’s own teaching and canon law. But in July, over in California, Bishop Alberto Rojas of San Bernardino issued a dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass for the faithful if they fear for their well-being amid concern over immigration enforcement raids in the area.

Additionally, a joint report issued in March by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found that more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025, and that a majority of them were Catholic.

Sensitive locations policy raises church’s stakes

Ashley Feasley, the legal expert in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law, noted there is bipartisan support for long-standing restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

But when the Trump administration tried to alter that policy, they changed it for a policy that is “less clear.”

“I think this is an area, particularly if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about, you know, what is this policy?” Feasley said. “What can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and access to … the sacraments?”

“I think there are decision-makers there who would understand it that way,” she said.

At the roundtable discussion, Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia who studies the relationship between Catholicism and democracy, said the principles that “guide our reflection on immigration are threefold, one that human beings do have the right to to migrate, but also that countries such as the United States have the right and even the duty to regulate our borders.”

“But a third principle helps us to hold together those two principles that seem to some to be contradictory, that the work of immigration enforcement should be guided by justice and mercy,” said Flores, who is the author of “The Aesthetics of Solidarity: Our Lady of Guadalupe and American Democracy.”

Pastoral challenges and need for immigration reform

Panelists discussed the policy and pastoral challenges presented by a mass deportation effort.

Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami discussed traveling with the Knights of Columbus by motorcycle to pray the rosary outside “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“The Knights of Columbus was formed for immigrant Catholics, by the founder, Father Michael McGivney,” he said. “So immigration is part of our Catholic story, and that’s to our shame as Catholics that we forget that our grandparents, our great grandparents, were discriminated against precisely because they were Catholic.”

Archbishop Wenski said immigration critics sometimes claim the bishops support immigration “because they want to fill up their emptying pews.”

But he noted they have consistently advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, because “we have a problem in which we have people being broken by the law, not breaking the law.”

“The administration can say that they are enforcing the laws, and they are,” he said. “They are enforcing the laws, laws that are inadequate and antiquated.”

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration.
The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.
Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times, but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.
“The Directive imposes new obligations on Head Start agencies and strips away rights from immigrant families,” said Martinez, appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush.","Head Start preschool programs will continue to welcome all immigrant children regardless of legal status, federal judges ruled in two separate lawsuits this week as it blocked efforts by the Trump administration to restrict enrollment.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced in July that Head Start and other programs it administered would be limited to U.S. citizens and certain immigrants with legal status, upending decades where the rule has been not to check the immigration status of the participating babies and children too little for preschool.

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration. Another suit was filed by Illinois and 19 other states with Democratic attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia.

This week in both cases, Republican-appointed federal judges agreed to block the changes.

The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.

On Wednesday, in the case filed by the attorneys general, U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, halted the new rules while the lawsuit makes its way to trial.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly 30 years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has

misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government,” wrote McElroy, a Trump appointee, in her 60-page ruling. “The Court is skeptical of that.”

Then on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez of Washington ruled in favor of the Head Start advocates, issuing a nationwide injunction that prevents the proposed changes from taking effect.

Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times, but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.

“The Directive imposes new obligations on Head Start agencies and strips away rights from

immigrant families,” said Martinez, appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. “Agencies must publish proposed rules and allow the public the opportunity to comment before promulgating substantive rules.”

On behalf of the Illinois Head Start Association and other plaintiffs, Allison Siebeneck, director of the Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project at the ACLU of Illinois, wrote in a statement that the ruling “protects essential early childhood education for families across the country.

""This climate of fear increases the likelihood of circumstances that threaten our community's safety and the safety of our public safety officials, too,"" said Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.).

An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was trying to evade arrest and resorted to driving his car into the officers and dragging one of them, the Associated Press reported. The officer shot Villegas-Gonzalez, who was pronounced dead at a local hospital, where the agent was also taken to be treated for serious injuries.

ICE agents had stopped Villegas-Gonzalez and said he had a history of ""reckless driving"" and was an undocumented immigrant.

Erendira Rendón, chief program officer at immigration and economic justice group The Resurrection Project, said in a statement that the ""horrific incident in Franklin Park shows us the real danger that militarized enforcement creates in our neighborhoods.""

""A community member is dead, and an officer was injured,"" Rendón said. “These are outcomes that serve no public safety purpose and leave entire communities traumatized. Safe neighborhoods depend on trust, not fear. When federal agents conduct unaccountable operations in our communities, everyone becomes less safe.”

The shooting forced administrators at a nearby junior high school to place the school on lockdown.

The local news outlet Block Club Chicago reported that video of the incident was not immediately available.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat who has vehemently condemned Trump's deployment of federal agents—and potentially troops—to Chicago, called for the Department of Homeland Security to release ""a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.""

Thousands of Chicago residents have marched against Trump's decision to deploy ICE—possibly followed by the National Guard—to the city in an operation that the White House has claimed is being carried out in honor of a woman allegedly killed in a drunk driving accident by an undocumented immigrant around 140 miles away.

Also on Friday, residents protested at ICE's Broadview Village processing facility, where Block Club Chicago reported ""pushing and shoving"" took place between about 30 demonstrators and ICE agents in riot gear.

Community leaders say they're not deterred by the federal government's immigration crackdown, which has stoked fears among Hispanic residents regardless of their citizenship or immigration status.

""I feel very confident that we're going to have a great parade,"" Rita Rodriguez, one of the Fiestas Patrias organizers, told Houston Public Media.

The Fiestas Patrias parade, which celebrates the cultures of several Latin American countries and serves as a kickoff for Hispanic Heritage Month, is expected to have around 100 moving parts, with as many as 3,000 people participating, Rodriguez said.

This will be Houston’s first Fiestas Patrias parade in four years after a hiatus organizers attributed to COVID-19. Rodriguez said the break has contributed to ""a lot of buzz"" on social media.

The event also comes as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement at other Latino-centric events. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that immigration officers may take race into consideration when stopping individuals in the Los Angeles area.

""There's always that possibility because of that recent Supreme Court decision that pretty much gives ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] the green light to arrest anyone that they suspect as being illegal,"" said Sergio Lira, president of a Houston council of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. ""That really raises the concerns, raises the bar in terms of our Latino community. Anyone can be suspect and arrested.""

During a weeklong operation in August, ICE agents in Houston arrested more than 800 people, according to a news release the agency shared on Monday.

In spite of that, other Latino groups are leaning in to the celebration of Fiestas Patrias, the Spanish phrase for patriotic or national holidays. That includes FIEL Houston, a civil rights nonprofit.

""There's been so many bad news recently that we're looking for other opportunities for there to be hope for our community,"" Cesar Espinosa, FIEL Houston's executive director, told Houston Public Media. ""And part of that hope is a celebration of our culture, of our roots, of everything, and giving people the opportunity to come and enjoy themselves with their family.""

Rodriguez said it was difficult to predict or estimate how many people will attend Saturday's parade, largely due to the lengthy hiatus.

The parade begins at 10 a.m. Saturday at the intersection of Dallas Street and Bagby Street, traveling through downtown, and ending at Sam Houston Park.

Plaintiffs challenging the revocation of parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela hadn’t made a strong showing the move was arbitrary and capricious, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held Friday in reversing a lower court.

The US Supreme Court has allowed the government to move ahead with revoking CHNV parole grants, approving an emergency request by DHS to ignore a district court order blocking removal of those immigrants while litigation unfolds.

Thousands of requests for green cards or other temporary relief are still pending at DHS.

The agency has moved to dismantle a broad swathe of temporary humanitarian programs, discontinuing refugee resettlement, restricting asylum, and suspending entry through several parole pathways besides the CHNV process. It’s also sought to eliminate humanitarian relief for hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the US as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, including many Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans shielded by Temporary Protected Status.

Although it’s fighting multiple court challenges over TPS terminations, the parole litigation is one of the first cases involving temporary immigrant protections to advance to the appellate level.

A Boston district court judge found the terminations were likely unlawful because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a blanket termination of protections. But the Immigration and Nationality Act “favors an interpretation that the ‘case-by-case’ requirement only limits the Secretary’s discretion to grant parole,” and doesn’t limit terminations, Appeals Court Judge Gustavo Gelpí Jr., a Biden appointee, wrote in the opinion.

The case was also heard by William Kayatta Jr., an Obama appointee, and Lara E. Montecalvo, a Biden appointee. The panel focused on whether the termination decision was shielded from judicial review during July oral arguments. Because the appeals court decided in the government’s favor, it didn’t address questions about reviewability in Friday’s opinion.

The decision vacated a district court stay on parole terminations and remanded the case for further proceedings.

Presidents from both political parties have used parole authority to temporarily admit immigrants on humanitarian or public interest grounds, allowing them to apply for asylum or another form of legal status within the US.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered Trump's Republican administration to change its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs' lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately.

That ruling found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians.

TPS is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States if their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

William Weiland, an attorney with the Department of Justice, said the judge had not ordered the government to update its website. Weiland also argued in court documents that the Sept. 5 judgment did not take effect immediately unless specifically ordered.

Chen said in his Thursday order that the rule cited by the government did not apply to these types of cases. The previous day, he denied the government’s request to stay his judgment while it appeals.

Lawyers for plaintiffs say people with temporary protected status are at risk of losing their jobs and more. They submitted a court declaration stating that a San Antonio man detained in May was told he will not be released until the website is updated.

While criticizing the federal government, the Catholic leaders also explained at a Thursday panel discussion at Georgetown University how they are supporting worried immigrants. With President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda and ramped up immigration enforcement, they said, many families are wary of taking their children to school, going to work or church for fear of being detained and deported.

“The way that the immigration policies are enforced these days are not only destabilizing the life of the particular immigrant, but whole families, businesses, the life of children, whole communities, neighborhoods,” said Auxiliary Bishop Evelio Menjivar-Ayala, of Washington, D.C. “What I’m seeing in people’s eyes, is pain and a deep confusion. … Where do we go from here if we’re not welcome.”

Adding to those fears is a change made at the start of Trump’s second term that gave immigration officers more leeway to make arrests at schools and houses of worship — long considered off limits. This is being challenged in court by teachers and faith groups.

“For me, it’s very personal because I was a stranger and you welcomed me,” said Menjivar-Ayala. He crossed the U.S. border illegally in 1990 after leaving his native El Salvador during the country’s civil war. Now a U.S. citizen, he became the first Salvadoran bishop in the United States.

Helping keep hope alive in struggling families is a critical part of providing support, said Sister Norma Pimentel, a leading migrant-rights activist along the U.S.-Mexico border who spoke on the panel. She runs Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, a respite center for beleaguered migrants in McAllen, Texas.

She recalled visiting immigrant families at a detention center in a “terrible condition,” and being moved to tears.

“I saw Border Patrol agents looking at us, and they, too, were moved and were crying,” she said. “When I walked out of there, the officer turned to me and said, ‘Thank you, sister, for helping us realize they’re human beings.’”

Department of Homeland Security officials have maintained there will be no safe spaces for those who are in the country illegally, have committed crimes, or tried to undermine immigration enforcement. They have consistently said their efforts are intended to safeguard public safety and national security.

Catholic leaders at odds with Trump over immigration

Catholic leaders follow the church’s core doctrine against abortion and same-sex marriage, priorities they share with many political conservatives. But they’ve been at odds with the Trump administration on immigration.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.

In February, the late Pope Francis also issued a major rebuke to the administration’s plans for mass deportations of migrants, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.

At the panel, Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski highlighted the contributions of immigrants to the country’s economy.

“If you ask people in agriculture, you ask in the service industry, you ask people in health care, you ask the people in the construction field, and they’ll tell you that some of their best workers are immigrants,” said Wenski, who has served on the USCCB’s migration committee. “Enforcement is always going to be part of any immigration policy, but we have to rationalize it and humanize it.”

Wenski joined the “Knights on Bikes” ministry, an initiative led by the Knights of Columbus that draws attention to the spiritual needs of people held at immigration detention centers, including the one in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” He recalled praying a rosary with the bikers in the scorching heat outside its walls. Days later, he got permission to celebrate Mass inside the facility.

“The fact that we invite these detainees to pray, even in this very dehumanizing situation, is a way of emphasizing and invoking their dignity,” he said. “More importantly that God has not forgotten them.”

Los Angeles archdiocese suffers after immigration raids

In Los Angeles County, the Trump administration’s ramped up arrests of people suspected of living in the country illegally has upended life for tens of thousands of people. About a third of the county’s 10 million residents are foreign-born, and many are now trying to live without being noticed.

Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez said on the panel that the fear-inducing effect of immigration raids lowered attendance at Mass, and affected valuable church programs that mostly serve immigrants. The archdiocese is helping those being detained and facing deportation with legal and financial assistance.

“People are really afraid of going out of their homes,” said Gomez, the first Latino to serve as USCCB president. “A lot of the priests are telling me here in the archdiocese that at least 30% of the people attending Mass are not coming anymore.”

Panelists warn of fallout from immigration crackdown

The panel, which included academics and legal experts, lamented the suffering of children separated from their parents. Legal expert Ashley Feasley, who is with Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law, noted the millions of children who are U.S. citizens and have parents and other family members in the country illegally.

“When we think about the level of enforcement that is starting, occurring, and will intensify … we have to think about these families. What will they do? How will they handle it if a parent gets detained?” Feasley said.

Trump has portrayed his federal law enforcement surge in Washington as focused on tackling crime. But data from the federal operation, analyzed by The Associated Press, shows that more than 40% of the arrests made over the monthlong operation were in fact related to immigration.

“The president says that he’s enforcing these policies to make our cities safer, but if immigrants, if people are afraid of interacting with law enforcement, with police, reporting crimes, obviously they’re going to become targets of crimes,” said Menjivar-Ayala.

“This is not going to help to make our streets, our communities safer.”

Ministering to immigrants at the border

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, said it is crucial to continue informing immigrant communities about their rights

“We don’t stop at praying,” Seitz, chair of the USCCB’s Committee on Migration, told the panel.

“Prayer moves us to action, and that’s what we ought to be doing — to abide by our support, our love, our accompaniment, by being present to people who’ve been terrorized by the actions of the government.”

At end of the panel, Gomez said it’s important to remember that the United States is a country of immigrants.

“I think we’ll have immigrant reform very soon. That’s my prayer and my dream -- that we can get something done, finally, as a solution of these challenges,” he said.

The workers were met by family members and officials from battery company LG Energy Solution (LGSE), who is partnering with Hyundai Motors to build the plant in the US state of Georgia.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling: A September 8 Supreme Court “shadow docket” decision gave DHS a green light to resume carrying out sweeps and patrols targeting individuals based solely on “profiling” criteria like apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The underlying lawsuit seeking to halt this practice continues, but six Supreme Court justices decided to allow profiling to proceed while the case moves through lower courts.

Elsewhere in the courts: Updates on the administration’s effort to swiftly deport unaccompanied Central American children; its agreement with El Salvador for paid imprisonment of deported Venezuelan people; a decision calling for detention of all who entered the U.S. illegally while their immigration cases proceed; and a bit of good news—perhaps—for Venezuelan TPS recipients.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior: Updates on immigration enforcement surges in Chicago, Boston, and Washington; a new report on abuse suffered by deported Mexican citizens; a surge in ICE deportation flights to Mexico; conditions and deaths in ICE custody; the U.S. military’s role; and the economic impact of administration migration policies.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling

In a brief September 8 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court gave its approval, pending further consideration by lower courts, for aggressive immigration enforcement targeting individuals based solely on their apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The decision lifts a July federal district court order to halt such enforcement in Los Angeles, which an appeals court had kept in place during its ongoing review.

As a result, the New York Times explained, “For American citizens of Hispanic descent in Los Angeles—especially people who speak with an accent or work as manual laborers—that means they will continue to risk being stopped and questioned whenever they go out. They may see it as a necessary precaution to always carry documents with them in a way that other Americans need not.”

The high court’s six Republican-nominated judges voted to undo the stay on roving patrols and sweeps by armed, masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and supporting agencies, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing a concurring opinion. The three Democratic-nominated judges voted to keep the stay in place and wrote a dissenting opinion.

An aggressive operation, halted

Between June 6, when the Trump administration launched a large-scale operation, and late August, ICE and affiliated agencies arrested 5,210 presumably undocumented people in the Los Angeles area, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated. Especially during its first month, the operation featured frequent “roundups of random Hispanic people by armed agents,” as the New York Times described it, many of them caught on mobile phone videos shared widely on social media. Agents paid repeated visits to the same sites, while U.S. citizens of Latino descent reported being stopped more than once within spans of just a few days.

Analyzing ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, the Cato Institute’s David Bier found in early August that fully one-fifth of ICE arrests since January 20 were of Latino individuals taken off the streets with no prior criminal records and no removal orders. “This policy is a threat to the rights of all people in the United States,” Bier warned.

On June 20, several people caught up in these sweeps, along with Los Angeles-area legal defense groups, filed a potential class-action lawsuit in federal court. (The case is Vásquez Perdomo v. Noem.) On July 11, District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden appointee, granted the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, noting a “mountain of evidence” that the sweeps were violating people’s constitutional rights.

This order halted all “detentive stops” by immigration personnel without “reasonable suspicion” of undocumented presence in the United States. It specified that reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on four criteria indicative of racial profiling: “(1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.); or (4) the type of work one does.”

On July 28, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously kept the restraining order in place, denying the government’s request to stay it. The four listed factors, the two Clinton-appointed and one Biden-appointed judges found, “describe only a broad profile and ‘do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,’” legal analyst Chris Geidner explained.

ICE arrests dropped by 66 percent in the Los Angeles area following the restraining order, according to mid-August analysis of Deportation Data Project statistics by Cato’s Bier.

The Supreme Court lifts the restraining order

The restraining order is now lifted. The entire Supreme Court majority did not explain the reasoning behind its September 8 decision, which it rarely does when ruling, on its “emergency” or “shadow” docket, whether to keep policies in place while lower courts decide on their legality.

In his solo concurring opinion, though, Justice Kavanaugh asserted that a person’s ethnicity can be used as a “relevant” factor in determining whether an agent might stop someone. Kavanaugh voiced the view that when U.S. citizens are stopped, “questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.” This does not describe the experience of plaintiffs in the Vásquez Perdomo case, and appears to imply that people at risk of racial profiling must never avoid going out in public without proof of citizenship.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” read a dissenting opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

The case (not the restraining order) continues to move through the courts, with an appellate court hearing set for September 24.

“Going hard”

In the meantime, sweeps and patrols are resuming. Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief placed in charge of “at large” mass deportation operations in Los Angeles, tweeted, “quite frankly the poorly written ( very poorly) temp restrainig [sic.] order was the worst i’ve ever seen. We are going hard in Los Angeles today and are hitting a location as I write this.“ A DHS tweet promised to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles.”

Geidner, the legal analyst who authors the Law Dork newsletter, warned that the high court’s move “makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches or seizures, with significant worrying consequences for all people in America—whether you lack documentation to be in this country or are a citizen of it.”

A statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) office went further: “Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the Grand Marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles. This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws—it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses. Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”

“When ICE grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why,” read a statement from the named plaintiff in the case, Pedro Vásquez Perdomo, a U.S. citizen. “I was treated like I didn’t matter–locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Elsewhere in the courts

Unaccompanied Guatemalan children

In Washington DC federal district court on September 10, government lawyers retracted their earlier claims that, when they sought to send 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan children back to their country in the pre-dawn hours of the Sunday before Labor Day, they were granting the children’s families’ wishes to reunite them. Presented with evidence that virtually all of the children feared or were unwilling to return to Guatemala, Justice Department attorneys backed off from “family reunification” claims that they, and other Trump administration officials, had forcefully—and, it turns out, falsely—made on August 31. (See WOLA’s September 5 Border Update for a full narrative.)

The restraining order preventing the Guatemalan kids’ deportation expires on September 14. Attorneys representing the children asked Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee assigned to the case, to keep the deportations on hold more firmly with a preliminary injunction. They are also asking Kelly to add unaccompanied children of other nationalities to the class of plaintiffs. That includes a group of Honduran children who, according to the Arizona-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, are at risk of a similarly swift removal.

In a detailed analysis at LawFare, Anna Bower contrasted the August 31 response of emergency on-call Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who kept the Trump administration on a tight leash to prevent planes from departing with the Guatemalan children, with the energetic but ultimately unsuccessful performance of Washington DC Judge James Boasberg in March, during a similar administration attempt to carry out a secretive, high-speed removal to a prison in El Salvador. Bower argued that the judiciary is on a “learning curve” regarding the executive branch’s overreach and basic trustworthiness.

Venezuelan men rendered to El Salvador

Also before Judge Boasberg is a suit from several migrant defense organizations that seeks to halt and reverse the State Department’s transfer of funds to El Salvador to imprison migrants there after their removal from the United States.

Between March 15 and July 18, 252 Venezuelan men were held in that country’s notorious Center for Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) prison after the Trump administration sent them there, 137 under the little-used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Since their release and return to Venezuela, the men have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, physical torture, sexual abuse, and other mistreatment.

On September 9, a filing in the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights v. Department of State case revealed a key piece of information: the March 22 written agreement between the Trump administration and the government of El Salvador governing the use of the CECOT.

This document committed the State Department to providing El Salvador $4.76 million from the account of its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which is legally authorized to fund anti-drug, crime-fighting, and justice programs—not the foreign imprisonment of migrants without charge. The money is meant to help El Salvador cover “law enforcement and anticrime needs, which may include costs associated with the detention of members of the Foreign Terrorist Organization Tren de Aragua”—approximately 300 of them.

The agreement “did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” noted a statement from Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, one of the plaintiff groups. However, it did “go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

In a reference to “section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act,” the agreement with El Salvador signaled diplomats’ awareness that the State Department money had to comply with the Leahy Law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to foreign security-force units that grossly violate human rights with impunity. The Venezuelan men’s accounts of what they suffered in the CECOT (several cited in WOLA’s August 8 Border Update) indicate rather vividly that Salvadoran units did commit gross human rights violations after receiving U.S. aid.

At the New Yorker, reporter Jonathan Blitzer published a thorough narrative of the Venezuelan men’s experience, from their decisions to migrate to what they endured in U.S. and Salvadoran custody. The lengthy article explored the efforts of the Trump campaign and administration to portray Venezuelan migrants as a national security threat, often building on atypical or isolated cases.

Blitzer’s piece includes some new details and elements. It reports that, going back to the Biden administration, Border Patrol was “taking the lead” in elevating the Tren de Aragua threat, voicing a view that may not have been shared by investigative agencies like ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). It also recounts a “blond and light skinned” ICE agent grabbing by the hair, punching in the face, and swearing at a Venezuelan woman aboard one of the El Salvador-bound planes until another guard restrained him (the Salvadoran government rejected the rendition of a handful of women aboard the March 15 flights). And it includes further accounts of the constant beatings the CECOT guards administered: they “became so routine that the Venezuelans scored them on a scale of one to five—the higher the number, the worse the treatment.”

The most well-known of the Venezuelan ex-prisoners, Andry Hernández, gave a September 11 interview to Andrea Castillo of the Los Angeles Times. Hernández, a gay makeup artist apparently accused of gang membership because he had tattoos, recalled his six-month stay at ICE’s Otay Mesa Detention Center outside San Diego. “Immigrant detainees are given blue, orange, or red uniforms, depending on their classification level,” Castillo reported. “A guard once explained that detainees wearing orange, like him, could be criminals. Hernández Romero said he replied, ‘Is being gay a crime? Or is doing makeup a crime?’”

Prohibition of bond

Within the Justice Department, the Board of Immigration Appeals—which can review immigration judges’ decisions and set precedents—issued a decision that could signal a massive shift in immigration policy. The Board upheld a Trump administration policy requiring judges to detain all migrants who entered the United States illegally—such as those who crossed the border between ports of entry—while their cases proceed. This prohibition on bond releases could apply to millions of people.

The decision “is likely to send an immediate chill through immigration courts where judges for decades have released individuals on bond whom they did not deem a flight risk or danger,” the Los Angeles Times reported. In the past, detaining all improper border crossers would have vastly stretched ICE’s detention system far beyond capacity. Now, however, a $45 billion appropriation for ICE detention, part of the “big bill” that Congress passed in early July, has significantly expanded that capacity.

TPS for Venezuela

In a Northern District of California court on September 5, Judge Edward Chen ordered the restoration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 600,000 citizens of Venezuela. This reverses, for now, the Trump administration’s termination of TPS for Venezuelans. Chen argued that the administration did not follow procedure, including a careful review of conditions in Venezuela, when it curtailed TPS.

Judge Chen’s ruling “means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the United States. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians,” the Associated Press reported.

“Protections and employment authorization for Venezuelans are back in place until October 2026,” Bloomberg Law reported. “But they’ll have to re-register for TPS by Sept. 10.” However, that has been impossible to do, as DHS “hadn’t updated its website to show that the Venezuelans were still covered by T.P.S. and wasn’t allowing many of them to re-register as they needed to by a Sept. 10 deadline,” the New York Times reported on September 11. A government lawyer cited a “coding issue.”

On September 11, Judge Chen ordered that the website be operational within a day and that TPS recipients have sufficient time to re-register. It is not clear what, if anything, can be done for any Venezuelans who were deported after losing this now-restored status.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior

As funding from the giant budget legislation approved in July continues to come online, the administration’s operations to arrest, detain, and deport migrants from the U.S. interior continue to accelerate. In what has become a regular component of WOLA’s Border Updates, this section offers links to coverage of some of the principal developments.

Operations in cities

As noted above, agents from ICE, CBP, and other federal law enforcement agencies poured into Los Angeles in June. In August, a surge began in Washington, DC. In both of these cities, the civilian law enforcement deployments came with contingents of military personnel, mainly National Guard, who have been less directly involved in migrant apprehensions.

Now, the administration is launching operations—so far, just with civilian law enforcement agencies, not military personnel—in Chicago and Boston. These are reportedly modeled on the Los Angeles operation. (ICE also carried out a large-scale raid last week at a big Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia, detaining hundreds of mostly Korean citizens and triggering diplomatic tensions with South Korea.)

The administration has officially launched what it is calling “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. President Trump publicized it with a social media post featuring an AI image depicting himself in the role played by Robert Duvall in the movie Apocalypse Now, twisting Duvall’s famous line into “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” and threatening, “Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

So far, though, there is no indication that Department of Defense personnel are deployed to Chicago, although ICE, CBP, and other civilian personnel who have moved from elsewhere, mainly Los Angeles, are operating out of Naval Station Great Lakes, north of the city. In the operation’s first days, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, “Details were scarce as videos surfaced of masked federal agents taking people into custody, with a smattering of arrests from the South Side to the west suburbs.”

Gregory Bovino, the politically outspoken Border Patrol agent who began 2025 as the chief of the agency’s El Centro Sector and was tapped to lead the Los Angeles operation, is now in Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a vocal Trump opponent who has called Bovino “a guy who desperately wants to be a reality TV star,” said that the Chief’s reported arrival is “evidence that they have terrible plans for the communities of Illinois.”

Bovino tweeted a photo of himself accompanied by dozens of uniformed agents with the Hollywood sign in the background, with the text “The mean green team is not going anywhere. We are here to stay.” The Chief’s face is the only one not blurred out.

In the past two weeks, Bovino has been profiled by the New York Times, CBS News, and the Associated Press, which noted, “Bovino carefully hones his image, both his own and the one projected to the country that shows well-armed officers moving swiftly into place to make arrests.”

In Boston and elsewhere in Democratic-governed Massachusetts, the administration has launched what it calls “Operation Patriot 2.0”; the “1.0” version was a surge that led to 1,500 arrests in Massachusetts during the spring. “The operation began late this week and was expected to last several weeks,” two sources told the New York Times for a September 6 report.

The most visible aspect of the Boston operation so far has been a war of words with the city’s popular mayor, Michelle Wu, who ordered that “no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda.” In a September 6 statement, DHS retorted, “Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens.”

Washington “has transformed from a place that proudly welcomed immigrants into one primed for their deportations,” with DC Metropolitan Police now working closely alongside ICE agents “who have detained people in front of schools and restaurants,” noted a Washington Post analysis that featured the heavy hands-on role of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in directing the operation.

In the Virginia suburbs, where most out-of-state National Guard personnel are sleeping in hotels, an ICE raid on a construction site near the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) headquarters led some fleeing workers to try to scale the spy agency’s perimeter fence. The CIA, which ICE did not inform about the nearby operation, closed its gates for more than an hour.

With the school year now well underway, the Washington Post reported on a “walking school bus” that parents have organized to help children from mixed-status families feel at least somewhat safe on their way to and from classes.

Arrests

At her Beyond the Border newsletter, San Diego-based reporter Kate Morrissey noted that, since a court ruling against nationwide “expedited removal” has slowed ICE’s detentions of migrants reporting to immigration court (see WOLA’s September 5 Border Update), agents are now strapping electronic ankle monitors onto thousands who show up for their cases.

Now that it is no longer common for agents to start their workdays with specific individuals to target, NBC News reported that ICE no longer requires agents to complete a “field operations worksheet” with details about their targets. Instead, “broad street sweeps” with no specific targets are becoming the norm. “It’s hard to fill out a worksheet that just says, ‘Meet in the Home Depot parking lot,’” a former ICE official told the network.

Among the many federal agencies losing personnel to the mass deportation effort is the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service, Wired reported. Of the 2,500 officers on the force, which protects embassies and other U.S. installations, 600 have been deputized “to help with arresting and deporting illegal immigrants” and now must log the time they are spending on that mission.

Deportations

The Kino Border Initiative (KBI), which maintains a shelter near the border in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, released a report on the experience of deported Mexican citizens. Since April, the Mexican government has granted KBI personnel “regular access” to the shelter for deported individuals that it set up in Nogales at the beginning of the year, in anticipation of the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” campaign.

KBI staff conducted 278 brief surveys of returned migrants “to document patterns of repatriation, testimonies, and reports of mistreatment,” and the results are troubling. Fifty-seven percent of them had been living in the U.S. interior at the time of their arrest, as opposed to being apprehended upon arrival at the border: that is up from 5 percent of deported people last year. Of those apprehended in the interior, 57.5 percent had lived in the United States for more than five years, and 56 percent reported being separated from their families, “leaving behind children, partners, and other dependents.”

Since the Trump administration all but dismantled DHS’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) and Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the last five complaints—and nine of the previous 16 complaints—that KBI has filed on behalf of migrants who suffered abuse in U.S. custody have gone without even a response. “We have not even received the typical automatic acknowledgment of receipt that was standard in the past.”

At the Guardian, Maanvi Singh and Will Craft dug into leaked flight records and passenger manifests from ICE’s largest aerial deportation charter contractor, Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX). In just over 100 days, they found, GlobalX operated 1,700 ICE flights, carrying 44,000 people, including nearly 1,000 children and 22 infants; nearly 3,600 individuals were moved five or more times. Secretive transfers, family separations, and flights to third countries complicate the defense of cases in immigration court, including access to attorneys.

The August report of Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor, which takes up the work of recently retired Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, found a sharp rise in ICE deportation flights last month. The project recorded 240 removal flights in August, the most in a month since Cartwright began tracking in 2020. This included a striking 72 flights into Mexico’s interior, up from a January-July average of 21 per month. That is the most flights this project has ever recorded to a single country in one month.

ICE Flight Monitor observed that starting August 28, ICE flights into Mexico ceased and have not resumed. In a likely correlated development, Border Report noted a surge in land-border deportations into Tijuana during the first eight days of September: 74 deported individuals from San Diego each day, up from a February-August average of 36 per day.

Also in Tijuana, Border Report reported, the head of the non-governmental Migrant Pro Defense Council in Baja California, José Moreno, publicly accused municipal police of extorting deported people. Moreno alleged that corrupt cops are shaking down returned migrants outside the federal and Salvation Army shelters.

Spain’s El País reported on the secrecy and opacity of ICE’s deportations to third countries. July flights to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini “were not reported until weeks after they occurred, and the administration did not provide the identities of the deportees, who remain imprisoned in high-security facilities.” A Jamaican man sent to Eswatini despite the Kingston government’s willingness to take him, Orville Etoria, has disappeared: his lawyers “have been unable to contact him and fear for his safety.”

Eswatini, the monarchy formerly known as Swaziland, is the latest nation to which the Trump administration is threatening to send Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego García. The Maryland father whom the Trump administration mistakenly sent to the CECOT in March remains in ICE custody in Virginia with a judicial order not to deport him, as he considers applying for asylum: having left and re-entered the country, Abrego García may now be eligible to do so. The administration has stated its view that an asylum application would void Abrego García’s existing withholding of removal status, enabling his deportation to his home country, which he fled due to threats.

The government of Belize (population 400,000) has acknowledged that it is reviewing a proposal from the Trump administration to sign a “Safe Third Country” agreement, which would allow the U.S. government to send asylum seekers from third countries to seek protection within the Belizean system. “As of now, Belize has not agreed to the proposal, and further consultations are expected before any decision is made,” reported the local Love FM.

NBC News reported that downloads of CBP’s “CBP Home” app are dwindling as migrants are apparently choosing not to use it to “self-deport.” During five weeks in March and April, 356 people used the app to register their departures and, at least in some cases, to receive a $1,000 stipend, according to data NBC obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. However, DHS “didn’t respond to repeated requests” for updated figures. An estimated 91,000 people downloaded the app from within the United States, with most of them doing so during its first weeks.

Detention

At the 19th, Chabeli Carrazana documented the detention and deportation of Colombian mother Nicolle Orozco Forero, her husband, and their two young sons from Seattle after spending 21 days in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, a “family detention” facility that the Trump administration has reopened in Texas. Orozco Forero’s son has a serious kidney condition, but she said that Dilley staff only offered him ibuprofen.

CNN reported on the grim, even subhuman, conditions prevailing in what are meant to be temporary “hold rooms” at ICE facilities, particularly in Miami and New York. The agency’s “policies for decades have required the agency to keep migrants in cramped hold rooms like this for no longer than 12 hours,” but 18 percent of detainees are now in those spaces for more time than that. At the troubled Krome Detention Center in Miami, hold room stays now average more than three days. Mobile phone videos show “Men sleeping head-to-toe on a crowded floor, exhausted detainees blocking out fluorescent lights with face masks, and dozens of people using cardboard boxes as mattresses.”

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, a 32-year-old Mexican man who had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, for so long that he had graduated high school there, died on August 31 while in custody at the state’s Central Arizona Correctional Complex in Florence. He had been in ICE custody for three weeks. The cause of death is unknown, though a family member alleged at a GoFundMe page that Batrez Vargas died “alone, likely from complications of COVID-19, and without the medical attention he deserved.” He appears to be the 13th person to die in ICE custody since the Trump administration began.

At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf interviewed George Retes, a 25-year-old Army veteran and U.S. citizen who spent days in custody after Border Patrol agents violently arrested him—he said he tried to comply with their orders—in California. “Held in a jail cell for three days and nights, he was not allowed to make a phone call, see an attorney, appear before a judge, or take a shower to wash off pepper spray and tear gas that the agents had used.”

The Washington Post reported on the Trump administration’s plans to reopen prisons and detention centers “that were closed by the federal government years ago over concerns about violence, medical neglect, and systemic understaffing.” Many are located in very remote rural areas, where hiring is challenging, requiring significant overtime, and oversight is difficult. The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff reported on the administration’s fascination with “megaprisons,” guided by a hope that the facilities’ cruel reputations might succeed in “scaring more immigrants into voluntarily self-deporting to their home countries.”

The U.S. military role

The Washington Post and CNN reported on potential morale issues among National Guard personnel deployed to Washington DC. (While President Trump has ostensibly sent the soldiers on a crime-fighting mission, their arrival coincided with the ICE-led migrant detention operations discussed above.) An Army survey of media attitudes about the Guard deployment, accidentally sent to the Post, noted that September 5 social media posts “were assessed to be 53 percent negative, 45 percent neutral and 2 percent positive,” and highlighted “Mentions of Fatigue, confusion, and demoralization—‘just gardening,’ unclear mission, wedge between citizens and the military.” A soldier anonymously told CNN, “We haven’t gotten critically low on morale, but we’re falling fast” as they remain away from jobs and families with little to do in the nation’s capital.

The Trump administration’s plan to use military lawyers as immigration judges is unlawful and “should raise all sorts of alarms,” three former U.S. military Judges Advocate General (JAGs) turned law professors told Ilya Somin of George Mason University Law School. At the Bulwark, Adrián Carrasquillo saw the proposal to transfer them to immigration courts on six-month missions as “an obvious effort to expedite removals.” Seven active-duty and reserve JAGs told the New York Times of their “concern that they would be expected to simply rubber-stamp deportations of migrants as the White House’s desired outcome.”

Public opinion

A local Times-Tribune report from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, one of the state’s three largest majority-Latino cities to vote for Donald Trump, finds residents “grappling with their decision” and objecting to arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records. Despite those misgivings, however, many “still largely stand by the president.”

Podcaster Derek Thompson, co-author of the bestseller Abundance, told Vox that, amid deportations and self-deportations, 2025 could be the first year in history to see a decline in the U.S. population. A shrinking immigrant labor force could hit critical economic sectors: “little in life is more fundamental than the right to food, shelter, and medicine. So, it’s pretty important that immigrants play a disproportionate role in each.”

The mass exit of employed immigrants could be masking a deeper weakness in the U.S. economy, the New York Times observed: their involuntary abandonment of paid jobs may be creating openings at the same time that employers are cutting back on other hiring.

Essays

At his newsletter, journalist and author Garrett Graff warned that ICE’s recent expansion and unleashing mark a fundamental shift in American democracy. “We have never in US history seen a federal law enforcement agency operate the way ICE has operated this summer—it marks the arrival of a new style of domestic policing” marked by prioritization of immigration goals alongside weakening of due process, oversight, and accountability.

At the New York Times, Sabrina Tavernise adopted a globally comparative view of ICE and other federal agents’ insistence on wearing masks to hide their identity. “In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era,” she wrote. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” said Harvard University’s Steve Levitsky, co-author of How Democracies Die. “It just doesn’t happen.”

Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.","WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.

The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit.

“Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”

The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin.

The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture.

They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S.

Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.

Third-country removals

A deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee.

Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there.

The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.

The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country.

They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit.

The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents.

One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.

K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit.

Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents.

Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.

“The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-12 17:57:27.067366

Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.
It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” he said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

Immigration officials said it was unclear how long he had been in the country.","CHICAGO – Federal immigration agents fatally shot a man in the city’s Northwest suburbs who they say was resisting arrest and dragged an agent with his car, officials said on Sep. 12.

U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officials said that the man they were attempting to arrest ignored commands from federal agents and drove his car into an officer attempting to arrest him. The agent suffered multiple injuries and is in stable condition, according to an agency statement.

DHS said in a statement that the situation arose from an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien"" and that agents had ""conducted a vehicle stop to arrest"" the man.

""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,"" said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.""

The fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez comes about a week into Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area ordered by President Donald Trump. The White House has said a crackdown is aimed at ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Villegas-Gonzalez’s known criminal background included a history of reckless driving, immigration officials said. Immigration officials said it was unclear how long he had been in the country.

Manuel Antonio Cardenas, a Chicago-area attorney who represented Villegas-Gonzalez in his traffic cases, is calling for a full investigation into the fatal shooting.

""His charges were all driving related; they were not violent crimes,"" Cardenas told USA TODAY. ""There should be a full investigation. The tactics that are being used by ICE are leading to situations that can result in the loss of life and injury to people.""

Cook County court records show Villegas-Gonzalez had traffic violations in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2019. Charges against him included driving nearly 40 mph over the speed limit, operating an uninsured vehicle and driving on the left side of the road.

Cardenas said that when he last represented Villegas-Gonzalez in 2019 his client worked in construction.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/12/USAT/86118450007-d-697-dab-710-ad-49-d-3-a-73-ebb-53190-b-54-e-8.jpg?crop=799,450,x0,y42&width=799&height=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-12 17:57:43.120016

Tensions escalated further as protesters and Ice officers began facing off directly.","A man was fatally shot during a vehicle stop on the outskirts of Chicago by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers after attempting to flee the scene, according to officials, and another officer was injured during the altercation.

Ice released the following statement after the shooting: “This morning in Chicago, Ice officers were conducting targeted local enforcement activity during a vehicle stop, the suspect resisted and attempted to drive his vehicle into the arrest team, striking an officer and subsequently dragging him as he fled the scene, fearing for his life, the officer discharged his firearm and struck the subject. Both the officer and subject immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”

It continued: “The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital, the officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition, viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

The target of the stop in Franklin Park, to the west of Chicago, was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was an undocumented immigrant with a history of reckless driving, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary. She then echoed the statement by Ice regarding the dangers of social media videos.

The incident was first reported on X by the CBS immigration correspondent Camilo Montoya-Galvez.

He wrote: “An Ice operation turned deadly in Chicago today, after a suspect resisted arrest and tried to drive his vehicle into agents, prompting an officer to shoot the suspect, who has been pronounced dead, a DHS official tells me. The officer suffered severe injuries but is stable.”

The incident involved a traffic stop to check on what Ice said was an undocumented immigrant. It happened about six miles from where, separately, a day-long protest had been unfolding outside an Ice processing center in Broadview, Illinois, where demonstrators clashed with federal government agents on Friday morning. There were reports a demonstrator was shot in the leg with a pepper ball by enforcement officers.

A worker at a tire shop across the street from where Villegas-Gonzales was killed spoke to BreakThrough News, according to the outlet, saying: “I thought it was your run-of-the-mill car crash, because car crashes have been here all the time, so I thought nothing of it. That’s when my boss came out and told me, ‘Hey, something happened here.’ And I saw a huge police presence, military presence and FBI presence.

“So right now, the community is a bit scared about Ice and the military operations here in Chicago,” he added. “Franklin Park is heavily Latino and Polish, so I didn’t know that they were going to come here one day. It’s just, once it happens, you’re in shock, like you can’t believe your eyes.”

He also provided reporters with security footage from outside the shop, which included audio of what sounds like gunshots.

Police taped off the area and behind patrol vehicles a grey sedan could be seen that the man had been driving. It had crashed into a parked truck, and it could be seen that the driver’s side window was open.

A video taken by a bystander and uploaded to Chitown Crimechasers on Facebook shows Ice agents trying to get into Villegas-Gonzalez’ car. Yanking the car handle and eventually breaking the glass and unlocking the car from the inside.

The Ice agent lays Villegas-Gonzalez’ body on the ground before dragging it to a nearby sidewalk. Another Ice agent joins and both are kneeling next to him. He is seen moving Villegas-Gonzalez’ legs before the video ends.

A neighbor who did not want to be identified spoke highly of Villegas-Gonzalez with a small group of reporters and mentioned that Villegas-Gonzalez was a hard worker and a good neighbor.

One time, the neighbor recalled, Villegas-Gonzalez scraped the neighbor’s car, came over and offered to fix it. The neighbor said it’s been distressing to see social media posts about Villegas-Gonzalez.

“It’s such a sickening world that everybody’s celebrating his death,” the neighbor said. It’s just wrong, you know? He’s a human being.”

When asked about Ice’s arrest of Villegas-Gonzalez and the agency having said Villegas-Gonzalez tried to drive into officers, the neighbor said Villegas-Gonzalez “was scared 100%” and didn’t speak English.

Meanwhile, in nearby Broadview, demonstrations began at dawn and were set to continue until the evening. By late morning, several dozen people had assembled outside the facility, according to CBS News Chicago.

These incidents and some others are part of a surge of immigration enforcement into parts of the Chicago area in the last week as part of a crackdown pledged by Donald Trump, as neighborhoods have braced. He has threatened to send in troops to deal with crime in the kind of unilateral action taken by the administration in WashingtonDC, ongoing, and Los Angeles earlier in the year following protests there against Ice raids.

This would be expressly against the wishes of Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the state governor, JB Pritzker, both Democrats, who have condemned the saber rattling and called for resistance. By Friday troops had not been sent.

Crowds in Broadview could be heard and seen on video shouting “shame on you” towards officers and the facility.

At one point, a reporter observed Ice officers forcing protesters back while clearing the way for agency vehicles to pass through the crowd. Tensions escalated further as protesters and Ice officers began facing off directly.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614880ebdc98251c09db7173da72829dc3822ce4/275_0_2735_2189/master/2735.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=182cc6deffbfb21fa0126910f3a27af4",N,,2025-09-12 19:57:58.449321

The ruling came after Head Start associations in multiple states sued over the Trump change from this spring.

The directive “results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families,” Judge Ricardo Martinez said in his ruling.

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the early childhood program from low-income families, for comment.

The ruling accompanied another lawsuit by Democratic attorneys general that challenged the policy and won a temporary injunction in their own states Thursday.

Head Start has faced a chaotic situation since the Trump administration’s directive and threats to take away federal money from the program.

“As Plaintiffs enumerate, this chilling effect results in the immediate harm of childhood education loss, disability support, dual language instruction, and stable learning environments, leading to long-term harms in development,” Martinez wrote in his ruling.

Those running Head Start programs were encouraged not to take action when the directive first came out due to all the confusion behind it.

“But I think an important point is that it has a chilling effect, regardless, and that if you’re [an] immigrant family, regardless of what your status is in terms of legal permanent residence, or mixed status family or refugee or whatever it is, you’re legitimately scared of sending your child to an Early Head Start or Head Start program,” Melissa Boteach, chief policy adviser for Zero to Three, previously told The Hill.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/school_classroom_teacher_arizona_10262022_GettyImages-1244462780.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:27.339778

Democratic state lawmakers have opposed federal intervention and at a press conference on Friday decried the traffic stop that resulted in the death of Villegas-Gonzalez.

“What happened today should never have happened. ICE’s tactics have led to a loss of life in our community. Trump has created this chaos,” State Rep. Norma Hernandez (D) told reporters. “We will not stand for the lawlessness of these ICE agents.”

Immigration advocates said they will ramp up local community trainings to prevent adverse interactions with law enforcement agents.

“The Trump deportation machine is out of control. We need to remain vigilant in our community,” said Lawrence Benito, executive director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “ICE’s aggressive actions do not keep our community safe.”

The protest began at 7 a.m., and is scheduled to last until 7 p.m.

Protesters and agents clashed intermittently throughout the day. While agents have mostly stayed on facility property, at times groups of heavily armed officers have emerged from the entrance gates to push protesters back and allow vans carrying detainees in.

During those moments, protesters and agents have clashed. CBS News Chicago saw agents fire a couple of pepper balls into the protesters as well.

Uniformed officers have also been on the roof of the building, armed with long guns.

The demonstrators said the immigrant community is being unfairly targeted. They have chalked the street outside the facility with messages including ""America was built by immigrants"" and ""Love thy neighbor.""

""It is my duty to use my privilege to try to connect those who are most vulnerable,"" said Francis, a protester who did not want to share her last name. ""And I'm here to show that it is inhumane to be snatching people off the streets and using this office building as a detention facility. These are human beings, and we need to show our support and solidarity with them in getting ice out of Chicago and out of our streets.""

He said he's here to promote peace and stand up for ICE agents, who he has heard are getting death threats.

Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country.
It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.
Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement.
Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.","Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court quietly made one of the most dangerous immigration rulings in decades. In a 6-3 decision in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, the Court used its “shadow docket” to lift a lower court ban on ICE’s “roving patrols” in Los Angeles.

What does that mean in plain language? This means that ICE agents now have the legal cover to stop, question, and detain people based on appearance, language, accent, workplace, or any other marker that “looks suspicious” to them. In other words, the Court just gave its blessing to racial profiling on a massive scale—and they did it without a full briefing or hearing and without explaining their reasoning.

This is not just about undocumented immigrants. This is about every Latino in this country—citizen, resident, or otherwise—who now has to wonder if going to work, speaking Spanish, or standing outside a Home Depot makes them a target. And if the history of racial profiling in this country tells us anything, it’s that law enforcement will almost always lean on the “easiest” factor—skin color, accent, or language—rather than a combination of subtle clues. The Court knows this, and it green-lit it anyway.

The way the Court issued this ruling makes it even more dangerous. It wasn’t through a full hearing or a published majority opinion. The ruling was issued on the “shadow docket,” a process for issuing procedural orders and deciding rare emergency requests for relief but increasingly used to decide major issues—abortion, voting rights, and now immigration profiling.

Unlike cases on the “merits docket,” shadow docket rulings bypass the transparency of full briefing from the parties and oral arguments, and the accountability of written explanations. Without reasoning, there’s no clear legal guidance for lower courts or law enforcement. That vagueness is the point. It allows agents to abuse power while hiding behind the ambiguity of the Court’s silence. Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country. When justice is delivered in the dark, rights disappear in the daylight.

The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect all of us from unreasonable searches and seizures. Immigration enforcement has always lived in a gray zone where “reasonable suspicion” was enough to trigger an investigation. Reasonable suspicion was never supposed to mean race, accent, or the neighborhood you’re standing in. But this ruling opens the door for exactly that.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh even wrote that ICE can consider those factors in combination, as if law enforcement officers don’t already default to race alone when given permission. His argument that people will be fine as long as they carry identification shows a profound detachment from reality. How many of us walk around with a passport, a birth certificate, or even a Social Security card? And even if we did, what prevents ICE from detaining or assaulting someone before they get the chance to show it?

That is exactly what happened to Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen born in Los Angeles, who was thrown against a fence and assaulted by ICE agents despite screaming that he was an American. They confiscated his ID and never gave it back. Next time he’s stopped, what proof does he have left? Kavanaugh doesn’t have to worry about being profiled. His race, class, and position shield him. His arguments ignore the reality for millions of people who do not share his privilege.

And we have seen this all before. Arizona’s “Show Me Your Papers” law created open season for Sheriff Joe Arpaio to harass Latinos on nothing more than skin color and accent. New York City’s stop-and-frisk program turned Black and Latino men into daily suspects until courts declared it unconstitutional. Japanese Americans were interned en masse based solely on ancestry. Slave patrols once prowled for free Black people, re-enslaving them on the presumption they “must” be runaways. Racial profiling is not an aberration. It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.

Justice Sotomayor understood this when she wrote her dissent. She warned that ICE should never be allowed to stop people just for being Latino. She called the ruling a betrayal of constitutional values and a dangerous normalization of discrimination. She knows that the so-called “combination of factors” argument is just a slippery slope toward the same abuses we have always seen. She knows that this decision will not just sweep up undocumented immigrants but citizens and permanent residents alike. And she knows that once law enforcement is trained to see a community as suspect, that stigma does not disappear—it spreads and infects every part of policing.

Some people will dismiss this case as “just about immigration,” but they are wrong. This ruling destabilizes public safety itself. Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement. When entire neighborhoods fear that an accent, a workplace, or a face is enough to trigger detention, cooperation evaporates. Victims and witnesses stop calling 911. Families stop reporting crimes. Neighborhoods retreat inward, not because they don’t care about safety, but because the police have made it unsafe to come forward. ICE does not act alone. Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.

The Supreme Court knows how unpopular racial profiling is when exposed to daylight. That is why they buried this case in the shadow docket, why there was no full hearing, and why there was no majority opinion. They know that if people truly understood what had been decided, the outrage would be overwhelming. Instead, they normalized it quietly, trusting that the next election cycle and the next culture-war distraction would keep most people from noticing.

But we cannot afford to look away. This is not the final word—cases will continue, advocates will fight, communities will resist. But we need to be clear-eyed about what just happened. The Court sent a message to ICE: you are free to profile. And unless we push back, ICE agents will take that freedom and run with it, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Queens, and beyond. The question now is not just what ICE will do with this ruling—it is what we will do in response.

Will we accept a country where Latino citizens are forced to prove their citizenship on demand? Where language, accent, or workplace can be turned into suspicion? Where the Constitution bends depending on who you are and how you look? Or will we demand a country where rights are not contingent on appearance, where law enforcement cannot terrorize communities under the excuse of “reasonable suspicion”?

But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub.","He arrived in Alexandria exhausted and sick.

It was early April, and Amilcar Lisser-Posadas – shackled at his hands and feet – had been transferred from a nearby immigration detention center to this remote US immigration facility in Louisiana. He feared it would be his last stop before deportation.

He remembered the stench of the place. The packed jail rooms where hundreds of men were warehoused together with little access to showers, which sometimes spouted brown, rusty water – when they worked.

The 29-year-old, a father of two young daughters who are US citizens, had come to the US from Honduras and had previously been protected under the Obama-era program known as Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which halted deportation for many undocumented people who arrived in the US as children. He had entered as a nine-year-old but his Daca protection had lapsed.

In March, Lisser-Posadas was apprehended by police in Shelby county, Tennessee, for driving with an expired license and was turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). He had no prior criminal record. For four weeks he was moved around various Ice detention centers. He filed a legal request to Ice for permission to remain in the country, citing fears of targeted violence in Honduras. He received no response.

The Alexandria Staging Facility – as it is formally called – was “just not a place for human beings”, he said in a phone interview.

The isolated, Ice staging facility in rural central Louisiana has emerged as a hub of the Trump administration’s deportation machine. The center, which has operated since 2014, is run by the private corrections giant Geo Group. It is considered a “black hole”, by many lawyers, advocates and former detainees interviewed by the Guardian. Living conditions are deplorable, many former detainees have alleged, and there is almost no legal access to the center.

A four-month Guardian US investigation into the Alexandria facility has revealed a pattern of alleged due process violations, previously unreported accounts of neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays, despite the center’s intended use as a short-term detention facility. It also found that the facility adopted a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year that protect detainees’ welfare. Reporters relied on court documents, public records, internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) statistics, 911 calls and interviews with 10 people either formerly detained or deported from the Alexandria facility, or those with loved ones held there.

The investigation also reviewed leaked flight manifests from Ice’s largest airline contractor, Global Crossings (GlobalX). They underscore the critical role the Alexandria facility, which is within the grounds of a small regional airport, has played in Ice’s mission of rapidly transferring and deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The data, which covers roughly 100 days from Donald Trump’s second inauguration, shows that more than 20,000 migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport on Ice charters operated by the carrier at a rate of almost 200 a day.

“Louisiana is where people go to be disappeared,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “My concern about the Alexandria facility is [that] it is a black box.”

Visitors are not permitted, and it is the kind of place where mistakes can happen, giving officials “a convenient excuse to wrongly deport people”, Ahmed added.

“The only way to stop that is for people to have access to attorneys.”

In response to the Guardian’s findings, the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, did not address specific questions but said in a statement: “Any claim that there are inhumane conditions at Ice detention centers are false. Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.”

She added: “All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.”

A spokesperson for Geo Group also did not respond to specific questions, but said in a statement that the company was “proud” of the role it had played for over 40 years “to support the law enforcement mission” of Ice.

The statement added that all the company’s “support services” were monitored by Ice and the DHS to ensure “strict compliance” with the agency’s detention standards. When issues are identified by Ice, a company spokesperson said they were “quickly” resolved.

The Alexandria staging facility is supposed to be a short-term center that holds detainees for a maximum of 72 hours. It has a 400-person capacity, and detains only men. It is divided into four large shared rooms holding about 80 people and a separate cell block.

But the center is routinely holding people for longer than the three-day maximum, a Guardian review of anonymized immigration enforcement data reveals. Of the more than 28,000 people who were detained in Alexandria from January 2025 until late July, 20% were held longer than 72 hours. Since October 2023, analysis shows that 742 people have been held there for 10 days or more.

While immigration detention standards are not uniform, centers detaining people for longer than 72 hours are generally required to provide more services – ranging from personal hygiene to recreation to legal visitation rights – than those designated as short-term.

“What this analysis tells us is that there is a requirement for the government to provide 24-hour attorney access at this facility forthwith,” said Ahmed of the ACLU of Louisiana. “It is clearly not a short-term facility any more, if it ever was one.”

Lisser-Posadas was one of those held for an extended period.

He was detained in Alexandria for about 12 days, according to a family member who remained in contact with him throughout, and a review of dated Ice detainee locator screenshots. He described routine lockdowns and a lack of food. He was unable to change his clothes or underwear. He arrived in Alexandria with chest congestion, a fever and an ear infection that worsened over time. He received no medication until the last two days of his stay, he said.

Medical care at the facility is provided by Ice’s health service corps, which is a part of the agency’s enforcement and removals operation.

Lisser-Posadas remembered asking Geo Group guards repeatedly for an update on the status of his legal request to remain in the country.

“I was trying to make sure that I got an explanation. Why I was being brought there? Why they wanted to deport me? Why they were holding me there for so many days?”

Instead, he said, one staff member, a detention lieutenant, looked at him through a secure window. “She would look at me straight, and then start laughing,” he recalled.

Eventually, after staging a small protest by refusing to return to his cell, Lisser-Posadas was moved back to another Louisiana facility in the nearby town of Jena for about four days. He was then brought back to Alexandria and quickly deported to Honduras on a series of GlobalX flights that left Louisiana at 6am on 23 April. His request for deferred removal citing fear of persecution was never resolved.

“My heart broke,” he said. “I saw kids [on the plane], some were still in their school uniform. They were being deported with their families. There were pregnant women as well.”

The leaked flight records confirm there were eight children under the age of 16 booked on the same plane.

Lisser-Posadas spoke to the Guardian from a federal prison where he was being held after he was apprehended at the southern border trying to re-enter the US in May to reunite with his family. He is now facing deportation again.

The Alexandria staging facility is operated under the performance-based national detention standards, an extensive set of guidelines designed to ensure a “safe and secure detention environment for staff and detainees”. The standards reflect that immigration detention is designed to be non-punitive as it relates to civil rather than criminal charges.

Alexandria has been found deficient in a number of these standards, according to a review of Ice inspection reports from 2022 onwards, including specific shortcomings over medical care and the use of force.

But because the standards are not legally binding, deficiencies rarely lead to meaningful consequences.

The facility was inspected by Ice in February this year – the first such examination in Trump’s second term.

A contract seen by the Guardian, agreed between Ice and the local district authority, shows the site was granted a special waiver four days before the DHS inspectors arrived, which absolved it of certain medical screening standards. The standard – which states that all detainees must receive a medical, dental and mental health intake screening as soon as possible, but no later than 12 hours after their arrival at a detention facility – was waived from 21 February to 22 May, according to the contract.

The document notes “there shall be no public disclosures regarding this agreement” without approval by Ice and offers no rationale for the decision.

John Roth, the DHS inspector general between 2013 and 2017, described the revelation as “highly troubling for the population of detainees there”.

“The reason they wrote the performance-based standards is partly to avoid constitutional challenges on the conditions of confinement,” Roth said. “To the extent you are deviating from that in any way, you run into trouble.”

The DHS declined to provide a comment on Roth’s statement.

Alexandria passed the February inspection without any deficiencies. Inspectors with the DHS’s office of professional responsibility noted in their report that 13 detainees had been interviewed who all “reported satisfaction with facility services”.

Roth argued the facility should face an immediate independent audit, describing the most recent inspection as holding “no validity because there is no detail behind it”.

A review of 911 calls, released by local emergency authorities, reveals that the facility has seen a spike in emergency call-outs since 2023, under the Biden administration. This year, between January and the end of May, there was an average of more than two 911 calls per month, a rate that – if it persists – would put 2025 on track as the year with the most calls in recent history. On 19 March, a staff member frantically called 911 to report a detainee had attempted to hang themselves. “We need an ambulance, emergency ASAP,” says a panicked staffer at the facility. “What’s going on in there?” Another person can be heard shouting in the background. Five days earlier the center called to report a man with a history of stroke had passed out. Next month, the facility called requesting an ambulance for a detainee with low oxygen and high heart rate. In May, a call was made after an apparent episode of self-harm.

McLaughlan, the DHS assistant secretary, said: “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters Ice custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

She added: “The Alexandria Staging Facility is in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody.”

The Alexandria facility began operations over a decade ago, costing about $20m to construct, at the end of a deportations peak during Barack Obama’s second term. Louisiana now detains more migrants per capita than any state in the US. The facility, one of nine privately operated centers, sits as the effective nucleus in the middle of “detention alley”, the network of remote immigration detention centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Geo Group, which manages the Alexandria facility, donated $1m to a Trump supporting political action committee during the 2024 election. Its CEO predicted the new administration’s mass deportation agenda could increase revenue by an additional $400m annually. It was reported in May that Trump’s hard-right border czar, Tom Homan, was a paid consultant for Geo Group before joining the administration. A White House spokesperson has said Homan abides by “the highest ethical standards”.

The former acting head of Ice, Todd Lyons, has said the administration wanted to turn Trump’s deportation machine into “[Amazon] prime, but with human beings”. It has already begun attempting to replicate Alexandria’s functionality in other states, with new detention centers in Florida and Texas constructed in close proximity to runways. But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub. On 21 July 2025, the facility saw its highest detained population since 2023, with nearly 500 people held there – almost 100 people above its stated capacity.

A spokesperson for Geo Group did not dispute the Guardian’s findings on capacity numbers but said that the company’s facilities “are never overcrowded”.

The detention center is set within the grounds of a second world war-era airpark, once an air force base, and now a minor regional airport complex that sees a small handful of commercial flights each day. In July, the Guardian observed from a third-floor observation deck inside a red-bricked terminal building as a cluster of large Ice charter jets landed in quick succession and taxied towards the detention center out of public view.

Although the entrance to the center is situated on a restricted road, the site is partially surrounded by an 18-hole golf course. From the vantage point of the 13th hole, a reporter observed as dozens of shackled detainees, including a line of young women, were driven on to the tarmac in minibuses and escorted under guard to a queue of six planes. The asphalt shimmered in the searing heat and many bent their heads as they walked towards their flights. Golfers teed off just a few hundred feet away.

Of the 39 Ice flights that day, 23 July, over half either departed or landed in Alexandria, according to tracking data shared with the Guardian by the immigration advocate Tom Cartwright, highlighting its centrality to the mass deportation agenda.

Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, an immigrant community leader and father of one, remembered taking a similar walk across the tarmac when he was deported in the early hours of 14 May 2025.

He had been arrested by Ice less than 24 hours earlier and driven at extraordinary speed from Carthage, Mississippi, 250 miles to Alexandria – the sole passenger in the back of a government SUV.

He repeatedly asked staff in Alexandria to call his family or a lawyer, but was denied telephone access, he claimed. Emails reviewed by the Guardian confirm he was deported before his lawyer could find him. Although facing a removal order, Orozco-Juarez held a valid work permit and a pending legal application to remain in the US.

“They made us walk slowly,” he said in a phone interview from Guatemala. “They just laughed. Laughed at the way we walked. The way we got on the plane. They treated us so badly.”

His attorney, Jeremy Jong, described the deportation as “a targeted kidnapping”.

“And I would ask: is this the system that we want? Where someone can be deported in the middle of the night, without access to their lawyer.” Jong added. “Is that a system that treats everyone with dignity and respect?”

Badar Khan Suri remembered landing in Alexandria with little comprehension of where he was.

He was marched single file in shackles from a jet parked about 50 meters from the detention center and held in a waiting area lined with metal benches for over an hour. He claimed in an interview that a security guard forcefully spread his legs and punched him in the ankles as they eventually removed his restraints and took him to a cell block.

Leaked flight manifests confirm Suri was flown to the staging facility on 18 March 2025 on a packed GlobalX flight from Richmond, Virginia, in mid-afternoon.

Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University in the US on a valid academic research visa, was one of a group of immigrant students targeted by the Trump administration for their criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. He had been arrested in Virginia, detained, and then flown over a thousand miles to Louisiana without the ability to contact a lawyer or his family.

He was held in Alexandria for three days, inside a windowless cell under rolling lockdown, which intensified his claustrophobia and panic. He said he could not recall speaking to a government representative for his entire time in Alexandria and was given no official answers about why he had been detained or where he was being sent. He feared deportation at any moment.

He had not been fully processed into Ice detention, he said, and so was unable to use a phone within his cell block for longer than 20 seconds. He would ring his family back in Virginia at regular intervals and hear their panicked voices, but they were unable to hear him speak as his line was muted, he said.

“I was able to hear my wife’s voice, my children in the background. But they never responded to my call,” he said. “‘Who is there? Can you hear me?’ they would say. And if I wasn’t able to connect to them, I would think: ‘What has happened? Maybe someone has also taken them away too.’”

The staging facility has no space for confidential legal calls, no visitation capacity, or attorney client meeting room, according to multiple attorneys who have visited the center on Ice approved tours. Lawyers who have tried contacting clients held in Alexandria have said the only way to do so is to directly contact the Ice field office director for the entire region to facilitate a phone call.

Ice’s national detention standards on telephone access state detainees and legal counsel should “be able to communicate effectively with each other” and that privacy for legal phone calls “shall be ensured”.

Geo Group said it provides “in-person and virtual legal visitation”, but declined to comment on Alexandria specifically.

Suri’s immigration attorney Hassan Ahmad confirmed he was eventually able to contact him via the Ice field office director. The phone call was brief and the two spoke in Urdu as Ahmad “couldn’t be assured of confidentiality” and could hear an Ice officer present in the background.

Suri was transferred from Alexandria by van to a detention center in Alvarado, Texas, the next day. Eventually, on 14 May, he was released and continues to fight his immigration case back in Virginia. It was the same day that Orozco-Juarez was removed from the US.

“This [center] should not exist,” said Suri. “There should be detention centers with due process.

“At that time [in Alexandria], I realized there is nothing called rights. It was a real black hole. A real disgrace.”

He continued: “Who are the people detained there? Those people are married to American citizens. They have American children. They are an integral part of American society.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de4ab980efb18c5541f5f95f2224a4efd5d8a70/0_1032_2400_1920/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22bce75bb2643a0b7081b0c768509ff1",N,,2025-09-12 17:57:48.060536

""We believe it would not be right to hold a celebration at a time when members of our community may not feel safe attending,"" the city of Everett said.

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained.","On Thursday afternoon, a Korean Air flight carrying more than 300 South Korean workers who’d been previously detained by U.S. immigration officials left Atlanta for South Korea. The flight ended a weeklong diplomatic tussle between the United States and the South Korean government that began when ICE officials raided a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Savannah, Georgia, and arrested nearly 500 people including hundreds of South Korean nationals.

The Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

The ICE raid, which came just 11 days after President Donald Trump sat down with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, is having far-reaching implications — and is a glaring example of how the Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

Homeland Security officials boasted that the Hyundai raid was the “largest single-site enforcement operation” in the agency’s history. But, not surprisingly, in South Korea the detentions were met with outrage from across the country’s political spectrum.

South Korea is reportedly the largest foreign direct investor in the United States and the country’s sixth largest trading partner. As part of a recently reached trade deal, South Korea agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S. to help revitalize the country’s manufacturing sector.

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained. ICE officials released videos of the workers with shackles on their arms and feet. “Is this any way for the US to treat an ally?” asked the left-leaning South Korean news outlet Hankyoreh, while the country’s most prominent conservative outlet, Chosun Ilbo, labeled the raid a “merciless arrest operation … that cannot happen between allies.”

These were workers with visas that allowed them to be in the United States, but the ICE videos made it appear that they were nothing more than common criminals. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Seoul’s foreign ministry said the Trump administration wanted to transport the workers in handcuffs but yielded when South Korea objected that they weren’t criminals.

President Lee has suggested that the raid is creating a “very confusing” situation for Korean companies and may lead some to question whether they should be doing business in the United States.

That’s already happening. Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

But of far greater significance, South Korean businesses have suspended at least 22 U.S. projects in the United States, many of them geared toward opening new manufacturing facilities.

South Korean engineering companies are frequently hired by American companies to set up new manufacturing facilities because it can be difficult to find American workers with the necessary skills.

But once that initial work is done, U.S. employees work the factory floors. The Hyundai-LG facility in Georgia is supposed to employ 8,500 workers. Now, all of that is on hold. Multiply that disruption across nearly two dozen factories, and potentially hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs could be affected.

Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

Part of the challenge for South Korean companies is that they have struggled to get long-term visas for their employees to enter and work in the United States. Indeed, many of those who were picked up may have been bending visa rules, but rather than look for ways to resolve this issue, the Trump administration sent ICE in.

According to a spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry, since Trump’s inauguration, it reached out 52 times to administration officials regarding visas for highly skilled workers — but to no avail.

According to Jenny Town, director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, “the longer this situation goes on, the less likely [South Korean] companies will want to bring their employees into the United States. It’s completely self-defeating for what the Trump administration has been lobbying other countries to do as far as investing in the U.S.”

While the repatriation of the South Korean workers is an essential first step, the Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul. When the South Korean foreign minister met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the State Department readout made no mention of the LG raid. Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, even went so far as to claim that the raid is “a great opportunity for us to make sure that all companies are reassured that when you come to the United States, you’ll know what the rules of the game are.”

Suffice it to say, that is not the view in South Korea. It’s not hard to imagine that other countries looking to invest in the United States will look at what happened in Georgia and decide that the risk to their workers is not worth it.

But there are also larger political implications as well. According to Town, polling in South Korea ahead of the Trump-Lee summit showed little public support for the trade deal with the United States, with many asking, “What does South Korea get out of it?” Those views have metastasized since the LG raid. These events put “greater and greater pressure on Lee’s presidency,” said Town, “and give him less political space to address the U.S. bilateral relationship.” Moreover, the U.S. is South Korea’s largest foreign direct investment destination. “Much of that,” says Town, “may be in jeopardy.”

The Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul.

Or more directly, the Trump administration’s moves to increase manufacturing jobs are taking a back seat to the laser-like focus on deporting as many people as possible. It’s hard to separate the zealousness of the LG-Hyundai raid from the White House diktat, per deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, that ICE meet a quota of three thousand arrests a day.

In fact, Tori Branum, a MAGA congressional candidate in Georgia, is taking credit for tipping off ICE about the alleged issues at the LG-Hyundai plant. For wannabe MAGA politicians, pointing the finger at potential immigration violations takes precedence over the creating jobs and growing the economy.

This is the political bind in which Trump and his supporters have put themselves.

Franklin Park is located about 20 miles from downtown Chicago. The northwest suburb is directly south of Chicago O’Hare International Airport.

According to the agency, officers targeted Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, whom they claimed had a history of “reckless driving,"" though the agency did not specify what exact crimes he has been charged or convicted of. He allegedly refused to follow the agents’ commands and drove his car at law enforcement, striking one agent.

ICE said that agent was “fearing for his own life,” and fired shots, killing Villegas-Gonzalez.

Friday’s shooting comes days after DHS launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” a new immigration enforcement operation across Chicago and Illinois that the department says will “honor” Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was killed in a January car crash.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Friday said he was aware of the “troubling incident that has unfolded in Franklin Park.”

“This is a developing situation and the people of Illinois deserve a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability,” he said in a social media post.

Despite the long-standing policy and practice of USCIS to allow corrections for deficient signatures, USCIS has shifted its approach.
There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures: There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement.
USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process.
The Covid-era requirement to retain an original was not carried forward in the updated guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual.","Unlike most federal agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not transitioned to electronic filing on a widespread basis, but still relies heavily on paper-based filings for most petitions involving work authorization, extension of legal status, and permanent residence. For these paper-based filings, USCIS does not allow electronic signatures such as DocuSign or other electronic services that allow a person to type a name or accept terms which then inserts a script font signature on the document. Instead, USCIS requires a handwritten signature, consistent with how a person signs their name.

USCIS has long recognized that a signature on immigration petitions does not have to be legible, in English, or in cursive so long as it is handwritten1. Also, the USCIS policy has historically recognized that the regulations do not require an “original” or “wet ink” signature on a petition, although in practice USCIS was inconsistent, often requiring original signatures for some petitions but not others2. With the emergence of remote work during the Covid-era, USCIS began universally accepting reproduced copies of signatures for “all benefit petitions.”

Recently there has been an increase in denials, preceded by USCIS issuing a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny where USCIS has requested “the original signed document…..that consists of the original wet signature3”. However, these requests are less about USCIS not accepting “scanned” copies of the signed forms and more about USCIS’ interpretation of “handwritten” signatures. Specifically, USCIS requests the “original” form signed by a party to determine whether the person wrote their signature directly on the form or instead applied their handwritten signature.

When a petitioner cannot produce the form with the original handwritten signature directly on the form, the USCIS has denied such petitions, concluding that a handwritten signature that a petitioner digitally “affixes” to a form is not comparable to a petitioner handwriting the signature directly on the form. Even when a petitioner submits replacement pages with a newly-signed original handwritten signature, along with a sworn statement affirming that the original filing contained their signature and they agreed to the petition’s contents, USCIS has still refused to accept it as sufficient to prevent denial.

Unfortunately, a denied case can have severe consequences. While some parties may refile a case by resubmitting a new petition and repaying the filing fees, others have no recourse because of missed deadlines. Even cases where refiling is possible, the consequences can be severe: a foreign national losing employment authorization or valid status. Although those affected by USCIS denials based solely on technical signature issues may seek legal action in court, the real solution lies with USCIS to ensure fairness to the public and avoid additional administrative burden for the agency.

The problem behind the increase in denials based upon signatures is USCIS’s refusal to allow a party to correct alleged signature deficiencies during the adjudication process. This action contradicts long-standing USCIS policy and practice.

In 2016 USCIS issued the “first formal written guidance on the meaning of the regulatory requirement with respect to signatures4”. Among other things, that guidance recognized a distinction between signatures which USCIS deemed deficient upon intake compared to signatures USCIS deemed deficient during adjudication. Thus, USCIS announced its policy that USCIS would reject a petition and return it to the person with the refunded fees; however, if the USCIS had reason to question a signature after a case is accepted for processing, USCIS may ask the person to sign the petition. This recognized that impact of a denied case: non-refundable filing fees, lost time, and personal consequences such as loss of status, employment authorization, and eligibility for certain immigration options.

Despite the long-standing policy and practice of USCIS to allow corrections for deficient signatures, USCIS has shifted its approach. USCIS is referencing updated guidance in the USCIS policy manual which states, “USCIS does not provide an opportunity to correct (or cure) a deficient signature.5” Although that statement in the updated Policy Manual immediately follows the sentence about USCIS rejecting petitions at the time of filing, where fees are fully refunded, USCIS has extended that interpretation to cases where it determines a signature is deficient while adjudicating a petition that has been pending for months or even years.

The solution to the current uptick in denials for deficient signatures is simple: USCIS should reinstate its longstanding policy and practice allowing a party to correct deficient signatures. This would ensure otherwise meritorious cases are not denied solely for technical errors, subjective interpretations, or confusion about the signature requirement.

There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures:

There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement. Beginning with Covid-19 and the transition to remote-work, USCIS began accepting reproduced copies of signatures for all petitions6. Some interpreted “reproduced copies of signatures” to mean that a handwritten signature could be reproduced and affixed on a form, whereas USCIS apparently intends it to mean only that a form can be reproduced after a petitioner handwrites their signature directly on the form. Assuming arguendo that USCIS is correct, it’s reasonable for the public to be confused about the meaning of reproduced copies of signatures especially since the USCIS Regulations, the binding authority on signatures, simply state the signature must be “handwritten”, not that it has to be handwritten directly on the form.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than courts. Courts in the U.S. generally accept electronic signatures because federal laws like the E-Sign Act and state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) give electronic signatures the same legal effect as pen-to-paper or “original” signatures7. In contrast, the USCIS does not allow electronic signature services such as DocuSign, which is why some petitioners who work remotely or otherwise don’t have easy access to a printer and scanner have resorted to handwriting their name and digitally affixing it to a form when needed.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than other federal immigration agencies. The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) allows handwritten, digital, and electronic signatures on all documents filed with an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), regardless of whether the filing is by mail, in person, or electronically. The EOIR Policy states that a signature can be a “reproduction of the signer’s handwritten signature.""8 Similarly, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) allows both electronic signatures and reproduced copies of a handwritten signature for Form I-20 and Form I-983, documents related to legal status and work authorization of international students. The ICE policy guidance includes “reproduced copies of a signature,” meaning “a digitally reproduced copy may be a scanned image of a physical signature.” These same forms, I-20 and I-983, are included in immigration petitions with USCIS as evidence of a foreign student’s legal status.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS policy. USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process. This policy was memorialized in USCIS Policy Memorandum in 2016, recognizing that an ability to cure does not apply to petitions rejected in the USCIS mailroom and returned to petitioners with a refund, but does apply when USCIS questions a signature in the course of adjudicating a pending application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS practice. For almost a decade since the USCSI written policy to allow a party to correct a signature during adjudication, USCIS followed that practice. USCIS issued countless requests for evidence and notice of intent to deny requesting the petitioner or beneficiary to “create replacement pages and submit with the original signatures.”

The ability to cure a deficient signature during the adjudication process is equitable. Under current USCIS practice, USCIS timely returns a petition and refunds filing fees for those who are “lucky” enough to have USCIS reject a case upon filing for a deficient signature but retains the filing fees for those deemed deficient during adjudication, not to mention the harm in the time of processing. Due to USCIS processing times, certain cases that are subject to this new USCIS opinion that deficient signatures cannot be corrected during adjudication are cases filed when USCIS was operating under the long-standing policy to allow corrections.

The ability to cure a deficient signature is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. The filing fees for immigration petitions are costly, often thousands of dollars. Refiling a denied petition involves repaying the fees. Worse yet, sometimes refiling is not an option. For example, if USCIS denies an H-1b cap petition after the filing deadline, the petitioner loses the opportunity for that H-1b for the entire fiscal year. Moreover, the impact escalates if the beneficiary does not get selected in the H-1b lottery the following year. Similarly, in immigrant petitions where the priority date is based on the receipt date at USCIS, a denial results in loss of the filing date, which can delay the permanent residence process by several years. With processing times more than one year for I-140 petitions and multiple years for I-130 petitions, having to “restart” the clock by refiling is significant. A denial may also jeopardize a foreign national’s legal status, work authorization, or ability to include a dependent child nearing the age limit on permanent residence application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature is efficient for USCIS. The USCIS denials for alleged deficient signatures results in refiled petitions or appeals - adding work to an agency that is already understaffed and overburdened with volume of cases. Moreover, parties with cases that are not eligible to refile or appear – such as H-1b cap cases that are deadline-sensitive – may opt to sue USCIS, burdening not only USCIS but the court system.

The ability to correct a deficient signature recognizes substance over form. The purpose of a signature is to validate the identity of the signer and the intent/consent of the signer. For petitions with USCIS, a signature signifies the requester’s consent to three things: (1) the person knows of the content of the request and any supporting documents; (2) the person has reviewed and approves of any information contained in such request and any supporting documents; and (3) the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the request and any supporting documents are true and correct. The method of signature should not override the identity and intent of a party.9 Immigration law - including the right to live and work in the United States - should not hinge on a technicality involving the method of a signature when the intent of the signer is clear and verifiable.

Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sign” as “to affix one’s name to a writing or instrument, for the purpose of authenticating it, or to give it effect as one’s act”.10 If USCIS deems a party’s handwritten signature unacceptable because he affixed it to the USCIS form, USCIS should, at a minimum, allow the party to correct the deficiency by re-signing the form during the adjudication process. does not recognize a person’s handwritten signature that he affixes to a petition as acceptable, USCIS should at least allow such a person to correct a deficient signature during adjudication. The real solution – addressing not only denials but also the additional workload on USCIS from re-filings and appeals– is for USCIS to allow a party to correct a deficient signature during adjudication.

The traffic stop took place in suburban Franklin Park on Friday, which is located near O’Hare International Airport, officials said.

Both the officer and the migrant, identified as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital, officials said. Villegas-Gonzalez was pronounced dead at the hospital, officials confirmed.

The officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition. Officials said that Villegas-Gonzalez resisted officers commands during the traffic stop before he drove his vehicle into the team of arresting officers.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

McLaughlin added: “Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

Officials said Villegas-Gonzalez has a history of reckless driving and entered the United States illegally at an unknown time and place.

“Operation Midway Blitz” was launched on Monday by Department of Homeland Security officials. On Wednesday, DHS officials confirmed to NewsNation that 13 migrants who entered the United States illegally, who the federal agency considers “the worst of the worst,” had been arrested within the first three days of the operation.

This report is part of “Upheaval Across America,” an examination of immigration enforcement under the second Trump administration produced by Carnegie-Knight News21. For more stories, visit https://upheaval.news21.com/.

In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, US Army veteran Sae Joon Park kept in mind a warning from an immigration officer: If Donald Trump were elected, Park would likely be at risk for deportation.

Park was just 7 when he came to the US from Seoul, South Korea. A green card holder, he joined the Army at 19 “to serve the country that I believed in,” he said. He received a Purple Heart after being shot twice while deployed in Panama, but after leaving the military, he lived with PTSD. That led to an addiction to crack cocaine and, ultimately, trouble with the law.

In 2009, he was arrested for drug possession. After he jumped bail, afraid he would fail a drug test, he served time in prison and was told he would be deported. However, because he was a veteran, he was granted deferred action upon his release, which allowed him to remain in the US as long as he checked in with immigration officials annually.

For 14 years, he did just that while raising children and building a new life in Honolulu. In June, everything changed.

When Park went in for his regular appointment, he was told he had a removal order against him. After talking things over with his family and lawyer, he decided to self-deport because, he said, he worried he could not survive extended time in detention while fighting deportation.

“I could have ended up in ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’” Park said, referring to the Florida detention center that has come under fire for alleged inhumane conditions. “I was a legal resident. They allowed me to join, serve the country—front line, taking bullets for this country. That should mean something.”

Instead, he said, “This is how veterans are being treated.”

During his first term in office, Trump enacted immigration policies aimed at a group normally safe from scrutiny: noncitizens who serve in the US military. His administration sought to restrict typical avenues for immigrant service members to obtain citizenship and make it harder for green card holders to enlist—actions that ultimately were unsuccessful.

Now, as the second Trump administration engages in a campaign to detain and deport immigrants living in the US, military experts and veterans say service members are once again targets.

“President Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations, and he didn’t exempt military members, veterans and their families,” said retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a lawyer who helps veterans facing deportation. “It harms military recruiting, military readiness and the national security of our country.”

Under the Biden administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a policy stating a noncitizen’s prior military service was a “significant mitigating factor” that must be considered in enforcement decisions, including deportation orders. The policy also offered protection to noncitizen family members of veterans or those on active duty.

In April, under the Trump administration, that policy was rescinded and replaced with one saying that while “ICE values the contributions of all those who have served in the US military … military service alone does not automatically exempt” one from enforcement actions.

The new policy directs agents to ask about military service during intake interviews and to document service. However, local ICE leaders have the authority to proceed with deportations of those who have served, though they may consider factors such as community ties and employment history.

Both policies barred enforcement actions against active-duty service members, absent significant aggravating factors. Under the new policy, noncitizen relatives of service members are not addressed at all.

In the wake of all of this, some service members, like Park, are choosing to self-deport. In other instances, immigrant family members of soldiers or veterans have been detained; those include Narciso Barranco, a father of three US Marines who was arrested in Santa Ana, California, while working the landscaping job he had held for three decades.

“Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart,” Barranco’s son, veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in July to a US Senate subcommittee on border security. “I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies of this administration. I want them to know that the people being ripped from our communities are hardworking, honest, patriotic people who are raising America’s teachers, nurses and Marines.

“Deporting them doesn’t just hurt my family,” he added. “It hurts all of us.”

There is no publicly available data on how many veterans are being affected, though ICE is supposed to track removals of service members and veterans and the Department of Homeland Security is typically required to share that information with Congress.

A 2019 federal report found at least 250 veterans had been placed in removal proceedings between 2013 and 2018, with at least 92 ultimately deported. The report said that while ICE had policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans, it did not consistently identify and track actions against those individuals.

News21 could find only two DHS reports tracking removals of veterans. One, covering the first six months of 2022, said five veterans had been deported; another, for calendar year 2019, said three veterans had been deported.

In June, US Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, and nine other members of Congress wrote to the secretaries of defense, veterans affairs and homeland security seeking the number of veterans currently facing deportation—noting “some estimates” put the overall number of deported veterans at 10,000.

In a news release, Ansari said all veterans “deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not abandoned by an administration that turns their backs on their sacrifice.” Her office did not return messages from News21. DHS and ICE also did not respond to questions.

In past years, bills to do more to protect immigrant service members and their relatives have been introduced in Congress. One measure, introduced in May, would give green cards to parents of service members and allow those already deported to apply for a visa from abroad. It’s still in committee.

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and Army veteran, has proposed several measures related to immigrant service members, but those bills have gone nowhere. Last year, for example, she reintroduced a bill to allow deported veterans who have completed the preliminary naturalization process to attend citizenship interviews at a port of entry, embassy or consulate instead of having to obtain parole to come back into the US. It died in committee.

For Duckworth, deported veterans are not a partisan issue.

“This is about the men and women who wore the uniform of our great nation, many of whom were promised a chance at citizenship by our government in exchange for their service,” she told News21. “It’s about doing the right thing and keeping our nation’s promise.”

‘I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country’

As of February 2024, more than 40,000 foreign nationals were serving in active and reserve components of the Armed Forces, according to the Congressional Research Service. Another 115,000 were veterans living in the US.

Serving in the military has long been a pathway to citizenship, with provisions providing expedited naturalization for noncitizen service members dating back to the Civil War.

During World War I, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, foreign-born soldiers made up 18% of the Army. Some units even became known for their immigrant members; for example, the 77th Infantry Division was nicknamed the “Melting Pot Division.”

Since the end of World War I, more than 800,000 people have gained citizenship through military service, according to the CRS report. Since fiscal year 2020, service members from the

Philippines, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria and Ghana accounted for over 38% of service member naturalizations.

Generally, noncitizens who are permanent legal residents and who speak, read and write English fluently may join the armed forces. And during designated periods of hostility, noncitizens who serve honorably for any period of time—even one day—are eligible to apply for naturalization if they meet all criteria. The US is still considered to be in a period of hostility because of the post-9/11 war on terrorism.

Despite that longstanding policy, the Department of Defense, during Trump’s first term in office, tried to make it harder for service members to naturalize by forcing them to complete six months—rather than one day—before obtaining the “certification of honorable service” required to apply for citizenship. Naturalization applications subsequently plummeted by 72% from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued, and in 2020, a federal judge struck down the change.

Plaintiffs, including then-Army Pfc. Ange Samma, celebrated. Samma, originally from Burkina Faso, had lived in the US on a green card since he was a teenager. In 2018, he enlisted in the Army.

“I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country,” Samma told News21.

Over 14 months, even after he’d been assigned to Camp Humphreys in South Korea, Samma tried over and over to obtain certification of his honorable service—to no avail. He finally became naturalized not long after the 2020 court ruling.

This year, Samma earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He’s living in Statesboro, Georgia, while hunting for jobs. Because he now has citizenship, “There are many more opportunities that are open for me,” he said. “It’s very rewarding to have it. You feel proud.”

The Biden administration wound up rescinding the six-month policy, according to ACLU attorney Scarlet Kim. As of now, military members can once again apply for naturalization as soon as their service begins.

However, Kim notes, “If you don’t get your citizenship while you’re serving and then you’re discharged, what has happened is that you can potentially become vulnerable to deportation … despite having served our country in the military for however long.”

That’s exactly the situation facing Army veteran Marlon Parris.

Parris, who was born in Trinidad, has been in the US with a green card since the 1990s. He served in the Army for six years, including two tours in Iraq, and received the Army Commendation Medal three times, according to records filed in federal court.

Before his discharge in 2007, he was diagnosed with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, which was cited when Parris pleaded guilty in 2011 to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to federal prison.

Upon his release in 2016, he received a letter from the government stating he would not be deported, according to the group Black Deported Veterans of America. But on Jan. 22, just two days after Trump’s inauguration, agents detained Parris near his home in Laveen, outside of Phoenix. In May, a judge ruled that he was eligible for deportation.

His wife, Tanisha Hartwell-Parris, told News21 the couple plan to self-deport and bring along some of the seven children, ranging in age from 8 to 26, who are part of their blended family.

“I’m not going to put my husband in a situation to where he’s going to be a constant target, especially in the country that he fought for,” she said, adding that most people have no idea what immigrant service members face.

“People think that just because you’re a veteran … you should automatically have gotten status as a United States citizen,” she said. But the military, she added, “is different for immigrants. …. You’re fighting the same fight, but it’s not the same battle.”

A report published last year by the Veterans Law Practicum at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law noted the connections between PTSD, criminal behavior and the deportation of noncitizen veterans.

More than 20% of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder, the report found, which can result in more exposure to the criminal justice system.

That situation is “the most common scenario in terms of how deportation is triggered,” said Rose Carmen Goldberg, an expert in veterans law who oversaw completion of the report and now teaches in the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School.

The report also noted that even though deportation does not disqualify veterans from health care and other benefits earned through service, “Geographic and bureaucratic barriers may ultimately stand in the way.”

In 2021, the Biden administration launched the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative (IMMVI) to ensure deported veterans could access Veterans Affairs benefits. The program offered parole on a case-by-case basis to those needing to return to the US for legal counsel or to access care, and it sought to facilitate naturalization services for immigrant service members.

In the program’s first year, 143 veterans living outside of the US reached out to IMMVI staff, according to congressional testimony. A 2022 story by the nonprofit newsroom The War Horse said 102 veterans had been allowed back to the US via the IMMVI parole program, and “over 30” had obtained citizenship.

In response to questions about the status of the IMMVI program, USCIS directed News21 to its website about the program.

Jennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the Seattle Clemency Project, said the biggest flaw of the IMMVI program is that parole into the US is temporary – a “dead end” if a veteran doesn’t have a legal claim to restore legal residency or to naturalize.

“We had asked the Biden administration to do more to ensure that there was a further path towards restoring people’s lawful status beyond parole,” she said. “Basically, we didn’t succeed.”

A ‘lifeline’ for deported vets

In the absence of aid in the US, more and more veterans are turning to help elsewhere.

After serving in the Vietnam War with the Army, José Francisco Lopez, a native of Torreón, Mexico, experienced PTSD and struggled with addiction. He eventually went to prison for a drug-related crime and in 2003 was deported back to his home country.

For years, Lopez thought he was the only deported veteran in Mexico—until he met Hector Barajas, a deported Army veteran who in 2013 founded the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana.

Inspired, Lopez opened his own Deported Veterans Support House in Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso.

Today, Lopez, 80, is a legal resident of the US but splits his time between El Paso and Juárez, providing deported veterans housing, food and advice about how to apply for VA benefits. Since opening the support house in 2017, he’s helped about 20 people.

On a Saturday in June, four veterans stopped by to visit Lopez at the place they call “the bunker.” The gathering felt like a family reunion, with laughter filling the house as they shared memories of holidays spent together and other moments, both good and bad.

Said Ricardo Munoz, who came across Lopez and the bunker in 2019: “It’s kind of like being out in the ocean and someone throws a lifeline at you.”

US Air Force veteran Alfonso, who enlisted in 1976, said he was shocked when he was deported in 2001 after being charged with driving under the influence in El Paso. He said he mistakenly thought he had automatically earned citizenship for serving. Alfonso asked that his last name not be used because he is now trying to naturalize and fears publicity could hurt those efforts.

After living and working in Juarez for decades, Alfonso, with Lopez’s support, obtained parole back to the US in 2024 via the IMMVI program. He got his green card and now lives in El Paso, near his daughter.

For Alfonso, military service was a family affair. His brother served in Vietnam, his niece has done multiple tours in the Middle East, one nephew is in the Coast Guard and another is a Marine.

Citizenship or not, he said, “I was an American already, because I was willing to give my life for it.”

He added, “When you’re willing to give your life for something that, you don’t know, in one second you might be dead—it’s something. It’s important.”

‘It’s a whole new world’

Back in Seoul, Park, 56, is adjusting to life in a country he hadn’t even visited in 30 years. When he first arrived, he said, he cried every morning for hours.

“I just couldn’t stop,” he said. “It’s a whole new world. I speak the language, but I don’t read or write, so I’m trying to really relearn everything.”

For now, he’s staying with his father, but he worries about his family back in the US. His daughter works for the state of California. His son—also a military veteran—lives in Hawaii, where he works in cybersecurity and helps care for Park’s 85-year-old mother.

“I don’t know how many more years she’s got,” Park said. “My daughter, if she ever gets married, I won’t be there for a wedding.”

Park’s attorney started a petition to urge prosecutors to dismiss his criminal convictions, part of an attempt to cancel his deportation order and allow him to return to the United States. More than 10,000 people have signed.

Park said he’s grateful for the support but has little faith that the country he fought for will ever allow him to come back.

“I’m not blaming the military or VA – it’s literally the Trump administration,” he said. “What they’re doing is crazy.

“This is not the country that I volunteered and fought for,” he added. “This is just really wrong.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigrant_Troops_01.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:37.982446

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.
Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data.
Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.
Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.","Terry Gerton So Ms. Anand, let’s begin with you. As a refresher for the listeners, can you remind us of the legal and constitutional requirements that drive how we conduct our census?

Meeta Anand Yeah, absolutely. So the census is actually mentioned in Article One of the Constitution. It does not use the word census. It calls for an enumeration of all people, which is then used to apportion, or think of the word allocate, the number of seats that each state gets in the House of Representatives. It is further mentioned in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which mandates that every person living in the United States is counted for the purposes of apportionment. Additionally, we have Title 13, which is the portion of the United State’s code which delineates exactly how a census is to be conducted. And as we all know, it happens once every 10 years in the year ending in zero.

Terry Gerton So how did those guardrails shape what’s possible when you think about redesigning the census if you wanted to?

Meeta Anand So, one thing we know is that the 14th Amendment tells us that it’s a count of every person. It doesn’t say every citizen. It doesn’t say every voter. So right there, that’s one guardrail, which is that it uses the term person and not the term citizen or some other term. The other thing we know is that it has to happen every 10 years. And the first one occurred in the year 1790, per the Constitution. So we know that that happens every decade in the year ending in zero. What we also know is that it calls for an actual enumeration of people. So historically that has been interpreted as not a statistical sampling or a administrative records effort, but rather requires this effort of going out and doing a count of each person, which is why you have that familiar trope of census door knockers, where you have people going out and attempting to do that count of each and every person.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. So Mr. Fienberg, let me turn to you. President Trump has issued a directive that calls for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants and uses data from the 2024 election. What would that shift mean for the integrity and the independence of federal data collection?

Howard Fienberg So there are some complications there. So from the perspective of the Insights Association, where I also hold my hat in addition to the Census Project, we responded right away very excited about the prospect that the President would be interested in investing more resources into the census, because it’s a massive obligation of federal resources that takes an entire decade to put together in preparation and development. And so we looked at it from that angle. If you take it from a specific angle of holding a mid-decade census — which might be what he was suggesting, we don’t know that for certain — if that is the case, there are restrictions on doing a mid-decade census that present just a simple legal problem in that you can only do it in year five and we’re already running out of time in year five, certainly in the fiscal year, that’s almost over. But also just in the practical year, and putting together and conducting a census, as I said, takes a whole decade. That would be an extremely complicated thing to put together on very short notice, no matter how you’re going to do the count exactly, whether or not it has anything to do with questions of citizenship and immigration status, it doesn’t really matter. It would still be a Herculean task. And on top of that, there is a legal impediment already existing that such a mid-decade census, if you ran it, could only be used for purposes of, say, the divvying up of federal funds, of which trillions of dollars every year are guided by census data. So yeah, that would make sense. You want to get more accurate data for that purpose. That’s cool, but the law says that you can’t use it for purposes of apportionment and redistricting. So based on what presumably he would be looking to do with the data, he would not be able to do that under the course of the law.

Terry Gerton Got it. So, Ms. Anand, let me come back to you. From a practical standpoint, if we did a new census, we probably couldn’t get the mid-year done in 2025, as Mr. Fienberg has just said, but it takes a long time to prepare to do each census. You have the rules, you align everything. If we change the rules in 2025 for the 2030 census and don’t count undocumented immigrants, what does that mean for the actual process, and then what does it actually mean in communities that are already hard to count?

Meeta Anand Thank you for that question. Firstly, any change that historically, any change the Census Bureau makes, it has to do research on the impact of that change on the overall accuracy of the census. The Census Bureau itself says its mandate is to count every person once and only once and in the right place. So you have to see how changes impact that mandate. So if you start doing changes such as looking to exclude people from the count, you would need to add in questions, whether it be a citizenship question or an immigration status question. And that could have the chilling effect. And in fact, we have research that shows that this then has a chilling effect on immigrant communities, regardless of their status, undocumented, long-term permanent resident, children of immigrants. So right there, you start seeing this pressure on response rates that they start to decline with the addition of such questions. To your other point, any change has flow-through effects. So once you add a question, you also have to consider you’re changing the length of the form, you’re changing how the form is designed. And a lot of those things often get researched as well. So there are many steps involved in this. And as you said, and as Howard said, planning takes a long time, the planning for the 2030 census started in 2019. So to the elite person, 2025 may seem like a lot of time, but in 2026, the Census Bureau is extensively conducting field tests. And we also have to prepare for those tests now, which allow for the implementation of new technologies in 2030. So there is a deliberately deliberate process to get everything in place in time.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Meeta Anand. She’s Senior Director, Census and Data Equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Howard Fienberg, who’s the co-director of the Census Project and Senior VP for Advocacy at the Insights Association. So Mr. Fienberg, let me come back to you. Assuming that it was possible to change the questions for the 2030 census, what are the risks of discontinuity in the data at this point? If you have not had a question in all along and now you have a new question about citizenship or immigration status, what does that imply or what impact might that have on long-term data trends and compatibility?

Howard Fienberg There will be issues, and such things can be worked out methodologically and on the back end. It certainly changes up depending on the accuracy of what you’re collecting in the census itself. I think Meeta touched on that quite directly, and I think that’s where you would be most concerned in terms of the comparability of the output from the census. We don’t have a specific position one way or another on asking about citizenship or immigration status at the Census Project or at the Insights Association. But there are obviously, like you’ve pointed out, there are some concerns about what you’re going to get in terms of usefulness of data across time. And being able to make those comparisons, yes, very important. And certainly if you’re going to go talk to a statistician, they’re going to be very focused on that issue specifically. I think there were a couple of things I wanted to circle back, if we could, on when we were talking about setting up the new census. It’s not just where we are in the planning stages. And the interesting thing that the President raised in his Truth Social post was the concept that there were ways to improve the census overall with new kinds of data, new kinds of collection, while not knowing what it is exactly that he would have in mind. That is an exciting prospect that the administration would want to be involved in improving the overall count. And yeah, it’s certainly something to be encouraged. And yes, we are already at a stage where we’re rolling out field tests in 2026. This is kind of the last stop where you can do any kind of innovation because once you hit into the 2026 census test, you’re already ramping up really fast from there. So this would be a great time for the administration to engage with the Census Bureau, with the Commerce Department overall, and with stakeholders to talk about what would be involved in improving the census. What kind of things would they like to see and improve? Because now is really the last chance to get in something really meaty.

Terry Gerton And do you see any evidence of that collaboration door swinging open at this point?

Howard Fienberg Not yet, but that might need to wait for at least the nomination of a new director of the Census Bureau, because we have an acting director in Ron Jarmin, but I assume that they would be most comfortable with their own nominee. That hasn’t happened yet, but hopefully that’s something that will happen soon.

Terry Gerton Ms. Anand, I want to come back to you. You mentioned at the very beginning, counting every person, much depends on that census count. Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data. Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.

Meeta Anand Sure, absolutely. And I do want to say, while Howard stated the position of his organizations, I do want to say the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is opposed to the addition of a citizenship or immigration status question, on the basis that it would lead to an undercount of many of our communities that we want to ensure are accurately represented in the data. And that goes to your question directly. Why do we care that people are appropriately represented in data? Well, firstly is representation, as we went through, the number of seats you get in the House, but so many states and localities use the same data to draw district lines within their communities. Then you have the notion of $2.8 trillion of federal funds going to states every year for federally guided programs. So we’re looking at programs like SNAP, we’re looking at Medicaid, we’re looking at Medicare. We’re looking at hospitals. We’re looking at schools. I could go on forever. We’re looking at roads and public transportation decisions. So understanding how many people are in a community and who they are is really important to making these types of decisions about the programs and services they can get. And I would argue there’s a third point, which is less policy and more personal, which is data are the story we tell about our communities and about our country. So in order to truly understand who we are as a country and to tell the story of ourselves, we need to have that accurate and complete representation of who is on the ground.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. People, regardless of their immigration status, draw services, I guess is where you wind up. Mr. Feinberg, let’s wrap it up with you. How do you see this proposal playing out? And what should folks be watching for as the conversation unfolds?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Census_Bureau_DOGE_26971-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:39.033443

“We are in full compliance with the Attorney General’s opinion,” Stevens said.
“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time.
The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996.","TIFFIN — A legal and political dispute over immigration detention in Seneca County is intensifying following a recent opinion from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and a letter from the ACLU Ohio demanding the release of detainees held under sheriff-executed contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU argues that county sheriffs lack the legal authority to enter immigration detention agreements and that individuals held under such contracts may be unlawfully detained. In a letter sent to multiple counties, including Seneca, Geauga, Butler, Lake and Portage, the organization demanded the immediate release of detainees and a halt to local enforcement actions tied to ICE.

“To the extent that any individual was arrested, is currently being held, or was at one time held without lawful authority, they may have grounds to bring a lawsuit,” the ACLU said in a statement to The Advertiser-Tribune. The organization also criticized the lack of transparency, noting that several sheriff’s offices have refused to release ICE contracts, prompting lawsuits in the Ohio Supreme Court.

The legal debate was sparked by Yost’s formal opinion issued Aug. 26, which concluded that only county commissioners, not sheriffs, have the authority to contract with ICE for detention services. The opinion was requested by Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser after a sheriff there signed a new ICE agreement earlier this year.

Seneca County Sheriff Fred Stevens responded by stating that the county’s ICE contract was originally signed by the Board of Commissioners in 1996 and amended in 2003 to remain in effect indefinitely. Stevens said the jail currently houses 60 ICE detainees and emphasized that the contract is valid under Ohio law.

“We are in full compliance with the Attorney General’s opinion,” Stevens said. “Under no circumstance would any detainees be released into our county. ICE would come and pick them up if we ever ended the contract or if they did.”

Stevens declined to release a copy of the contract, citing federal regulations and the Federal Records Act. He directed inquiries to the federal Freedom of Information Act process, the same route he recommended to the ACLU earlier this year.

In June, The Advertiser-Tribune reported that the sheriff’s office had expanded its federal partnership by joining two additional ICE programs under the 287(g) initiative. These programs, the Task Force model and the Warrant Service Officer model, authorize trained deputies and jail staff to arrest individuals with immigration detainers and serve administrative warrants.

“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time. “I see this as just another step of partnering with the federal government to assist with the law.”

The sheriff emphasized that deputies would not actively seek out unauthorized immigrants but would use the training when encountering individuals with detainers during routine calls or traffic stops. He also cited liability protection as a key reason for joining the programs.

The Seneca County Board of Commissioners issued a brief statement via County Administrator Barb Patterson acknowledging Yost’s opinion and said it had asked the sheriff and county prosecutor to review the matter and advise on any necessary changes. The board did not comment on the validity of the current contract or whether it plans to take further action.

The ACLU maintains that without access to the contracts, the public cannot determine whether agreements are valid, who executed them or what they authorize. The organization has filed a public records lawsuit against the sheriff’s office in the Ohio Supreme Court, which is currently in mediation. The most recent action in the case was the court’s referral to its mediation program on Aug. 20. All filing deadlines are currently stayed while both parties attempt to resolve the dispute outside of formal proceedings.

While Yost’s opinion did not direct counties to release detainees, it clarified that only commissioner-approved contracts are valid and that detainees may be held beyond the typical 48-hour limit if such agreements are in place. The ACLU interprets the opinion as reinforcing its position that sheriff-executed contracts are unlawful.

“The collaboration between federal and local law enforcement and exactly what they are doing and if it is lawful is of great public interest,” said Sheila Smith, senior public relations strategist for ACLU Ohio. “The fact that these agencies are going to great lengths to keep these documents hidden should be a matter of great concern to everyone.”

Sheriff Stevens said no changes are expected to transportation or detention procedures, and the jail will continue operating under its current arrangement.

“County jails, particularly ours, should be partnering with the federal government to assist with any housing needs,” Stevens said. “We have a quarter century of partnering with the federal government.”

The Ohio Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment by The Advertiser-Tribune’s publication deadline.

The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996. ICE has indicated a goal of responding within 20 business days, though the agency noted that processing may take longer due to the high volume of requests it is currently receiving.",http://d3i5p6znmm9yua.cloudfront.net/360_FindlayCourier_Live/0/0/0/0/744/49/744049_1,N,,2025-09-12 17:57:57.900023

Gavin Newsom’s legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles.

“In Denver, our residents are connected with police who live on the same streets they patrol and with officers who grew up in the same communities they’re sworn to protect. That’s why our crime rates are plummeting,” Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement. “What the Trump Administration is doing in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. isn’t a strategy for fighting crime. It’s a federal police state meant to sow chaos, cause disruption, and strip rights away from local governments and citizens.”

An amicus brief is a legal document that allows a party to provide an outside perspective on an issue under litigation.

In the brief filed on Tuesday, Denver argues that the deployment of military troops for policing purposes “dramatically increases the risk of irreparable injury to constitutional sovereignty promised by the 10th Amendment, the fundamental constitutional rights of residents, and the general welfare of the public.”

The city also asserts to the court that local police departments are better suited to serve residents while protecting their rights under local, state and federal laws.

During an Aug. 27 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, Johnston called Trump’s “militarization” of the nation’s cities “unprecedented” and “dangerous.” He promised to take the administration to court “on Day One” should the White House send federal troops to Denver.

“Any first-year law student in America could tell you that deploying the U.S. military on the streets of American cities in times of peace to enforce domestic law is clearly illegal,” the mayor posted. “Denver does not need any help from the National Guard, as we are seeing the largest decrease in violent crime of any top 50 city in the country.”

After the Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers and Marines to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids, Newsom, a Democrat, sued, arguing the president’s actions violated federal law.

On Sept. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer ruled in a 52-page opinion that Trump’s decision to deploy troops in Los Angeles was illegal.

The federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard troops in California does not automatically apply to other states.

Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump’s directive based on high crime rates in Democrat-led cities. FBI data show that 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates and at least 100,000 residents in 2024 had Democratic mayors.

The National Police Association earlier said it welcomes more “boots on the ground,” referring to Trump’s executive order creating a series of specialized military units within the National Guard that, under the direction of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, would be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public disorder issues.”

The Trump executive order is a positive step toward rectifying a decrease in “boots-on-the-ground law enforcement” over the past decade, National Police Association spokesperson Betsy Brantner Smith told technology publication Smart Cities Dive.

“The order declares that safe communities depend on a tough and well-equipped police force,” she told the publication. “That’s something that the president has said with some frequency — let cops be cops.”

Denver recently filed a motion to dismiss the Trump administration’s lawsuit against the city and state, claiming it was an unlawful attempt to overturn local policy on immigration. The city has also filed four lawsuits against the administration.

This summer, the city was granted a preliminary injunction preventing Trump’s threats to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in allocated transportation funding.

The city also joined Chicago and Pima County, Arizona, in seeking to recover $24 million in FEMA dollars allocated for the purposes of sheltering and assisting migrants.

That case is still pending.

The city has also received a favorable ruling in two other cases where the administration has threatened to withhold federal dollars – one over so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” and the other over funding to prevent large-scale security threats.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/johnston-profile.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:58:01.856986

More than 300 South Korean workers at an electric vehicle battery factory in Georgia are headed home to South Korea today, a week after being swept up in a massive raid by federal agents. They were among nearly 500 workers detained and accused of working illegally. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul that the incident shocked South Koreans and could have damaged one of the U.S.' most important economic relationships.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, released a video of their raid last week on the battery factory in Bryan County, Georgia, run by South Korean firms Hyundai and LG.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)

KUHN: The most jarring images were of Korean workers being handcuffed and chained at the waist and ankles. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told a press conference that if such problems can't be resolved, it could impact South Korean investment in the U.S.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT LEE JAE MYUNG: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""Korean companies will inevitably have to consider,"" he said, ""whether it's worth establishing local factories in the U.S. if it means facing all sorts of disadvantages or difficulties in future."" South Korea has recently emerged as one of the biggest foreign investors in the U.S. Ahead of a summit with President Trump last month, President Lee pledged to invest $350 billion in exchange for lower tariffs on South Korean exports. At that summit, Trump praised South Korea's role in helping to rebuild American manufacturing, but he later defended the raid on the Hyundai plant.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job.

KUHN: President Lee says the U.S. wanted to transport the workers to the Atlanta airport in handcuffs, but South Korean officials flatly refused, and the U.S. side eventually backed down. In South Korea's parliament this week, lawmaker Yoon Hu-duk deplored the raid on the factory.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

YOON HU-DUK: (Through interpreter) In negotiations, the U.S. has encouraged us to invest, and then they stabbed us in the back, to be frank.

KUHN: Hur Jung is an economist at Sogang University in Seoul. He says the Hyundai factory in Georgia was still testing its production lines.

HUR JUNG: (Through interpreter) To make this stage progress efficiently, Korean workers and technicians familiar with the system do test runs and get the line rolling. The factory will eventually hire and transition to a local workforce.

KUHN: Hur explains that the U.S. does not have visa quotas for skilled South Korean workers, so the Hyundai technicians came to the U.S. on short-term visas and got caught in ICE's crackdown. Jang Sang-sik is head of the International Trade Research Institute at the Korea International Trade Association, a private trade lobby group. He sees the raid as a quirk.

JANG SANG-SIK: (Through interpreter) We see this as an unusual clash between U.S. state and federal governments, which are hungry for foreign investment, and the immigration agencies and American public, who view illegal employment or immigration very negatively.

KUHN: Jang adds that South Korea is tamping down its anger at the raid because it needs a lot from the U.S., not just lower tariffs but also help countering threats from North Korea and China. He adds that if the issues raised by the factory raid are properly resolved, it could even boost South Korean investments in the U.S.

The agency now projects 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029. Economists warned less immigration and negative net migration could create woes for the U.S. labor force and inflation.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is resulting in the U.S. population growth shrinking faster than anticipated, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—a phenomenon economists have warned will lead to a labor shortage, drive up inflation, and, under some circumstances, shrink U.S. GDP growth.

The nonpartisan budgetary agency published a revised demographic outlook on Wednesday, projecting death will exceed births in the U.S. beginning in 2031, two years earlier than it previously projected, as a result of a diminished immigrant population as well as lower fertility rates.

The CBO attributed the revisions in large part to Trump’s 2025 reconciliation act, or “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which provides a total of $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement, including a lump sum of $29.9 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and the hiring of 10,000 ICE officers.

About 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029 as a result of the law, the CBO said, and about 50,000 immigrants will be detained per day in the same period. An increase in ICE personnel will lead to 5,500 more arrests in 2026 and 100,000 more in 2029 than if the policy had not been enacted. Another 30,000 are projected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

This crackdown will have a direct effect on labor, according to the agency.

“CBO estimates that the additional detentions resulting from the law will have two effects,” the report said. “First, people who are detained will not be available to work and will therefore not be in the labor force. Second, detention increases the likelihood that immigrants who receive an order of removal will be successfully removed.”

The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The economics impact of an immigration crackdown

Trump’s anti-immigration efforts have led economists to sound the alarms about the policy’s impact on the U.S. workforce and subsequent economic health.

While the CBO still expects a positive net migration for 2025, economists have also warned that a negative net migration—which Trump has actively worked for as a result of his policies—could hinder U.S. GDP growth.

A working paper published in July from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative economics policy center, found negative net migration could lead to a loss in consumer spending and a diminishing labor force that could shrink U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% and 0.4%, or roughly between $70.5 billion to $94 billion in annual lost economic output.

“Our workforce is disproportionately made up of immigrants relative to their share of the population, and because of that we…really can’t sustain a high level of job growth with the U.S.-born population alone, because there just aren’t enough bodies, essentially, to do that,” report co-author Tara Watson, a Brookings Institute economist and professor of economics at Williams College, previously told Fortune.

Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said last month the labor force shrinkage, as a result of a narrowing immigration population, could even have inflationary effects, predicting inflation could rise from 2.5% to around 4% early next year if deportations continue at their current rate.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported last month that the producer price index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% from June to July, up 3.3% compared to the period a year ago. The core consumer price index increased 0.2% from June to July. Inflation continued to rise in August as new job numbers slumped.

“Foreign-born labor force is declining, and the overall labor force has gone flat since the beginning of the year,” Zandi told Fortune last month. “That’s causing tightening in a lot of markets, adding to costs and inflation.”

“You can see it in meat prices, agriculture, food processing, haircuts, dry cleaning,” he added. “The fingerprints of the restrictive immigration policy are all over the CPI and PPI numbers we got this week.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eOjihlhJ3TBzpoRnIWZgng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/a58f144cf071a8c0302282871fcb324b,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:42.559756

Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest more than 3,000 undocumented immigrants across the state this year, according to public records obtained by The Texas Tribune that provide the most detailed glimpse yet of how state police are shifting their focus from the border toward aiding the Trump administration’s mass deportation crusade — an effort that state officials have kept largely under wraps.

From late January through early September, DPS recorded 3,131 previously unreported arrests connected to specialty teams created at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott to help President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency’s records show. Roughly 88% of the people arrested were picked up on suspicion of violating federal immigration laws like improper entry into the country, marking what may be an unprecedented use of state resources for a role once performed exclusively by federal authorities.

“Operation Lone Star 2.0 is underway statewide — with DPS personnel working to combat and interdict criminal activity with a nexus to the border,” DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said in an email, referring to Texas’ border initiative under the Biden administration for which thousands of troopers were dispatched to the border.

Amid a sharp fall in illegal border crossings, DPS has moved some of its troopers and investigators onto “strike teams” that work with federal agencies across Texas — including in each of the largest metro areas — to arrest people “who have entered the United States illegally and then gone on to commit crimes in the state,” according to the agency.

The federal government has sole authority to enforce immigration violations under federal law. State and local police can’t arrest someone simply for being undocumented without agreements that extend them limited power to do so. As of late July, DPS had no such agreements in place with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency under DHS’ umbrella that oversees much of the nation’s immigration policing, according to DPS records and an ICE database of active partnerships.

Nolen said DPS officers have jurisdiction across Texas to “protect and serve every corner” of the state, though she noted that officers “must have probable cause” to apprehend someone.

The agency has otherwise remained tight-lipped about its deportation efforts, having yet to offer details about how the strike teams function, how they decide who to target or where the people who have been arrested are located now.

Nolen declined to directly respond to a list of questions about the operations, citing the agency’s policy of not disclosing “operational specifics.”

Department officials do not know the whereabouts of those arrested by DPS’ strike teams because they do not keep track of them once they leave the agency’s custody, Nolen said, also deferring to federal authorities for details about their criminal histories.

The Trump administration has said it would prioritize deporting violent criminals, and DPS’ leader has said state authorities working with the feds share the focus. As of mid-August, DPS had identified nearly 6,500 “criminal illegal immigrants with active felony warrants in Texas for a variety of offenses,” Nolen said, including murder, drug and sex crimes, and human smuggling. Officers from all DPS divisions arrested roughly 30,000 people from the start of the year through July.

“Right now, we're going after the migrants that pose the largest threat to the communities,” DPS Director Freeman Martin told the Public Safety Commission, which he answers to, in February. “And there's a lot of them.”

Reports for seven of the arrests, also obtained through a public information request, suggest DPS officers are using a broad range of tactics to apprehend people and, at least for this limited sample size, targeting those with a mix of serious and nonexistent criminal history.

Among them was a Honduran man in Austin who was riding in the passenger seat of a car stopped for an expired registration after DPS apparently staked out his home. An ICE agent with DPS at the scene detained the man upon confirming he had overstayed a visa. Court records show he had been accused of domestic violence in 2022, but the case was later dropped.

In another case, a man was arrested at a Dallas home, where officers arrived after tracking GPS data, according to an arrest report that provided no further details about the tracking. The man had no previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

Two others were arrested in a targeted probe with the feds that led authorities to $16,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine and meth. Both had faced drug charges in the past, Harris County court records show.

Many of the immigration arrests occurred hundreds of miles from the border. Nearly 700 — at least one in five — took place in either Austin, Dallas or Houston, where left-leaning local officials have historically resisted cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Those figures are almost certainly an undercount because the DPS records did not say where more than 1,000 of the arrests took place.

The focus on crackdowns far away from the border “raises red flags,” said Osvaldo Grimaldo, a policy and advocacy strategist with the ACLU of Texas, which has accused DPS of using racial profiling and focusing on migrants accused of low-level offenses in its recent border policing.

“As DPS is expanding these efforts into parts of the interior of the state, what are the intentions?” Grimaldo asked. “Are they being lawful? Are they collaborating with other agencies at the municipal level?”

Operation Lone Star without the fanfare

The regional tactical strike teams mark the latest plunge into immigration enforcement for Texas’ main public safety agency, whose troopers have long been known for dishing out speeding tickets and warnings for busted tail lights. The sprawling agency also issues driver’s licenses, among other regulatory duties, and often takes the lead on major criminal probes, including the bungled response to the deadly Uvalde school shooting in 2022.

DPS had already ramped up its presence at the Texas-Mexico border over the last decade. Abbott escalated things to new levels four years ago, when he ordered thousands of troopers to be dispatched to the state’s 1,254-mile southern border as part of his Operation Lone Star program to deter border crossings.

At the time, DPS was not making federal immigration arrests. Instead, officers arrested thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants for trespassing on private property, a state offense, as the number of illegal border crossings hit record highs.

Those novel misdemeanor arrests carried a maximum penalty of one year in jail, and became a source of controversy as Texas escalated its immigration enforcement unlike any state had ever done, drawing questions about whether migrants were being denied due process and other constitutional rights.

The number of illegal crossings began tanking last summer and has continued to plunge under the Trump administration. Still, the Legislature earmarked another $3.4 billion for border security earlier this year, giving about one-third of it to DPS with an eye toward immigration enforcement in the state’s interior.

Eight days after Trump took office for his second term, Abbott directed DPS to deploy strike teams that could help the Trump administration “locate and arrest criminal illegal immigrants in the state.”

“After four years of failed policies, Texas finally has a partner in President Trump,” Abbott said. “Together, we will end this crisis and make America safe once again.”

Since then, DPS has issued statements acknowledging individual arrests conducted by the teams but said nothing about their overall productivity — a stark contrast to the highly publicized accomplishments touted under Operation Lone Star.

The governor and agency frequently shared updates on arrests and drug seizures stemming from the border program. They posted photos and videos of migrants being arrested, held press conferences in cities along the border to unveil new initiatives, and along the way drew the Biden administration into a constitutional fight over how much authority a state has to enforce immigration laws.

In comparison, little information is being released or celebrated about the strike teams.

That includes one team’s major raid of a party in Hays County earlier this year, initially detailed by DPS as a bust of alleged gang members and their associates carried out with various federal agencies. Authorities arrested almost four dozen people during the raid, children among them.

But party guests have denied having gang affiliations and said they had rented a big house with a swimming pool to celebrate a pair of birthdays — including that of a kid who instead turned 5 in ICE detention, the Tribune previously reported.

All 35 detainees identified by the Tribune were arrested on suspicion of illegally entering the country. None had previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

An uncertain scope

Such state apprehensions are only part of the deportation efforts underway across multiple layers of government. The tally of immigrants arrested by DPS’ strike teams doesn’t account for those picked up after being stopped by local law enforcement or instances where federal immigration authorities are working on their own.

There are also signs that the scope and scale of DPS' deportation operations extend beyond the more than 3,100 strike team arrests. The DPS spokesperson noted that the agency aided a massive ICE operation last month that led the feds to arrest more than 800 suspected undocumented immigrants; it was not clear if such efforts are counted toward DPS' strike team arrest tally. Additionally, records obtained by the Tribune show that at least one of the detainees was deported along with family members who were not counted among the apprehensions.

That arrest began when a state trooper followed Omar Gallardo Rodriguez’s white truck for about two minutes before pulling him over next to Dobie Middle School in North Austin over a traffic infraction. His wife, Denisse Parra Vargas, was in the passenger seat, according to video recorded by the DPS trooper’s dash camera. The footage showed that, within an hour of being pulled over, Rodriguez was whisked away by a masked officer accompanying five DPS troopers to the scene.

Within a week, federal agents also deported Parra Vargas — who had entered the country illegally seeking protection from a previous abusive partner, advocates say — and their kids, two of whom were born in the United States.

DHS officials have labeled Rodriguez a “serial lawbreaker” in past statements for previous accusations of assaulting a family member, driving under the influence and entering the country illegally four times.

The family’s lawyers declined to comment and Rodriguez did not respond to an email.

Arrests like Rodriguez’s could become more frequent as DPS and its federal partners gain reinforcements next year under a new Texas law that will require most sheriffs in the state to enter agreements with ICE. Roughly 11% of all Texas sheriffs have already inked agreements with the federal agency — according to ICE records from early September — for a controversial program that extends deputies the authority to ask people about their legal status during their routine patrols.

Approximately 2.1 million undocumented immigrants call Texas home, second in the nation only to California. The Trump administration has not regularly published data about its deportation efforts, but recent independent research suggests that for the first time in decades, more immigrants have left the U.S. than arrived so far this year.

Outside of Houston, members with FIEL — an acronym that translates to Immigrant Families and Students in the Fight — have recorded accounts of DPS troopers waiting to stop people for traffic violations off Highway 59 near a massive subdivision north of the city that has been a lightning rod among Republican officials because its developer sells land to undocumented people.

“It’s happening every day,” said Alain Cisneros, a FIEL organizer who knocked doors in the neighborhoods to conduct a survey that found many of the residents are living in great fear.

He said it appeared like a replica of Operation Lone Star — but 400 miles from the Mexican border.

Doll joined faith leaders and other community advocates decrying the detention Aug. 25 at the Ohio Statehouse.
Soliman and his fate have become a rod among faith groups and activists in Ohio amid Trump's mass deportation effort.
Ayman Soliman, a former chaplain at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, was detained by ICE agents July 9.
""That's why we're here today in support of Imam Soliman.","When U.S. immigration authorities detained Imam Ayman Soliman at a routine check-in July 9, the outcry was swift. Known as the ""interfaith imam"" for his work at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and a local mosque, Soliman's case has inspired hundreds to protest, pray and plead for his release.

""We are just a country that is breaking promises,"" said Dominican Sr. of Peace Gemma Doll of Columbus, Ohio.

Doll joined faith leaders and other community advocates decrying the detention Aug. 25 at the Ohio Statehouse. The group — which included The Undivided, a racial justice group; Center for American Islamic Relations-Ohio; Young United Souls for Revolutionary Action, a Muslim-led group; Ohio Immigrant Alliance — delivered a letter signed by 1,166 people to Ohio Governor Mike DeWine urging him to intervene in Soliman's case.

""Governor DeWine, you have the ability, the opportunity to make Ohio shine as a righteous state, a moral state, not one that gives way to immoral and unfair treatment of a person,"" Doll said in a press release from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Soliman and his fate have become a rod among faith groups and activists in Ohio amid Trump's mass deportation effort. Faith leaders said that for those who believe in human dignity, Soliman's case has become a test not just of one man's fate, but of the values his supporters say America — and people of faith — are called to defend.

""I think our whole sense of human dignity and the individual rights, human rights, enter into this,"" said Franciscan Fr. Al Hirt, pastor of St. Francis Seraph Catholic Church in Cincinnati. ""It seems wrong. The bishops have been pretty good about support for immigration reform and doing it justly but it would sure be nice to see a little bit more Catholic voice supporting a person like this.""

Hirt signed an interfaith clergy letter backing Soliman. The Franciscan priest said it is important for Catholics to speak up in the face of all injustice, but particularly cases like Soliman's.

""I just could not find any reason why this imam lost his asylum status,"" said Hirt, who has worked in parishes in Cincinnati for 35 years. ""It just doesn't make sense. It's just another good person being rounded up, detained, not a criminal. He's not done anything wrong.""

Soliman, 51, came to the United States in 2014, fleeing Egypt after he was jailed and beaten for his journalism during the Arab Spring, pro-democracy and anti-government protests that started in 2011.

Soliman won asylum in the U.S. in 2018 under the first Trump administration. In the final month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke it. Officials cited Soliman's past work with an Egyptian charity with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, though neither Egypt nor the U.S. lists the group as a terrorist organization. Court records show after Trump returned to office officials formalized the terrorism charges and his asylum was revoked on June 3.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Soliman at a routine check-in in July. He is challenging the change in his asylum status in court and has won a legal battle to remain in the Butler County Jail near Cincinnati, Ohio, while his case progresses.

Soliman's most recent hearing took place Sept. 3 in Cleveland Immigration Court. An immigration court hearing Sept. 25 will address the merits of his asylum claim.

Doll cited her faith in calling for help for Soliman.

""Our Catholic faith that unites us, Governor DeWine, stands firmly that every human person has the right to life, has a right to dignity,"" Doll said. ""That is not what Ayman is getting. He is being dismally treated and it's wrong. It's morally wrong, and you know it. So please, in the name of God, stand up for this human life.""

Rev. Joel Miller of the Columbus Mennonite Church invoked Scripture stories that call for fair treatment of immigrants, and Jesus' admonition to love our neighbor as ourselves.

""Our faith absolutely compels us to remember who we are and to act accordingly,"" Miller said. ""That's why we're here today in support of Imam Soliman. He is both the good Samaritan and the foreigner, who as a chaplain has tended to the needs of the hurt and even the dying, the very model of a neighbor.""

Bilal Ahmed, an attorney with the Center for American Islamic Relations in Ohio who has worked on Soliman's case, noted that earning asylum status is no easy feat.

""Getting asylum is a yearslong process. There's a number of different hoops you have to go through,” Ahmed said. “You're vetted at every single level. He had passed the asylum threshold and was on the verge of getting his green card, but it was stalled for a number of years … It is concerning to say the least.""

Ahmed said the support Soliman has received from the local community has been heartening.

""I went down to Cincinnati on the day that he was unfortunately detained and just everyone was coming out of nowhere,"" Ahmed said. ""All these people were showing up in support … Since then, there's been a whole coalition in Ohio trying to get him released.

""I was shocked that all these people knew Imam Ayman,"" Ahmed added. ""That's a testament to his interfaith work in the community. He's just going out and helping people regardless of their religious backgrounds.""

Among the many speaking out for Soliman was Rev. Adam Allen, a former Cincinnati Children's Hospital chaplain who said he lost his job after participating in a July 17 prayer vigil for Soliman. He worked side by side with Soliman, visiting children and families experiencing difficult times.

""I proudly worked to be the best chaplain that I can be, but Ayman is on a whole other level that I can only aspire to be,"" Allen said.

During his first week at the hospital, Allen shadowed Soliman.

""He moved fast,"" Allen said. ""He was hard to keep up with. We'd meet with one family, he'd calmly assess their spiritual needs, learn what they were going through, pray with them, and bring them hope. He would move so fast.""

Allen noted Soliman has a pacifying impact on patients. ""Once he had entered the room, all this calm and peace would come with him,"" Allen said. ""Then we'd move on immediately to the next patient. It felt like we were running.""

Soliman speaks Arabic, Spanish and English.

""When an Arabic-speaking family was approaching a difficult prognosis, he would leave the team a note saying, call me anytime, no matter what hour, and I will come in to support this family and he meant it,"" Allen said. ""I would have to tell new people. He really means it. That's what he wants. He'll be upset if you don't call him.""

Outside the hospital Soliman led a biweekly halaqah, or study circle, for Muslim students at the University of Cincinnati, taught the Quran to young Muslims and worked to make sure other volunteers at his mosque were recognized for their contributions.

Soliman also served on Cincinnati Children's ethics committee. Soliman holds master's degrees in Islamic studies and Muslim chaplaincy and is a doctoral candidate in the same field. His focus is on interfaith, islamophobia and bioethics. Soliman has served as an imam for over two decades and is a member of the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America.

Tala Ali, a close friend who attended the same mosque and worked with Soliman in the Association of Muslim Chaplains, said she speaks to Soliman in jail every day. She said he has good and bad days but is encouraged by those telling his story.

""He said, 'I just want you to talk about me; to remember me.' Knowing he's not forgotten is what's keeping him alive and hanging on. He's got so many letters from people who have sent him Quran verses, Bible verses, sharing stories, sharing their prayers. … That has meant the world to him.""

Ali was there when Soliman was taken into custody and has been at the forefront of supporters telling his story ever since.

""I shouldn't have to sell a person for them to have their basic human dignities and rights recognized,"" she said. ""He fights so hard and cares so hard for everyone else's kids, and he has been through what he's gone through and he's so soft.”

As Soliman awaits his next hearing, his friends and supporters say they will continue to speak out, pray and rally for his release.

""He just gives and gives and gives,"" Ali said. ""He holds himself up to a standard that is so high without demanding those standards of others.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/9.12.25%20Ayman%20DeWine%20Press%20Conference.jpg?h=520a578a&itok=CNXYqsPH,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:43.278851

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants' imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump's aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services — a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents ""don't want to risk"" their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On Sept. 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration's appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration's approach is ""to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.""

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go ""home,"" Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said it is ""important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.""

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

""It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,"" the El Paso bishop said. ""We're happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.""

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the ""sensitive locations"" policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

""It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,"" she said. ""Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.""

Feasley said many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

""This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and people's ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

""Particularly in this time,"" she said, ""our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision-makers who would understand this.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:48.984234

Last week, protestors successfully turned an ICE vehicle away as it attempted to enter the facility. The facility became a focus of the efforts of immigration rights advocates ever since the town's mayor confirmed that the location was slated to be the main processing center for expanded ice operations in the Chicago area.

The facility is supposed to operate pretty much 24-hours a day for the next month and a half because of the start of operation Midway Blitz, which federal officials say targets undocumented people with criminal records.

Local immigration rights leaders say although they've not seen a mass surge in arrests by immigration agents, supporters do say there's been an increase in calls for legal help because of the immigration crackdown.

""Hotline call volume has been higher than at any point since January,"" Lawrence Benito, of Illinois Coalition of Immigrant & Refugee Rights. ""This indicates that ICE agents are present throughout the Chicagoland area and we need to remain vigilant with or without the National Guard present.""

The protest is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. and last until 7 p.m..

Faith leaders, Broadview community members and concerned residents are expected to be out protesting. They said they refuse to be intimidated by what they say is the trump administration's efforts to target and mistreat immigrant communities.

On Monday, they left the park and were on their way home when D.C. police pulled Funes over in Northwest D.C.

Neighbors, Lopez said, told another family member who got to the scene that they “witnessed my brother calmly asking questions as the officers were pulling him out of the car. My brother was trying to explain to them that my niece is autistic, and if he got out of the car, she was going to be crying in the car, and it was going to put her in a bad place.”

The stop came days before President Donald Trump’s crime emergency in D.C. was scheduled to end. Federal agents arrived on the scene, and Lopez said Funes was taken away.

“It’s been horrible,” Lopez said. “The only brother I have from mom and dad was taken like a criminal.”

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement records, Funes is in ICE custody and is currently at the Caroline Detention Facility in Caroline County, Virginia. Family members spoke to Funes Thursday morning, Lopez said, adding, “he gets mistreated verbally. It’s very cold. He says it almost feels like a freezer.”

Relatives are concerned, Lopez said, because Funes has asthma and needs medication “because he gets very anxious. And when he gets anxious, he triggers his asthma attacks.”

Now, they’re contacting various community groups and raising money to hire a lawyer, “so that we can potentially just get him out of there, where he is right now,” Lopez said.

Meanwhile, Lopez said Funes’ daughter hasn’t been able to sleep. She cries a lot, because she’s used to her dad telling her stories around bedtime, Lopez said.

“He is the main provider for his family, and I think he was just ripped apart from his family, and in a very unfair way,” Lopez said.

“He was trying to speak to the officers, telling them that he wanted to stay silent when they asked him for his status. He didn’t want to answer that question, because he felt discriminated. They didn’t stop him to ask him that, he thought they stopped him for something else.”

And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.
Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region.
But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.
Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.” The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”","For decades across Latin America and the Caribbean, U.S. drug enforcement officials have tried to cut off narcotics trafficking by intercepting boats, trucks and even horses laden with drugs and arresting the smugglers.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said those efforts are not bold enough. He has helped steer the Trump administration toward a much more aggressive — and deadly — tactic: use military force to destroy suspected drug boats and kill the people on board, without a legal process.

“Interdiction doesn’t work,” Mr. Rubio said at a news conference in Mexico City last week when asked about the U.S. attack on a boat in the Caribbean. President Trump had boasted that the strike had killed at least 11 people.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Mr. Rubio added. “And it’ll happen again. Maybe it’s happening right now, I don’t know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.”

Mr. Rubio has cast himself as a top general in that war.

No senior Trump official has spoken more forcefully about the new campaign of violence against Latin American criminal groups and their allies. And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.

Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region. The son of anti-Communist immigrants from pre-revolutionary Cuba, he was motivated by his loathing for the Castro government and its allies, notably Venezuela — a stance well rewarded by Florida’s sizable population of expatriates from those countries.

Now, as both secretary of state and White House national security adviser, he is seizing his chance to turn words into action.

Mr. Rubio has long sought the ouster of leftist strongmen in the region, particularly leaders of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, whose governments he has called “illegitimate.” He has also helped engineer the administration’s mass deportations of immigrants, including to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

And the push for military action and the ouster of national leaders could draw criticism from a vocal wing of Mr. Trump’s movement that advocates greater military restraint in foreign policy. Those conservatives criticize “forever wars” and “regime change,” and some already view Mr. Rubio with suspicion, pointing to a history of “neocon” positions.

However, there are those Trump supporters and aides who applaud Mr. Rubio’s approach. They see him as reasserting an updated version of the Monroe Doctrine, an early-19th-century concept that justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Mr. Rubio hopes to “define a real new paradigm in the Western Hemisphere,” said Juan Gonzalez, who served as the top National Security Council official for the region in the Biden White House.

Mr. Gonzalez said Mr. Rubio’s scathing rhetoric — he has branded Nicaragua’s government “an enemy of humanity” — was meant to establish a “predicate” for further military action in the hemisphere.

His top target for now appears to be Venezuela, whose criminal groups the Trump administration has linked to the country’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro.

Last month, Mr. Rubio ordered the State Department to increase a reward to $50 million for any information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction on U.S. drug charges.

During the first Trump administration, Mr. Rubio played a leading role in pushing the president to try to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Now, a recent U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean has prompted speculation over whether the administration will try to invade Venezuela and seize Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Rubio said last week that Mr. Maduro was a fugitive from American justice, after having been indicted by a grand jury in a New York federal court on drug trafficking charges in 2020.

“Nicolás Maduro is not a government or political regime,” he told reporters in Quito, Ecuador. “They are a terrorist organization and organized crime organization that have taken over a country so that they can become the leaders, so that they can become billionaires. And that is why they were indicted by the courts in the U.S.”

Mr. Maduro, who has pointed to Mr. Rubio as his main nemesis in Washington, issued his own warning on Sept. 1, before Mr. Trump announced the strike on the boat.

“Mr. President, Donald Trump, watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood,” he said.

‘Blow Them Up’

Mr. Rubio’s Senate record stands at odds with Mr. Trump’s approach to some key issues. So since joining the administration, Mr. Rubio has softened some of his hawkish views, at least in public, on issues such as Russia and the promotion of democracy.

But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.

“Rubio and Trump dovetail particularly well on Latin America,” said Mike Watson, the deputy director of the conservative Hudson Institute’s Center for Strategy and American Statecraft.

The two men share a drive to tackle what Mr. Watson called the region’s “chaos and disorder” in the form of narcotics and migrants.

“Under Secretary Rubio, the State Department is working to implement President Trump’s vision to make our region secure, stable and prosperous,” Tommy Pigott, the department’s deputy spokesperson, said when asked for comment for this article. “That means eliminating the cartels, ending illegal mass migration and pushing out China’s exploitative practices.”

When it comes to narcotics, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio cast the flow of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs into the United States as a matter of national security that justifies the use of deadly force.

During his visit to Ecuador, Mr. Rubio said the Trump administration was ready to help partner governments “blow up” criminal groups.

“There’s long been a bipartisan consensus around treating cartels as a law enforcement matter rather than a military matter,” Mr. Watson said. “Trump and Rubio are no longer treating this issue that way. They are happy to use the military.”

And while past U.S. presidents have discussed migration from Central and Latin America mostly in social and economic terms, Mr. Rubio has embraced the notion that the flow of people also “poses a national security threat.”

Citing his own parents, Mr. Rubio once argued for more compassionate federal immigration policies before shifting right on the issue perhaps most dear to the Republican Party’s base: immigration.

Mr. Rubio and his aides argue that migrant trafficking will ebb if crime groups and their allies in governments are dismantled, and that clamping down on migration will choke off a key income source for the gangs.

In keeping with Mr. Trump’s imperial approach to the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Rubio wants to roll back Latin America’s growing economic ties with China. For years, he spoke of Beijing’s global influence as a security threat, though he has tempered that language recently as Mr. Trump seeks a summit with China’s leader.

After becoming secretary of state, Mr. Rubio began his first official trip with a visit to Panama, where he toured the Panama Canal and pressed Panamanian leaders over the operation of two ports on the waterway by a Hong Kong company. Following Mr. Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal, the company agreed in March to sell the ports to a U.S.-led investment group, although the Chinese government has objected.

Mr. Rubio also raised the issue of China’s presence during his second trip to the region, visiting Jamaica, Guyana and Suriname in March.

And Mr. Rubio is on a mission to bolster the standing of right-wing figures in the region. He has taken up a pet cause of Mr. Trump: the defense of Jair Bolsonaro, the conservative former president of Brazil who was officially charged with plotting a coup. Mr. Rubio announced on social media on Thursday that the United States would respond to the decision earlier that day by Brazil’s Supreme Court to convict Mr. Bolsonaro and sentence him to 27 years in prison.

Mr. Rubio has tried to quell concerns among some leaders who worry the United States is once again flexing its imperial muscle. In Mexico, where Mr. Rubio has designated several cartels as terrorist groups, President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned Washington for months against any attempt at unilateral U.S. military action on Mexican soil.

During his visit to Mexico City last week, Mr. Rubio stressed that the two governments had “reached a level of historic cooperation” in recent months — one he said “respects the integrity and the sovereignty of both countries.”

Drugs and Deportations

As a senator, Mr. Rubio was a passionate champion of human rights and the rule of law abroad.

In a speech a decade ago, he called for a U.S. foreign policy built on military and economic strength, along with “clarity regarding America’s core values,” which he said included “a passionate defense of human rights” and “the strong support of democratic principles.”

But in going on the offensive in Latin America, Mr. Rubio has muted those views.

In addition to the boat attack, Mr. Rubio has played a major role in other aggressive policies that encompass actions without due process, including the deportation of hundreds of people he and the president say are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that they have designated a foreign terrorist organization. A vast majority did not have criminal records or clear, documented links to the gang, and courts have blocked further summary removals for now.

Under a deal Mr. Rubio reached with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in February, many of those deported have been sent to a prison that human rights groups call dangerous and “inhumane.”

Mr. Rubio has flatly dismissed the criticism as “anti-Bukele propaganda.”

A U.S. government document released in court this week said the Trump administration agreed to pay $4.76 million to El Salvador to temporarily accept up to 300 “members” of Tren de Aragua.

Rights groups have also harshly condemned Mr. Bukele’s government more broadly for what they call mass detentions, torture and a crackdown on democratic institutions.

His approach, though, has drastically reduced once-rampant crime and gang activity in the country.

That makes Mr. Bukele a model leader, in Mr. Rubio’s view.

After visiting Panama in February, Mr. Rubio traveled on to El Salvador to greet Mr. Bukele. The 44-year-old president, who projects a casually cool image, wore aviator sunglasses and a shirt unbuttoned low on his chest as he hosted the American diplomat at his bucolic lakeside compound.

Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.”

The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/11/multimedia/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:57:59.750857

The BIA’s first published gender decision in 1996, Matter of Kasinga, was consistent with both Acosta and UNHCR guidance.

Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground.","On July 18, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the highest administrative immigration tribunal in the United States, issued a decision, Matter of K-E-S-G-, holding that a “particular social group” (PSG), a key term in the legal definition of a refugee, cannot be defined by sex (the term used in the decision in lieu of “gender”), whether alone or in combination with nationality.

The asylum seeker in this case, a young Salvadoran woman, was terrorized by members of the MS-13 intent on forcing her to submit to them sexually. She fled the country only after the police refused to respond to her pleas for help, and her efforts to shake off her tormentors by relocating twice were unsuccessful.

The ruling in K-E-S-G- is unpersuasive, yet it is also entirely consistent with a decades-long trajectory in BIA jurisprudence. As someone who has litigated these cases since the 1990s, I can say that for years, the Board has pursued two related objectives – rendering the PSG ground virtually impossible to satisfy by imposing ever-more rigid and illogical requirements, while ensuring an interpretation that would place most women fleeing gender violence outside the ambit of refugee protection. These goals have the full support of the Trump administration, which took aggressive steps during its first term to do the same. The administration’s position is especially significant because immigration and BIA judges are not independent decision-makers, as are Article III judges, but are employees of the Department of Justice, required to follow Attorney General rulings. In his second term, the Trump Justice Department has continued its restrictive rulings on social group and gender. Following shortly on the heels of the BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, Attorney General Bondi issued two additional rulings which continue this trend by limiting social group and gender claims; respectively, Matter of R-E-R-M & J-D-R-M- and Matter of S-S-F-M-.

Moving Goalposts of the “Particular Social Group” Definition

Under U.S. law, derived from the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, a refugee is an individual with a well-founded fear of persecution “on account of” race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Convention drafters did not elaborate on the meaning of “particular social group,” but international refugee scholars have commented that its inclusion was to fill a possible gap in protection for claims not captured by the other four grounds, and subsequent case law in the United States and other jurisdictions has been consistent with that reading.

In 1985, the BIA had its first opportunity to interpret particular social group in Matter of Acosta. Noting the absence of interpretive guidance, the Board applied the doctrine of ejusdem generis which provides that a general term, included in a list of more specific terms, should be construed consistently with the specific terms. Reasoning that the other four Convention grounds refer to traits that a person cannot change, or should not be required to change to avoid persecution, the Board concluded that a “particular social group” is defined by immutable or fundamental characteristics, giving examples such as “sex, color, or kinship ties” or “shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.”

Acosta’s immutable/fundamental approach, often referred to as the “protected characteristics” test, was cited approvingly by tribunals in other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. At the same time as Acosta was decided, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began highlighting the relevance of the particular social group ground to claims by women seeking protection in its guidance. In three directives issued in 1985, 1991, and 1993, UNHCR recommended that although gender is not one of the five Convention grounds, women facing gender-based persecution could qualify as a particular social group and come within the refugee definition. UNHCR issued comprehensive guidance in affirmance of sex or gender based social groups in its 2002 Gender Guidelines. Although UNHCR guidance is not binding, the Board and other courts interpreting U.S. refugee law often look to UNHCR as persuasive authority, given that it provides authoritative interpretation on the international Convention from which U.S. law derives.

The BIA’s first published gender decision in 1996, Matter of Kasinga, was consistent with both Acosta and UNHCR guidance. It applied its immutable/fundamental analysis to grant protection to a woman fleeing female genital cutting, finding that she was a member of a social group defined by gender combined with other characteristics, including ethnicity and uncut status.

But only three years later, in Matter of R-A-, the BIA began to backtrack. It reversed a grant of asylum to a Guatemalan woman fleeing domestic violence, ruling that Acosta’s immutable/fundamental test was only a threshold, and that applicants must also show the proposed social group “was recognized and understood to be a societal faction,” which the BIA ruled, the applicant had failed to do. Attorney General Janet Reno vacated Matter of R-A-. She directed the BIA to decide the case once proposed regulations addressing gender claims which her Department of Justice had issued, were finalized – which, unfortunately, never occurred. (Notably, a February 2021 Executive Order committing to the promulgation of regulations on social group and gender claims by the Biden administration also never came to fruition.)

Beginning in 2006, the BIA formally ruled that a PSG could no longer be defined solely by immutable/fundamental characteristics. In a series of decisions, it added two additional requirements – particularity and social distinction. Particularity requires that a group be defined in a way that provides a “benchmark” for who is in, and who is out, while social distinction, previously referred to as “social visibility,” requires proof that the group is “perceived as a group by society.” In a previous article with Stephen Legomsky, we explained why we and other scholars disagree with the Board’s imposition of these two requirements.

Requiring proof of particularity and social distinction had a draconian impact on the success of social group claims, including those based on gender. The BIA’s only positive social group decision following the adoption of these criteria was Matter of A-R-C-G- in which the government stipulated to the cognizability of the social group.

The decision in A-R-C-G– was an early casualty of the first Trump administration. It was vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who wrote that “[h]ad the Board properly analyzed the issues,” rather than accepting the government’s stipulation, “it would have been clear that the particular social group was not cognizable.” During Biden’s term, Attorney General Merrick Garland reinstated A-R-C-G- as precedent, but Bondi vacated A-R-C-G- once again, by way of Matter of S-S-F-M- mentioned above.

What’s Next in K-E-S-G-?

The K-E-S-G- case was sent back to the immigration court for consideration of another form of relief, however its flawed reasoning will be challenged on appeal as it begins to be applied in other cases. In contrast to the BIA, a number of circuit courts have repeatedly recognized social groups based on gender, including groups defined solely by gender and nationality. In a series of decisions as early as 2005 and continuing to the present, courts have accepted gender plus nationality groups across a range of claims involving domestic violence, femicide, sexual assault, ritual harm inflicted on widows, and female genital cutting.

If upheld, the decision in K-E-S-G- would seriously undermine protection for women fleeing violations of their most fundamental human rights. But the weight of authority runs counter to its holding, and the decision’s rationales are particularly unconvincing.

The BIA disregards the growing body of contrary precedent, acknowledging only two of the many circuit court decisions that have recognized social groups defined by gender and nationality. It then attempts to discount one of those two by erroneously claiming that it was decided under a “prior definition” of social group.

The BIA leans heavily on the Third Circuit’s decision in Chavez-Chilel, which rejected the proposed group of “Guatemalan women.” But Chavez-Chilel is a confused and deeply flawed opinion. It misstates the governing law by holding that, for a group to be cognizable, every member must possess a well-founded fear of persecution. That has never been the standard. This reasoning improperly collapses two distinct elements of the refugee definition: the existence of a protected ground and the well-foundedness of the applicant’s fear. Numerous decisions have affirmed that each element must be considered separately.

The Board’s application of the social group requirements to the case before it – Salvadoran women – is perhaps the least persuasive aspect of the decision. While it concedes that the group’s defining characteristics are immutable, it rejects the claim on the basis of particularity and, having done so, declines to address social distinction. In effect, the entire rejection rests on its particularity analysis. The Board concludes that the group lacks particularity because it could encompass women of “varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.” Yet particularity requires only that a group be defined with sufficient clarity to establish its boundaries, and “Salvadoran women”—despite internal diversity—constitutes a group with clear and ascertainable limits. This is consistent with other findings of PSG in similar cases, such as the 1990 decision in Toboso-Alfonso, ruling that “Cuban homosexuals” is a cognizable group, which the BIA has more recently referenced as meeting the particularity and social distinction requirements.

In concluding—and perhaps in tacit recognition of the weakness of its legal analysis—the BIA turns to a quasi-policy justification for rejecting gender and nationality groups. It asserts that recognizing sex and nationality based social groups would amount to creating “another protected ground” under the statute, and that nothing in domestic law, the Refugee Convention and Protocol, or their negotiating history supports such an intent.

Whether the BIA genuinely believes that recognizing such groups would have this effect is debatable. In any event, the argument is peculiar. Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground. If it were, the recognition of every cognizable social group would constitute the creation of a new ground, a claim that has never been made.

Equally confounding is the BIA’s invocation of the Convention, the Protocol, and their negotiating history. UNHCR has for decades urged recognition of gender-defined social groups. Moreover, numerous State parties, through both legislation and jurisprudence, expressly recognize gender alone or gender-nationality groups.

The BIA’s efforts to justify its rejection of gender nationality social groups are ultimately unpersuasive. But K-E-S-G- will not be the final word. It is now up to the federal courts to address the issue. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright, the federal courts are no longer bound by Chevron deference to “reasonable” agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory terms. One can only hope they reach the same conclusion as the First Circuit in de Pena-Paniagua.

[I]is not clear why a . . . group defined as “women” or “women in country x” – without reference to additional limiting terms – fails either the ‘particularity’ or “social distinction” requirement. . . . [I]t is difficult to think of a country in which women are not viewed as “distinct” from other members of society. . . It is equally difficult to think of a country in which women do not form a “particular” and “well-defined” group of persons.

In the meantime, the BIA is obligated to decide each case on its own record, so attorneys should continue to argue gender/nationality groups, along with narrower groups which may be more likely to be accepted.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-11391582461.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:58:03.950332

The file noted that he worked for the South Korean engineering firm SFA, which did not respond to a request for comment.
They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.
ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.
“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued.","Almost 500 people were detained during a raid of a Georgia battery plant owned by two South Korean manufacturers last week, the largest immigration enforcement operation at one location in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.

But in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.

The Times obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest records for 11 of the detained workers. Six entered the country with B1 or B1/B2 visas, which are issued for business trips of up to six months. Four entered through the visa waiver program, which allows travel for 90 days. In one case, the worker’s status was unclear. The records stated that all but one of the 11 were working unlawfully at the time of the raid, but did not provide details about why.

In the one exception, agents said that although the worker “has not violated his visa,” the local ICE field office director “mandated” that he be considered someone who was voluntarily departing the country. The file noted that he worked for the South Korean engineering firm SFA, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Two-thirds of the people arrested on Sept. 4 were South Koreans, and nearly all of them were flown back to their home country this week. They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.

“What ICE is doing here is illegal, and people should be held to account,” said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration lawyer who is representing some of those who were detained. “If we’re turning from ‘let’s enforce the law against people who violate the law’ to ‘let’s enforce the law against everybody regardless of their legal status,’ I think we’ve changed the kind of country that we’ve become.”

The fallout from the operation at the plant was the latest example of the dragnet-like nature of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy and how it can conflict with other stated policy objectives, such as bolstering production in the United States. It also highlighted a strategy used by multinational firms to temporarily import workers into the United States to establish new operations.

The question of who will perform both the heavy manual labor and sophisticated technical jobs associated with advanced factories has taken on greater urgency in recent years as the federal government has pushed advanced manufacturing, often led by foreign companies.

The Trump administration has told its trading partners to either make their goods in America or pay steep tariffs, and leveraged hundreds of billions of dollars in investment commitments from South Korea, Japan and the European Union. The plant, which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and the battery supplier LG Energy Solution, is weeks from completion. Contractors were installing the sophisticated equipment needed to make batteries for electric vehicles.

Representatives from the battery plant joint venture did not return requests for comment, nor did spokespeople from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.

The B1 and combination B1/B2 visa — the kind held by several Georgia plant workers — is commonly used for business and tourism-related travel lasting less than six months, especially for consulting technical or scientific roles. A total of 4,906 B1/B2 visas were issued to South Koreans in the first five months of this year, according to government records, a small slice of the 2.86 million issued to all countries over the same period.

Robert Marton, an immigration lawyer with auto manufacturer clients other than Hyundai, said he had relied on B1 visas more in recent years as other programs for bringing in foreign workers had become more competitive.

Companies routinely bring in employees from elsewhere with H-1B visas, which allow someone to stay for several years. But those are capped in number, expensive to apply for and in high demand.

“The H-1B program has been restrictive as it’s been for years,” Mr. Marton said. “So I think lawyers like us are looking at workarounds and getting people in quickly.”

Obtaining a B1 visa requires submitting proof of the worker’s credentials, such as degree certificates, and proof of employment in someone’s home country. It is supposed to be used for consulting with business associates, negotiating contracts or attending conferences.

Jongwon Lee, a lawyer in Duluth, Ga., who has worked with South Korean companies operating in the state, said the official guidance left little clarity on how expansively the B1 visa could be interpreted.

“Installing software, giving instructions of how to set up machines, is that consulting or not?” Mr. Lee said. “Nobody knows. No update, no instruction, no case law.”

Instead, enforcement can play out in real time. ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.

The original warrant for the raid listed only four Hispanic individuals. According to Mr. Kuck, agents did not have any Korean speakers on hand during the raid and had to use apps to translate.

“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued. “They just transported everybody to the jail to sort it out later.”

The raid was part of an expansive deportation effort that the White House has choreographed throughout the United States this year, roping in several agencies that typically did not handle immigration matters as a way to meet Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House’s deputy chief of staff, has targeted 3,000 arrests a day. Work site enforcement is seen as a way to put large numbers on the board.

Nearly all of the 317 ​detained South Korean workers had planned to return home to rest but may consider returning to the construction site later, officials in Seoul said this week.​ One worker chose to stay in the United States with relatives who have green cards.

Typically, when foreigners accept a “voluntary departure,” it means they have acknowledged that they violated immigration laws and will not be allowed back into the United States. In this case, removal documents did not contain an admission of wrongdoing, and South Korean officials have demanded that the workers not face adverse consequences.

Along with the South Koreans, ICE agents picked up workers from Japan, China and Indonesia at the Georgia plant. The Mexican Consulate in Atlanta said 23 of its citizens had been detained, and the Colombian Consulate said it was aware of 19 Colombians.

Some of those from Central and South America, according to lawyers and an organization called Migrant Equity SouthEast, had valid work permits and were legally present in the country with Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Both are programs that the Trump administration has sought to dismantle.

Short-term business visa programs have been abused in the past — by employees who overstay their limits, as well as by employers. A pending class action lawsuit alleges that a contractor for a Hyundai subsidiary recruited engineers and technicians to work at a Georgia warehouse on TN visas. That visa category is intended for educated professionals from a prescribed list of occupations, but the workers say they were instead forced to do security, cleaning and packaging jobs.

It’s not clear whether anything similar was underway at the Hyundai-LG plant. Julia Solórzano, the legal and policy director of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, an immigrant rights group that helped bring that case, has been coordinating the response to the raid. Unlike workers in such operations in the past, she said, those who were not flown back to Seoul have not been released on bond.

“In this raid, it is notable that they seem to have taken so many of the workers into detention,” Ms. Solórzano said. “It makes it very hard to support people, and it creates conditions that make it hard for workers to fairly assess their immigration options.”

But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.

The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.

In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.

In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.

""I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,"" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.

The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.

Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.

The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.

But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances — like his efforts to fire certain executive officers — the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.

""What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,"" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a ""huge sweeping victory"" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.

Tariffs

The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.

The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.

The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.

The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.

The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.

Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.

In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.

Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.

The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.

The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.

Alien Enemies Act removals

Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a ""hostile nation"" if it is engaged in an ""invasion or predatory incursion"" of the U.S.

A ""60 Minutes"" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.

The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.

But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.

In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.

The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice — 24 hours — of their impending deportations.

The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua — preconditions to invoking the law.

The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision ""will not be the final say on the matter.""

Firings of members of independent agencies

Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.

In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.

The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.

Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.

But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.

At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a ""at least a fair prospect"" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.

""[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,"" he wrote.

Birthright citizenship

The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.

The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.

Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.

In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.

The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to ""being vindicated on appeal.""

The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/10/fd1f2e69-29e9-45d4-b0f6-1444933fab09/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ae08fc9338409810347b1e40bcf793d3/gettyimages-2222462629.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 06:57:04.981625

In the weeks leading up to July 9, Ayman Soliman told friends he was terrified of losing the sanctuary he’d found after fleeing Egypt in 2014 and building a new life as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

Soliman, 51, was to show up at 9 a.m. on that date for his first check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since losing his asylum status. He’d been granted the protections in 2018 under the first Trump administration. Then, in the last month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke them based on sharply disputed claims of fraud and aid to a terrorist group. Once President Donald Trump returned to office weeks later, court records show, immigration officials bumped up the terrorism claims and formalized the asylum termination June 3.

By the time of Soliman’s ICE appointment, friends said, he was distraught over the prospect of being returned to the regime that had jailed him for documenting protests as a journalist. He arrived at the agency’s field office in Blue Ash, Ohio, accompanied by fellow clergy and a couple of Democratic state lawmakers.

“I didn’t come to America seeking a better life. I was escaping death,” he said in a video filmed just before he entered.

Inside, Soliman’s attorneys said, he was shocked to find FBI agents waiting for him. They interrogated him for three hours about his charity work more than a decade ago in Egypt, the basis for the Department of Homeland Security accusations of illegal aid, or “material support,” to Islamist militants.

His lawyer eventually emerged from the ICE office holding a belt and a wallet. Soliman had been swept into custody, joining a record 61,000 people now in ICE detention. As he awaits an immigration court trial Sept. 25, he is being held in a county jail run by a sheriff who posted a sign outside reading, “Illegal Aliens Here.”

Legal observers are watching the chaplain’s case as a bellwether of the Trump administration’s ability to merge the vast federal powers of immigration and counterterrorism. The case is also a reminder, they say, of sweeping post-9/11 statutes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of abusing, especially in cases involving Muslims.

Material support laws ban almost any type of aid to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist groups, extending far beyond the basics of weapons, personnel and money. Prosecutors describe the laws as an invaluable tool against would-be attackers, but civil liberties groups have long complained of overreach.

Over the years, successive administrations have faced legal challenges over how they wield the power; a milestone Supreme Court decision during the Obama administration upheld the laws as constitutional. Now, however, there are particular fears about the material support “sledgehammer,” as one legal scholar put it, in the hands of Trump, who has been openlyhostile toward Muslims and determined to deport a million people who are in the United States without permission.

“These statutes are written extraordinarily broadly with the unstated premise that discretion will be exercised responsibly. And one thing this administration has shown is that it doesn’t understand what it means to exercise discretion responsibly,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who argued high-profile material support cases and served as national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

At issue are DHS allegations that Soliman’s involvement with an Islamic charity provided material support to the Muslim Brotherhood. But neither the charity nor the Brotherhood is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and an Egyptian court found no official ties between the groups.

Faith leaders call on Ohio governor to speak on behalf of jailed cleric

The Biden-era DHS, which first flagged the issue, said it would revoke Soliman’s asylum if “a preponderance of the evidence supports termination” after a hearing, according to the December notice. At the time, court records show, the material support allegation was listed as a secondary concern after more common asylum questions about the veracity of official documents and his claims of persecution in Egypt.

Once Trump came to power weeks later, Soliman’s attorneys said, the material support claims metastasized, with U.S. authorities declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a Tier III, or undesignated, terrorist group and adding new arguments about ties to Hamas. The Brotherhood, a nearly century-old Islamist political movement, renounced violence in the 1970s, though Hamas and other spinoffs are on the U.S. blacklist. In addition to the Egypt-related concerns, DHS filings about Soliman had noted warrants for “murder and terrorism” in Iraq — a country Soliman says he’s never visited.

By elevating the national security argument, Soliman’s lawyers said, DHS was able to bypass an immigration judge and order the chaplain held without bond as “potentially dangerous.” An established terrorism nexus means less transparency for immigrants — and more power for the authorities.

“DHS is judge, jury and executioner,” said Robert Ratliff, one of Soliman’s attorneys.

The idea of Soliman as a secret militant has outraged residents who know him locally as “the interfaith imam” and the first Muslim on the pastoral care team at Cincinnati Children’s, a top-ranked pediatric hospital. Colleagues described a popular chaplain with nicknames for the tiny patients and soothing words for their bleary-eyed parents.

Judy Ragsdale, the former pastoral care director who hired Soliman in 2021 shortly before retiring, said she wrote a letter to hospital leaders imploring them to speak out against the allegations that could return him to certain persecution in Egypt. He lost authorization to work in June, when his asylum was terminated.

“This is a ‘Schindler’s List’ moment,” Ragsdale said she told hospital leaders. “And if you don’t stand up for Ayman, you’re complicit in what’s happening to him.”

Some fear DHS is parlaying the scope and secrecy of counterterrorism laws into a weapon to boost the president’s mass-deportation mission.

Immigrant rights groups say a sped-up campaign with fewer guardrails for due process is already leading to removals based on evidence that hasn’t been fully vetted. If DHS is successful in test cases like Soliman’s, they say, material support claims could be more easily applied to immigration cases with even tenuous links to militant factions, including newly designated cartels.

The White House referred questions to Homeland Security, which routed a request for comment to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; a spokesperson there said in a statement that the agency generally “does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”

“An alien — even with a pending application or lawful status — is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” the statement said. The FBI declined to comment.

Jeffrey Breinholt, an architect of the material support statutes who spent three decades as a federal terrorism prosecutor, defends the laws as crucial to closing loopholes that were exploited by foreign militant groups and their domestic sympathizers.

Breinholt, who retired in 2024, said he has no concerns about the widening scope as it converges with Trump’s deportation push. The designation of cartels, he said, “is a natural outgrowth of the success we have had with ‘material support’ crime.”

To Cole and other critics, however, the Soliman case could be “the canary in the coal mine.”

More Than a Chaplain

Within a few hours of Soliman’s detention, dozens showed up for an impromptu rally and news conference in the ICE center parking lot. That backup has since grown into a hundreds-strong campaign to refute the DHS allegations, which supporters call a resurgence of anti-Muslim fearmongering that has persisted across party lines since the 9/11 attacks 24 years ago this month.

“Any time you have a brown man or a Muslim man and you use the words ‘FBI’ and ‘red flag,’ you don’t have to say any more,” said Tala Ali, a friend of Soliman’s who heads the board of a Cincinnati mosque where he sometimes led prayers.

Voices calling for Soliman’s release include parents who met him in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The families are in disbelief that the chaplain they’d grown close to is now jailed in a high-stakes international case. They knew he’d fled Egypt but said they were learning details of his ordeal through the campaign to free him.

“It would be very easy to be resentful and be angry with the world when you have to live through that kind of trauma, and he’s not like that at all. He’s taking on other peoples’ trauma,” said Heather Barrow, whose infant daughter, Mya, died in the NICU last year.

She said Soliman stepped in to spare her grieving family the heartache of making funeral arrangements for a 5-month-old. He attended Mya’s celebration of life and, later, a butterfly release on June 7, which would’ve been her first birthday. A month later, he was in an ICE cell.

“I was like, how is this happening? He was just at our house,” Barrow said.

Another couple, Taylor and Bryan McClain, also came to rely on Soliman when their newborn, Violette, arrived at Cincinnati Children’s last year with life-threatening complications. The chaplain steadied them during their 271 days in the NICU, which Taylor said felt like “a roller coaster in a tornado and it’s on fire.” The McClains call him “family.”

“I say with full confidence: Violette is alive because of the advocacy that Ayman gave us,” Taylor said one recent afternoon as she held her daughter, now just over a year old.

Clergy members make up another bloc of support — so many that they built a spreadsheet to divide visiting hours among imams, rabbis and pastors. Immigration advocates and Ohio civil rights leaders have added their names to petitions. So have University of Cincinnati student groups including the Ornithology Club and the Harry Potter Appreciation Club.

More than a dozen people faced criminal charges stemming from a melee after a rally in Soliman’s support; demonstrators and police blame each other for the violence July 17.

Two of Soliman’s fellow chaplains at Cincinnati Children’s, Adam Allen and Elizabeth Diop, said they lost their jobs for refusing to keep quiet about their jailed colleague. Meanwhile, the hospital, a cherished local institution, is taking heat for its silence. Soliman’s supporters launched a letter-writing campaign demanding a response from the hospital, which has said it does not discuss personnel issues.

Signs appeared outside the hospital. “Missing Chaplain,” they said. “Abducted By ICE.”

Cincinnati Children’s Hospital did not return messages seeking comment. In an internal memo published by The Cincinnati Enquirer, hospital CEO Dr. Steve Davis told employees that the lack of response “should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.” As a nonprofit, Davis stressed, the hospital has strict rules about “activities that could be characterized as political.”

Soliman’s supporters press on. One recent Sunday evening, about 200 filled a Cincinnati church where preachers from several faith backgrounds urged them to demand his freedom.

“The trial that Imam Ayman is going through is our trial,” Abdulhakim Mohamed, head of the North American Imams Fellowship, told the crowd. “His justice is ours to own. The injustice is also ours to bear.”

Escape From Egypt

Soliman’s entanglement with the Egyptian security apparatus began in 2000 when he joined fellow college students to protest repressive laws, he said in asylum papers.

He was periodically locked up and intimidated after that, he said. The persecution worsened more than a decade ago during uprisings that remade the Middle East by toppling dictators — including Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak — but in some places spiraled into civil war.

Soliman worked as a freelance journalist covering pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and neighboring Libya. Friends say he was also studying to become an imam and served on the board of a local chapter of the Islamic charity Al-Gameya al-Shareya, which is known for its network of hospitals and orphan programs throughout Egypt.

The charity, whose name has multiple English spellings, launched in 1912 and is often described as “one of the most established national Islamic organizations.” Scholars have written that early leaders came from the Muslim Brotherhood, archenemy of Egypt’s current military leadership, but that ties ended around 1990 under government pressure.

In the years since, researchers found, the group maintained smooth relations with the government as its more than 1,000 chapters nationwide encompass Egyptians of all political leanings. That delicate balance faltered briefly in 2013 when a military-led counterrevolution quashed the nascent democratic movement and deposed elected leaders who were part of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Egypt’s military rulers declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and shuttered any organization it suspected of ties. Al-Gameya Al-Shareya was among more than 1,000 civil society groups blacklisted in the crackdown, court filings say, and chapters suspected of helping the Brotherhood during elections were dissolved. The group resumed operations the next year, when an Egyptian court lifted the ban, ruling that the charity “has no ties to the Muslim Brotherhood,” according to news reports.

Egypt’s return to zero tolerance for dissidents made Soliman’s activism dangerous, he said in court papers. As a journalist and Islamic scholar, he represented two fields the Egyptian government views as existential threats: a free press and religious organizing.

Soliman fled to the United States in 2014 on a visitor visa and later filed a petition for asylum, describing how security forces over the years had locked him up on false charges and tortured him with electrical shocks. In one incident, his attorney said, Egyptian forces with machine guns stormed into an apartment where Soliman was asleep with his wife and young child. (Through attorneys, Soliman asked to withhold details about his family because they remain in Egypt.)

“For me, it’s life or death,” Soliman later told a U.S. immigration officer of his need to escape.

Officials in Cairo referred questions to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, which did not respond to requests for comment.

The asylum application asked whether Soliman had belonged to political parties or other associations in his home country. Ratliff, the attorney, said Soliman marked “yes” and attached a statement that mentioned Al-Gameya Al-Shareya and his role in fundraising for the local chapter.

Friends said Soliman rejoiced when he was granted asylum in 2018, under the first Trump administration, and sought permanent residency as the next step toward reuniting with his family. But the process stalled. “Bureaucratic hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle,” Ratliff said.

Then came a more serious snag. In 2021, Soliman learned he was on a federal watchlist when a background check for a chaplain job at an Oregon prison showed that the FBI had flagged him, court papers show.

His attorneys said they have no idea why. It could’ve been about a specific piece of intelligence. It could’ve been a misspelling or mistaken identity, simple errors that have landed ordinary Muslims on opaque “war on terror” watchlists that are nearly impossible to get off.

Soliman, friends say, insisted on trying to clear his name. With the help of the Muslim Legal Fund of America, he sued government agencies including the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. That route led to open-ended legal battles that yielded no clear answers and no green card.

Instead, his place in the country became more vulnerable. In December, the final stretch of the Biden administration, Soliman received notice that the government intended to terminate his asylum based on “inconsistencies” in his claims of persecution and concern that his charity work made him inadmissible based on “possible membership in a terrorist organization.”

Some of his friends are convinced it was payback for the lawsuits, but attorneys say there’s no telling what triggered a review.

“What Ayman has experienced is something that, post-9/11, has been the reality of Muslims in this country,” said Ali, his friend and advocate. “All he did was try to get answers and accountability for what he’d been put through.”

Big Claims, Little Transparency

Contested asylum cases like Soliman’s were prime targets when Trump took office the next month and supercharged deportations, a top campaign pledge. Since his return to office, ICE arrests have doubled.

Soliman was called to an asylum hearing in February, a month into the new administration, for a last shot at defending his eligibility. A DHS officer asked about claims in the Biden-era notice alleging “discrepancies in date and number of times he suffered harm” and raising doubts about a handwritten Egyptian police report and letters authenticating his journalistic work.

A transcript shows Soliman explaining that he sometimes got confused when describing traumatic incidents from years ago in English, his second language. He said the police report was a rough translation included by mistake and submitted statements verifying his journalism.

Then the DHS officer’s questioning took a turn: “When did you start supporting Al-Jameya Al-Shareya?”

For the rest of the meeting, the transcript shows, the officer drilled down on Soliman’s knowledge of the charity: fundraising, chapter size, support for violence and whether he had been aware of a Brotherhood link.

Another of Soliman’s attorneys interrupted when the immigration officer said the Brotherhood had been a Tier III group since 2012. That’s not how it works, the attorney countered — only top-tier terrorist organizations like al-Qaida or the Islamic State are given dates of designation. Tier III, she said, is for undesignated groups and is determined on a case-by-case basis, with the burden of proof on the government.

“Counsel, I’ll give you an opportunity at the end to make a closing,” the DHS officer said.

“I understand,” the attorney replied, “but we’re talking about something factual.”

The next time Soliman heard from DHS was the official termination of his asylum, effective June 3. This time, there was no hedging in language that declared he was ineligible based on “evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier III terrorist organization.” A few weeks later, he was taken into custody and notified of his pending removal.

Soliman’s legal team sued, arguing that he was stripped of asylum on illegal grounds because the designations had been made “without proper findings” and based on no new evidence.

Court filings show DHS attorneys introducing, then withdrawing or amending, materials to build a case linking Soliman to the Brotherhood through the charity.

“It looked like, ‘What can we put here to get to there?’” said Ratliff, a former immigration judge.

Among the supporting evidence filed by the government are three academic reports by scholars with deep knowledge of Islamic charities in Egypt. Soliman’s legal team filed statements from all three balking at how DHS had cherry-picked their research.

Steven Brooke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailed “important mistakes of fact and interpretation.” Neil Russell, an academic in Scotland, called the U.S. conclusions “a mischaracterization of my findings.” Marie Vannetzel, a French scholar who has conducted field research with Al-Gameya Al-Shareya, rebutted what she called “a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”

Vannetzel wrote that she rejects the idea that Soliman, “simply by virtue of his activity in the association, could be accused of providing material support to the Muslim Brotherhood.”

Observers of Cairo’s unsparing campaign to uproot Islamist opposition say the matter is clear-cut: If the charity survived the scrutiny of Egyptian intelligence, then it’s not Muslim Brotherhood. “It’s really striking that this group is not proscribed,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt specialist and U.S. program director of the nonprofit International Crisis Group.

Soliman’s attorneys also criticized the government’s assertion in court filings that he, as a board member of one local branch, would’ve been aware of any Brotherhood affiliation of chapters nationwide. “If a Rotarian in Seattle commits murder, we don’t go charging Rotarians in Des Moines with conspiracy,” Ratliff said.

Separate from U.S. attempts to tie Soliman to the Brotherhood was a puzzling footnote about Iraq that appeared in a later filing. Without detail, DHS attorneys alluded to warrants for “murder and terrorism activities.” Ratliff said a DHS attorney later confirmed to him in a phone call that it wasn’t about Soliman, but didn’t explain why it was there.

The error remained uncorrected in filings until Sept. 3, when DHS attorney Cheryl Gutridge acknowledged in court that it was an “inadvertent” reference to another case, Ohio news outlets reported. The original wording suggesting that Soliman faced murder charges in Iraq had been included in the government’s successful argument for keeping him in custody.

DHS did not address questions about the Iraq reference.

A close friend, Ahmed Elkady, said Soliman told him on a jail visit he was stunned to be linked to Iraq, a place he’s never been: “He said, ‘How can I become a virtual terrorist?”

A Sheriff’s ICE Fiefdom

As he awaits trial in immigration court, Soliman is in custody at the Butler County Jail, about 30 miles outside of Cincinnati, past cornfields and a German social club and the Town and Country Mobile Home Park.

For more than 20 years, this outpost has been the domain of Sheriff Richard Jones, a cowboy hat-wearing firebrand who keeps a framed photo of Trump in his office. In the run-up to the 2024 election, Jones mused that a Trump victory might put him “back in the deportation business.”

From 2003 to 2021, the jail had been contracted to house immigration detainees until the arrangement dissolved in the Biden era. As predicted, the county entered into a new agreement with ICE in February, after Trump returned to power, to hold around 400 detainees: $68 a day per person, plus $36 an hour for the sheriff’s office toward transportation.

Jones celebrated the restored partnership by posting a fake image showing inflatable gators outside the jail, a nod to ICE’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida. A Black Lives Matter group in Dayton issued a statement calling the sheriff’s post an “egregious act of cruelty and historical mockery.”

Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

As it returns to deportation work, the jail still faces a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in 2020 by two ICE prisoners who said they endured beatings and discrimination. One plaintiff, a Muslim, said a jailer called him a “fucking terrorist” and threatened to throw his prayer rug in the toilet. Jones has disputed the claims.

The sheriff is in the news again because of Soliman. In court filings, the Muslim chaplain says he was denied access to a space where he could lead communal prayers and then placed in “isolation” for nearly a week with only an hour of phone access between midnight and 1 a.m.

Soliman’s attorneys say in court papers that the episode was related to “targeted harassment” over his religion. The sheriff’s office told local outlets that it respects religious freedom and said Soliman was placed in isolation because he was “argumentative” and “threatening.”

After agreeing to an interview with ProPublica, Jones later decided he was “no longer interested,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Deputy Kim Peters, wrote in a text message.

As he languishes in jail, Soliman’s empty apartment in Cincinnati has become a way station for an inner circle of supporters, who said they felt like “intruders” when they first gathered there. Soliman is known as an elegant dresser, but his apartment was in bachelor-pad disarray, a reflection of his long hours at the hospital and the abruptness of his detention, said his friends, also clerics. The imams laughed when one confessed that he first thought the FBI had ransacked the place.

Over water bottles and energy drinks scavenged from Soliman’s fridge, they talked about the deportation threat. In Egypt, pro-government news outlets already have trumpeted the case as proof that Soliman was leading a secret Brotherhood cell in America.

Despite Soliman’s predicament, they said, being in limbo here is preferable to the alternative.

“You think I’m afraid of being here in jail?” Soliman told fellow imam Ihab Alsaghier during a recent visit. “Every moment I’m alone, I imagine I’m on a flight back to Egypt.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ayman-Clapping.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 05:58:22.020255

Critics have slammed the Trump administration for ICE's tactics of randomly apprehending non-white men, particularly Latinos, in sweeps where undocumented migrants live or work.
The Trump administration insists its approach is working.
During a White House briefing on Tuesday, when a reporter asked about American citizens' concerns that they could be swept up in the immigration enforcement, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off the question.","They're the most visible symbol of what U.S. President Donald Trump pledges will be ""the largest mass deportation in history.""

They're the armed officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), often masked and unidentified, wearing plain clothes under protective vests, arresting people in towns and cities across the country.

ICE made roughly three times as many arrests from May through July compared with the same period last year, according to the latest government figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request by the Deportation Data Project, led by the University of California Berkeley School of Law.

But those same figures do not show a comparable increase in the number of people with a criminal history getting picked up by ICE. Roughly half of the 61,000 people currently held in immigration detention in the U.S. have neither a criminal record nor face a criminal charge, according to the data.

The evidence belies the Trump administration's claim that its immigration crackdown is targeting ""the worst of the worst,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst and attorney at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

Bush-Joseph says the statistics reflect the tactics ICE officers are using to dramatically ramp up their arrest numbers under direction from the White House.

""They're going to places where they think there will be lots of unauthorized immigrants and trying to arrest as many people as they can there,"" she told CBC News, ""people who are going to U.S. immigration courts for their asylum hearings and asylum offices are being arrested and detained.""

Supreme Court endorsement

The data shows immigration arrests nationwide averaged roughly 300 per day throughout 2024. Following Trump's inauguration in January, arrests doubled almost overnight to roughly 600 per day, then spiked again in May, reaching more than 1,000 per day in June.

Critics have slammed the Trump administration for ICE's tactics of randomly apprehending non-white men, particularly Latinos, in sweeps where undocumented migrants live or work.

A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court this week endorsed such tactics — at least for now.

In a 6-3 decision, the court's conservative majority lifted a California judge's order that had temporarily banned agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

But the Supreme Court's decision is not the final word on the case.

The courts have yet to hear full arguments about whether the tactics violate the U.S. Constitution's protections against unreasonable arrest. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 24 in a district court in California, and the case is widely expected to end up in the Supreme Court's hands in the coming months.

Mike Fox, a legal fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington, says ICE is using unconstitutional methods to ramp up the number of migrants it's arresting.

""The numbers are going to be a lot lower if you're actually focusing on the violent people that you should be focusing on,"" said Fox. ""It's a lot easier to just stand outside a Home Depot and round people up.""

Fox says he believes most Americans want ICE to target violent offenders for deportation, not ""someone who came here for a better life… trying to make an honest living.""

The Trump administration insists its approach is working.

""As a result of this unprecedented effort, scores of gang members and national security threats have been taken off our streets,"" said a White House news release on Tuesday.

During a White House briefing on Tuesday, when a reporter asked about American citizens' concerns that they could be swept up in the immigration enforcement, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off the question.

""They should not be concerned because this administration is focused on the detention and deportation of illegal alien criminals who broke our nation's immigration laws,"" she said.

""When ICE goes out to conduct a targeted operation to deport illegal criminals from our community, they are doing so with intelligence… in most cases with the backing of local law enforcement who know exactly where these illegal alien criminals and drug traffickers and drug dealers are hiding in plain sight.""

While the White House likes to highlight examples of violent criminals picked up by ICE and trumpet the drop in illegal crossings of the border with Mexico, reaching its reported goal of deporting one million migrants per year appears impossible without going after people who have no criminal history.

According to ICE's own figures, made public in a letter to a congressman last September, the agency was tracking about 425,000 immigrants with criminal convictions who were not in detention and another 222,000 with pending criminal charges. (Roughly 20 per cent of the combined total was convicted or charged with traffic offences.)

Even if every one of those immigrants with convictions or charges is detained and deported within a year, that leaves the administration some 350,000 short of the target.

""As immigration enforcement increases, the per cent of those arrested who are convicted of a crime decreases,"" said the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think-tank funded by the NEO Foundation charity, in its analysis of data from the first six months following Trump's inauguration.

Another non-partisan, non-profit organization found the administration ramped up its volume of immigration-related arrests in an ""indiscriminate and unfocused"" way.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5239582.1751063770!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-officers.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-12 06:57:01.168837

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a restraining order from a judge that had restricted immigration agents from stopping people around L.A. solely based on their race, language, job or location. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was quick to criticize the decision and argued it could lead to officials targeting “anyone who looks Latino.”

When The View panelist Sara Haines asked Ferrera her reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision, the Barbie actress responded, “First of all, thank God for Justice Sotomayor.”

Ferrera, who is an activist for immigration rights, went on to say she was grateful for “people who still speak with a voice of reason and the values we recognize as American values” amid the decision.

“As an American, I’m angered and terrified to watch our constitutional rights be eroded by the Supreme Court. Everyone should be angered and terrified by it,” she said. “If any American can get pulled over because of the language they speak or the color of their skin or because they work in a low-wage job, who’s safe? So, as an American, I’m pissed off.”

She also spoke about being “a daughter of immigrants who grew up in California.”

She said that the family often had “conversations about immigration,” though they weren’t “close to what we’re living in now.” Ferrera continued, “I remember what it felt like to be a child in elementary school, going to school hearing whisperings and not knowing what that meant.”

“What I know right now is there are children that are terrified. There are children that are terrified, there are families that are terrified of their lives being destroyed in a moment,” Ferrera said. “I think about them, and I think we all have an opportunity to remember who we are and what we believe and what our values are and what we care about and to recognize that there are people suffering and that we all have the capacity to be human and to reach out and to care for each other.”

Ferrera opened up about the topic just two days after Sotomayor appeared on the Tuesday episode of The View. During her appearance, panelist Sunny Hostin asked Sotomayor about her recent dissents, including the one in the court’s immigration stops ruling earlier this week, and what she thought Americans should take away from what she wrote.

“Read the decisions, and not just my dissents, but the other side, too. Become informed citizens and not just reactive, because people will say things that are simply not there, or say things and misconstrue them,” Sotomayor urged the public. “The price we pay is whatever is happening today, as I indicated it’s going to affect a lot of people, but it affects your future and it affects the conduct of leaders in the future, because what we permit today is not going to be duplicated exactly tomorrow, it’s going to be something different.”",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-19088688002.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 04:56:43.697841

California’s Legislature is believed to be the first to pass such a bill, though similar proposals have been introduced in other states and Congress.

The legislation now goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose support is not certain. The legislation, passed by Democratic lawmakers who control both houses of the State Legislature, would apply to local and federal agencies, and questions have been raised about whether the state has the legal ability to regulate federal agents.

“We’re looking at the constitutionality of it,” Mr. Newsom said in July in an interview with the Tennessee Holler, a liberal news site.

The Democratic governor explained at the time that he understood that officers may need masks to protect their safety in limited circumstances, but that he thought it was “insane” how widespread the practice had become.

Supporters of the bill said on Thursday that the ban was even more urgent in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this week that allowed federal agents to resume immigration stops based on factors including ethnicity and if someone is speaking Spanish.

“We are in a truly disaster of a situation where we have secret police, effectively, on our streets,” said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who wrote the bill.

“It’s tearing apart the fabric of society,” he added. “You have communities in Southern California where people are scared to go out on the street, they’re scared to go to work, they’re scared to bring their kids to school. And now is the time for us to say what the rules are.”

Mr. Wiener’s legislation would bar officers from wearing face coverings that shield their identities, such as the ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters that have become common in recent months during President Trump’s immigration crackdown. It does not apply to medical masks, clear plastic face shields, respirators, eye protection or other safety devices.

The bill would take effect in January if signed by Mr. Newsom. The governor has until Oct. 12 to act on the legislation.

Numerous lawmakers described fear and anxiety in California’s many Latino communities. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area, said that one of her constituents was so afraid of immigration agents that he ran onto a freeway and died. She said that her own family members have begun carrying their passports at all times.

“That’s a very strange reality,” Ms. Pérez said.

Opponents of the California bill, including numerous law enforcement agencies, argued that officers must have the choice to cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retaliation. Limiting the ways officers can keep themselves safe will make it harder to recruit people to work in law enforcement, they said.

“Bad guys wear masks because they don’t want to get caught. Good guys wear masks because they don’t want to get killed,” said Kelly Seyarto, a Republican state senator from Riverside County. “It’s that simple.”

He also argued that the state doesn’t have the power to regulate federal agencies, so that part of the bill is likely to be thrown out in court, and that the bill would wind up creating new civil liability for local officers because of how it would be enforced.

Mr. Wiener pointed to an opinion from the legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, who argued that the policy is constitutional because it does not only apply to federal agencies. State and local governments can require that federal agencies comply with general laws, Mr. Chemerinsky wrote, such as speed limits and restrictions on the use of force.

“There is no rule saying that just because you work with federal government, you’re exempt from all state law,” Mr. Wiener said.

The California State Senate passed the bill on Thursday, two days after the State Assembly approved the legislation.

Similar bills have been introduced in other states — including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan — but have not yet passed.

California lawmakers also passed a companion bill on Thursday that would require local, state and federal agents to wear identifying information such as their name or badge number. That bill was less controversial, and while some law enforcement agencies opposed it, the legislation received support from the major association representing local police officers in California.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.

However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.

“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”

Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE.

As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.

After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences.

“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges.

Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”

A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early. (That’s up to the Parole Board.)

Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.

“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.

Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.

Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.

A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.

DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.

Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol.

The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.

In a letter Thursday, Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s director of policy research, told McKinney that the administration would not participate in Friday’s hearing. He wrote that the Urban Affairs Committee lacks legal jurisdiction and oversight authority on the matter.

Zoeller also challenged McKinney’s assertion about prison crowding, writing that the state law cited by the lawmaker does not apply.

“An emergency declaration is only required when the department’s system-wide inmate population is over 140% of operational capacity,” Zoeller wrote. “The current average daily population for all NDCS facilities is approximately 115% of system-wide operational capacity.”

Zoeller said the Pillen administration believes it has taken the appropriate action in informing Judiciary Committee members of its plan.

Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.

“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.

While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English.

Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services.

No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”

Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”

Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.

What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission.

Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.

A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.

“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”

Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said.

But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.

After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.

In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday.","“These conditions have nothing to do with homelessness,” said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, one of the organizations that filed the suit. “It’s carrying out a political agenda in a program that should never be partisan.”

The suit contends that the conditions violate the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to dictate spending, and conflict with grant-making rules. The housing department did not respond to a request for comment.

King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, filed a similar lawsuit this year when the administration attached conditions to homelessness funds that had already been awarded, including compliance with Mr. Trump’s executive orders on abortion and transgender rights. A federal judge in May temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing those demands.

Beyond escalating the administration’s maximalist tactics, the latest rule revision underscores the slow pace of federal aid, despite levels of homelessness often deemed an emergency. Though Congress approved $75 million to build supportive housing in 2023 (and added $100 million the next year), none has been awarded, much less spent.

The administration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ran a competition for the homelessness grants through HUD that concluded in late 2024 but announced no winners before Mr. Biden left office. The Trump administration ran the competition again and notified members of Congress of the winners in August, but it never publicly announced the awards. Last Friday, the administration started a new competition, with applications due in a week because the money expires at the end of the month.

The new, last-minute application reorients the program, called CoC Builds, to help seniors and the disabled and imposes a set of ideological screens, some of which are beyond applicants’ control. It disqualifies groups located in any city, county or state that fails to enforce homeless-encampment bans or cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws.

In addition, it penalizes programs that operate clean needle programs for drug users, that are based in places that do not map sex offenders or that “promote the notion that sex is a mutable or chosen characteristic.”

While it is not clear how HUD will judge compliance, an analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that programs in only nine states, all Republican strongholds, are likely to fully meet the conditions.

The second plaintiff in the suit, the Women’s Development Corporation in Providence, R.I., was among the groups that thought they had won the first competition run by the Trump administration. Last month, the group received a congratulatory call from the office of Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, saying it would receive $7 million from HUD to build 14 new apartments and provide services for the homeless.

Mr. Reed’s office was so confident in HUD’s notification of the funding that it issued a news release. But the official HUD announcement never came, and a new competition was announced.

Frank T. Shea, the group’s executive director, said the new conditions would prevent it from reapplying because Providence lacks an encampment ban and Rhode Island is at odds with the administration on immigration enforcement. In addition, he said, the group would be penalized for having transgender people on its staff.

“None of these factors are relevant to whether this would be a good project, and some we have no control over,” he said.

Internal State Department and U.S.A.I.D. documents and correspondence obtained by The New York Times show that several international organizations, including the Gates Foundation and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, had offered to buy or accept a donation of the contraceptives. The government would have incurred no costs or might have even been able to recoup taxpayer funds under those scenarios.

Instead the administration decided to proceed with destroying the products, an operation that was estimated to cost $167,000.

On Thursday, a spokeswoman for U.S.A.I.D. — which is now being wound down by Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget — said in a statement to The Times that the contraceptives had been destroyed, and falsely suggested that they induced abortion.

“President Trump is committed to protecting the lives of unborn children all around the world,” the statement said. “The administration will no longer supply abortifacient birth control under the guise of foreign aid.”

U.S.A.I.D. is prohibited by law from procuring abortifacients. None of the products held in the warehouse in Belgium were abortifacients, according to inventory lists obtained by The Times. The listed products, such as hormonal implants, stop pregnancy by preventing ovulation or fertilization.

This fact had repeatedly been made clear to State Department officials by veteran global health program staff, the documents show.

It is not clear exactly when or where the destruction took place, and administration officials did not respond to requests for further comment.

“The deliberate destruction of nearly $10 million worth of contraceptives, under the blatantly false pretense that they are abortifacients, is an outrageous act of cruelty,” said Beth Schlachter, director of U.S. external relations for MSI Reproductive Choices, an organization that had repeatedly offered to take over the distribution of the supplies rather than see them destroyed.

“This decision will cost lives, derail progress in global health and strip millions of people of the basic tools they need to plan their families and protect their health,” she said.

In early February, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took over U.S.A.I.D., which was established in the 1960s as a separate agency under Congressional mandate, and began overseeing its closure, a goal sought by several top Trump aides. The few foreign aid contracts that officials kept were moved into the State Department. Employees of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the group formed by Elon Musk, were sent to lead the process.

The destruction of the contraceptives was ordered in June by Jeremy Lewin, the State Department’s senior official in charge of foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom. In an email, he directed department employees to arrange destruction of the contraceptives as “the cheapest option that best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

But for a time, it seemed as though the American government was not following through on the plan.

The Belgian government staged a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to prevent the contraceptives from being incinerated at a medical waste facility. The foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, wrote to Mr. Rubio to try to prevent it, according to a Belgian foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic matter.

More recently, authorities in Flanders, the region where the warehouse is, had been trying to invoke a legal ban on incinerating still-usable medical products to prevent the destruction.

Those overtures seemed at least to delay the planned incineration. The stockpile did not appear to have been burned by the end of July, as earlier reports had suggested that it would be.

On July 31, Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said at a news conference that the agency was in the process “of determining the way forward.”

As recently as this week, Flemish authorities had not learned of the destruction and remained hopeful that they might reach a solution.

“We did not receive a formal derogation request to allow incineration,” Tom Demeyer, a spokesman for the Flemish environment and agriculture minister, said in an email on Thursday. “We are waiting for the outcome of the legal and technical analysis to see which channels for reuse are viable.”

Belgian authorities had hoped that they might be able to help facilitate a sale of the products, given ample interest from potential buyers. Belgian and Flemish authorities did not immediately comment on the news that the Trump administration had proceeded with the incineration of the birth control supplies.

U.S.A.I.D. employees had informed the administration that seven different organizations were willing to take charge of some or all of the products, and to cover the costs of storing, shipping and distributing them.

A draft memo prepared by veteran U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had worked on family planning programs through multiple administrations recommended that Mr. Lewin sell the products to the United Nations Population Fund because it would recoup at least $7 million and incur no further cost to taxpayers. The other options presented including selling to other organizations or donating the products.

Using the acronym USG for U.S. government, that memo noted that the cost of destruction “is estimated to be a loss of $9.9 M in USG funding,” and said that was “coupled with an estimated $167,000 in destruction costs.”

“Additional funding will likely have to be obligated to cover the destruction costs,” the memo said.

However, political appointees at U.S.A.I.D. instead presented a different memo recommending that the materials be destroyed “due to the absence of eligible buyers” and to avoid contravening an administration directive “halting support to organizations involved in coercive reproductive practices.”

Fourteen minutes after receiving that memo, Mr. Lewin ordered the destruction.

Former U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had moved to a new global health division at the State Department swiftly set about organizing the destruction. Clint Branam, U.S.A.I.D.’s deputy chief of staff for programs, wrote to his colleagues, “I understand this likely wasn’t the outcome you’d hoped for and it’s contentious, but Jeremy said it best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

In the list of potential arguments against a sale, officials invoked policies preventing the U.S. government from providing aid to overseas nongovernmental organizations that provide or help with access to abortions, based on a rule that the Trump administration reinstated. U.S.A.I.D. staff members offered solutions to donate the supply that they argued did not conflict with this policy.

At other points, the documents show that government staff members worried that a sale “could appear to be in conflict with administration priorities and attract external scrutiny.” Mr. Rubio transferred the remnants of U.S.A.I.D. from the State Department to Mr. Vought in August so Mr. Vought could oversee the final shutdown of the aid agency.

The State Department referred questions to U.S.A.I.D. on Thursday.

In this case, Republicans resorted to the move in an effort to steer around Democratic obstruction of Mr. Trump’s nominees, which has created a backlog of more than 100, angering the president and frustrating his allies in Congress. They framed it as a necessary step to grease the wheels of a chamber mired in partisan rancor and to return the Senate to its longstanding norm of confirming lower-level nominees without individual votes.

“For two centuries, most presidential nominees have sailed through this chamber by voice vote and by unanimous consent,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican. “That was the gold standard of advice and consent. Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats abandoned it.”

Democrats, vocally opposed to Mr. Trump’s policies and tactics, have demanded that every position be subject to individual consideration, delaying the approval of the president’s nominees and cluttering the Senate schedule. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said the change would do irreparable damage to the Senate and its constitutional prerogatives, rendering it “a conveyor belt for unqualified Trump nominees.”

“We are supposed to debate and take votes on nominees, especially when the executive branch is grossly breaking norms by sending us woefully unqualified, unscrupulous, and in some cases deeply dishonest individuals for powerful and important positions,” he said.

The rule change, which is expected to be finalized next week after a series of procedural votes, will allow the Senate to confirm an unlimited number of lower-level executive branch nominations at a time without the threat of a filibuster. That means Republicans will no longer be forced to negotiate with Democrats to agree on which nominees are deserving of speedy confirmation, as the majority currently must do, but will instead be able to steer around any opposition and push through dozens with a single vote.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, began the process on Monday by introducing 48 of Mr. Trump’s nominees together to allow them to be confirmed as a group.

That bloc covers a variety of positions, such as assistant secretaries in several cabinet departments, the inspector general at the C.I.A. and ambassadors, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former fiancée of Mr. Trump’s eldest son whom the president chose to be the ambassador to Greece.

The breadth of the list illustrates the far-reaching consequences of the rules change. Previously, senators needed 60 votes to bring a bloc of nominations to the floor, all but guaranteeing that both parties would haggle over who might be included.

Now, the party in power will have the ability to unilaterally approve dozens of executive branch nominees with little resistance. And while nominees must still win approval from Senate committees, there will be even less incentive for presidents to choose people who can draw bipartisan support, since members of the minority party will be presented with even fewer opportunities to delay or block anyone’s confirmation.

Republicans, who currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, pushed through the rules change on a 53-to-45 vote, turning to a tactic known as the “nuclear option” to set a new precedent that overrules what has been done in the past.

The dramatic name refers both to the extreme nature of the move and its assurance of mutual destruction: Republicans and Democrats alike must suffer the consequences when they find themselves in the minority.

It was once seen as so devastating to the Senate’s spirit of bipartisan compromise that leaders often threatened it but rarely followed through.

There were signs on Thursday that such concerns remained alive on Capitol Hill. Even after the Senate began voting on Mr. Thune’s initial step to begin the rule change, a bipartisan group of senators continued to haggle over an agreement to avoid the nuclear option, holding open the vote for much of the afternoon while they engaged in frenzied talks.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he believed there was a “considerable, good-faith desire to come to a rules change that is bipartisan and agreeable to most all of us.” He urged senators to cooperate to prove they could turn down the political temperature in the wake of the shooting death of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.

The proposal that senators were discussing would have capped the number of nominations that could be grouped together at 15. But those negotiating the deal would have needed the consent of all 100 senators to move forward, and while Democrats sought to work into the weekend to persuade their colleagues, Republicans were skeptical that a deal could be reached and instead moved ahead unilaterally.

“We were achingly close to a deal,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said on the Senate floor. “But I am afraid that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have run out of patience.”

But Mr. Thune, visibly frustrated, argued that Democrats had had months to come up with a deal to end their roadblock on nominees. “How much time is enough?” he said, addressing Mr. Schatz.

Currently, more than 1,000 executive branch positions require Senate confirmation. Traditionally, many picks below the cabinet level have been confirmed through voice votes or by unanimous consent, essentially an agreement by all senators to bypass debate. But senators in the minority retained the ability to block an individual nominee they found objectionable, slowing the process and allowing more time for the Senate to scrutinize them.

“We are steadily handing away most of the significant constitutional powers of the Senate,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. “That is very dangerous. What happened today with a narrow Republican majority to change the rules of the Senate and make it easier to confirm dozens and dozens of nominations just weakens our Constitution.”

Even with the rules change, some limits will remain. The new Senate precedent will not allow for group confirmations that include judicial appointments or high-profile jobs such as cabinet secretaries.

It does allow for group confirmations of federal prosecutors, at a time when Mr. Trump has pushed to install loyalists and erase the Justice Department’s independence from the White House.

Currently, another longstanding Senate tradition, the “blue slip,” allows home-state senators to essentially veto nominees for U.S. attorney in their home states. But Mr. Trump has demanded that Republicans abandon that custom, raising fears that it, too, could vanish in the face of a highly polarized political atmosphere.

That increased partisanship has seized the Senate, prompting party leaders to make rules changes that were once viewed as beyond the pale.

In 2013, Democrats lowered the filibuster threshold on most nominees to a simple majority, out of mounting frustration that Republicans were blocking Obama administration appointees to an influential court.

Four years later, Republicans retaliated by lowering the threshold for Supreme Court nominees. That move allowed Mr. Trump to put three justices on the bench during his first term.

In its motion, the Justice Department explicitly asked the judges to decide “by the close of business on Monday.” That is the day before the Fed’s voting members — including Ms. Cook — will begin a two-day meeting to determine whether to lower borrowing costs.

In a reply filed hours later, lawyers for Ms. Cook urged the court to reject that request, warning it plunge the Fed’s meeting “into turmoil” while carrying the “real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets.”

Mr. Trump has demanded for months that the Fed lower interest rates, but the central bank has kept them unchanged out of concern that the president’s policies could stoke inflation. At next week’s meeting, the Fed is widely expected to restart interest rate cuts that it paused at the beginning of the year, although officials are unlikely to approve a reduction as deep as Mr. Trump would prefer.

Interest rates at the Fed are set by the seven members of the Board of Governors, on which Ms. Cook serves, as well as a rotating set of five presidents from the regional reserve banks. The government is arguing that Ms. Cook should not be in attendance at that meeting.

The Fed, which is listed as a defendant in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit to block it from carrying out the president’s orders, has said it will abide by any court decision.

Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook in late August, claiming that she had engaged in mortgage fraud, even though she has not been charged or convicted of a crime. Still, the president said that the allegations alone met the threshold to dismiss her for “cause” under the Fed’s founding statute.

A District Court judge disagreed, and issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday blocking Mr. Trump from proceeding while the court considers the legality of the matter. In doing so, the judge, Jia Cobb, said that the law did not allow the president to fire Ms. Cook for alleged conduct that took place before the Senate confirmed her to the Fed in 2022.

Mr. Trump has spoken openly about his desire to remake the roster of the central bank with political loyalists who share his views on interest rates. This week, he gained an early victory in the Senate, where Republicans took the first steps toward confirming Stephen Miran, one of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, to fill an opening at the Fed created by the sudden departure of Adriana Kugler.

The expedited timeline could open the door for Mr. Miran to be confirmed in time for next week’s meeting.

“This testimony will help inform congressional efforts to ensure that our banking system has adequate safeguards against illicit activity,” the senators wrote in the letter.

Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is the ranking member on the banking committee.

The request for a hearing comes after an article was published this week by The New York Times Magazine examining JPMorgan’s more than 10-year banking relationship with Mr. Epstein during a period when the disgraced financier was found to have sexually abused teenage girls. The report found that the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags, including large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions, involving Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019, and his associates.

The letter to Mr. Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, noted that Deutsche Bank, which became Mr. Epstein’s main lender after JPMorgan severed ties with him in 2013, repeated many of the same errors.

“Testimony from JPMorgan and other institutions that processed Mr. Epstein’s transactions would provide valuable insight on where controls in the system failed,” the senators wrote. “The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein.”

Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said in a statement, “We now know in hindsight that any association with him was a mistake and we regret it.” She added, “We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation.”

Ms. Wexler said the bank fired Mr. Epstein as a client six years before his arrest on federal charges, and suggested the bank could have terminated the relationship earlier if the federal government had gone public with “damning information” obtained in the investigation that led to Mr. Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on state charges.

In recent weeks, a growing number of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties have called for greater transparency with regard to records the federal government has on Mr. Epstein.

On Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, introduced a bill aimed at compelling the Treasury Department to turn over copies of all suspicious activity reports filed by JPMorgan and other banks for thousands of transactions by Mr. Epstein, as well as dozens of his associates or business partners.

Also on Wednesday, Senate Republicans narrowly blocked an attempt by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files compiled by law enforcement agencies.

The revelations about Mr. Mandelson, and the fact that the government was caught off guard by them, are a stinging embarrassment to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was already reeling from the resignation last week of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, after a tax imbroglio.

It casts a shadow over the planned state visit to Britain next week of President Trump, who has praised Mr. Mandelson and met with him at the White House this week. Mr. Trump’s ties to Mr. Epstein have also come under renewed scrutiny after the release of documents by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.

Mr. Trump has denied drawing and signing a lewd greeting to Mr. Epstein for his 50th birthday, brushing aside questions about his association with Mr. Epstein as a Democratic conspiracy. But the British government has taken the disclosures more seriously, making Mr. Mandelson one of the most prominent political casualties of the Epstein affair.

The government singled out an email from Mr. Mandelson to Mr. Epstein in 2008, in which Mr. Mandelson lamented Mr. Epstein’s conviction for soliciting sex from a minor and gave him advice about his legal troubles.

“I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,” Mr. Mandelson wrote in an email obtained by Bloomberg News. “I can still barely understand it. It just could not happen in Britain.”

Such an expression of solidarity, sent when it was clear that Mr. Epstein was going to serve a prison sentence, made Mr. Mandelson’s position untenable, the Foreign Office made clear in a terse one-paragraph statement.

“Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information,” the statement said. “In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein’s crimes, he has been withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect.”

Mr. Starmer ordered Mr. Mandelson’s dismissal in a brief meeting with his foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who took her post only last Friday after a cabinet shake-up. In her previous job as home secretary, she introduced measures to strengthen the response of the police to violence against women and girls.

Mr. Mandelson’s friendship with Mr. Epstein was no secret. Government officials insisted they had vetted him before announcing his appointment last December. But they were clearly blindsided by newly revealed emails, published by Bloomberg on Wednesday night, in which he stood by Mr. Epstein even after his first conviction of state prostitution crimes in Palm Beach, Fla.

Mr. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex charges, in what was later ruled a suicide. Mr. Starmer had come under mounting pressure from opposition leaders and members of his own Labour Party to respond to the questions about Mr. Mandelson and share details of the government’s vetting.

The emails between Mr. Mandelson and Mr. Epstein were not available, either to the British officials vetting him or to Mr. Mandelson himself, because they came from an email account long since closed, a British official said on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.

Mr. Mandelson’s abrupt departure leaves vacant perhaps the most sensitive diplomatic post in the government. Among the names circulating as possible replacements is that of David Miliband, a former Labour foreign secretary.

Mr. Mandelson did not respond to a request for comment on his dismissal on Thursday. But he wrote in a message to The New York Times that Britain and the United States would announce a partnership on advanced technology next week, which he described as his “pride and joy” and his “legacy.”

He has long expressed regret in other interviews for his association with Mr. Epstein and voiced “profound” sympathy for his victims.

Speaking to Harry Cole, a journalist for The Sun tabloid, this week, Mr. Mandelson said it was “very embarrassing” to see his words published in a book of birthday greetings to Mr. Epstein. In the book, he called Mr. Epstein his “best pal,” and added a photo of himself clad in a white bathrobe, laughing with Mr. Epstein.

But Mr. Mandelson, 71, noted that the words were written “over 20 years ago.” He said he never witnessed wrongdoing while he was with Mr. Epstein, whom he visited at Mr. Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.

“I accepted assurances he had given me about his original indictment — the original criminal case in Florida,” Mr. Mandelson said to Mr. Cole. “Like very many people, I took at face value what he said.” He added, “I regret very much that I fell for his lies.”

When Mr. Starmer named Mr. Mandelson as his envoy to Mr. Trump’s Washington, political analysts said it was a bold choice but not without risk. Mr. Mandelson has had a long, checkered career in British politics. He helped craft the New Labour message that propelled Tony Blair into 10 Downing Street in 1997.

But Mr. Mandelson was forced to resign twice from the cabinet, once for failing to disclose a home loan he had taken, and a second time after allegations that he had tried to influence a passport application. (An official inquiry later cleared him of acting improperly over the passport dispute.)

His appointment as ambassador initially drew fierce criticism from allies of Mr. Trump. They pointed to statements he made during the president’s first term when he derided him as a “white nationalist” and a “danger to the world.” Mr. Mandelson apologized for the statements in an interview with Fox News.

He has since revised his characterization, positioning himself as one of the more sympathetic interpreters of Mr. Trump for a skeptical European audience.

“The president may not follow the traditional rulebook or conventional practice,” he said in a lecture last week at the Ditchley Foundation, outside London. “But he is a risk taker in a world where a ‘business as usual’ approach no longer works. Indeed, he seems to have an ironclad stomach for political risk, both at home and abroad.”

Mr. Mandelson made quick inroads after arriving in Washington. He became a fixture in social circles and a regular visitor to the White House. When Mr. Trump announced the outlines of a trade deal with Britain in May, Mr. Mandelson stood behind him in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump spoke by phone to Mr. Starmer.

After Mr. Trump invited him to say a few words, the president told him, “What a beautiful accent.”

Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Charlie Kirk, the conservative influencer and close Trump ally, had been shot while speaking at a Utah college campus. They briefed the president on the initial reports about Mr. Kirk, who had been struck in the neck.

In the hour that followed, the apparently shocked president asked for updates and took calls from a few reporters on his cellphone. Mr. Kirk, the president said, was a terrific man.

He was already speaking of Mr. Kirk in the past tense.

By then, Mr. Trump and White House aides knew that Mr. Kirk had not survived the shooting, according to two people familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Mr. Kirk’s death would be confirmed publicly a short time later.

Mr. Trump had a close relationship with Mr. Kirk, whose ability to galvanize young conservatives with his criticisms of the left had been crucial to rallying support among a new generation of voters. Mr. Kirk was also close friends with several people in the president’s orbit, including his eldest son, Donald Jr.

But by Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump’s shock had turned to fury. In a video address from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump declared it a “dark moment for America” and faulted the media and the “radical left” for language used to describe people like Mr. Kirk.

“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” said Mr. Trump, who one day earlier had been face-to-face with protesters in Washington who called him Hitler. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”

The fact that Mr. Trump faced two assassination attempts in 2024 — one of them a near miss at a rally in Butler, Pa. — is never far from the minds of his team, and Mr. Trump referenced the Butler shooting in his video. A handmade portrait hanging in the White House shows Mr. Trump being lifted to his feet on the rally stage in Butler, blood streaming from his ear as he pumped his fist.

Earlier at the White House, the corridors of the press offices — an area where reporters are able to move with relative ease — were quiet, as staff there absorbed news about a man many of them were either close with or admired.

Televisions affixed to walls in different rooms blared minute-to-minute coverage of Mr. Kirk’s shooting and then his death, as well as the ongoing search for the killer. Some staff members appeared to have been crying.

In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday. At around 5:30 p.m., a worker in black pants and a black shirt walked to the giant flagpole that Mr. Trump had installed on the North Lawn and cranked the flag down; he repeated the same move with the flag on top of the White House minutes later.

The president was still on track for a visit to New York on the anniversary of the last significant event to unite nearly all Americans across parties: the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Though it failed, Mr. Schumer’s proposal brought the contentious debate over the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, which has roiled the House, to the chamber that has largely avoided it.

Republicans in both bodies have sought to avoid a politically precarious vote on the Epstein files. President Trump has dismissed concerns over the Epstein files as a “Democratic hoax” and urged his right-wing supporters to move on, but his administration’s handling of the issue has inflamed many in the right-wing base.

Though lawmakers hoped the issue would die down over their August recess, it was revived this week when a key House committee released a note and sexually suggestive drawing addressed to Mr. Epstein that contained what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s signature.

Mr. Schumer proposed his Epstein measure as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill and then, using a maneuver available to him as the minority leader, teed up a procedural vote.

“If Republicans vote no, you’ll be saying to the American people that they should not see the Epstein files,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “I ask my Republican colleagues: After all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, told reporters that Mr. Schumer’s measure was a “stunt” and promised to dispense with it. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to table it.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she opposed Mr. Schumer’s measure because a similar amendment had been adopted on a spending bill that would fund the Justice Department. That bill has not yet been passed by the Senate, but Ms. Collins said it was a more appropriate vehicle for a measure on the Epstein files.

“It does not belong on the Department of Defense policy bill,” she said.

Mr. Schumer was not the first Democrat to try to force the Epstein issue through the Senate. But other efforts, including two from Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona and one from Jeff Merkley of Oregon, used different procedures that allowed them to be defeated without Republicans recording votes.

Mr. Schumer’s proposal was similar to a bipartisan resolution introduced in the House by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ro Khanna of California. The pair appear within weeks of being able to force a vote on their measure on the House floor, a move that would require the signatures of 218 House members on what is known as a discharge petition.

Their effort got a boost on Wednesday night, when Representative James Walkinshaw, Democrat of Virginia, was sworn in after winning a special election. Mr. Walkinshaw has vowed to sign the petition, which would bring the number of signatories to 217.

“Given the large amount of sensitive data under S.S.A.’s control, I consider the protection and security” of the information “to be a matter of first importance,” Mr. Crapo wrote.

The letter signaled that Republicans were examining the allegations made by Mr. Borges. He sat down last week with Republican and Democratic staff members of the Finance Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session.

In his whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Borges said that members of the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. The database contained records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, in addition to names, addresses and other details that could be used to steal identities.

Mr. Borges said that DOGE had bypassed the “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data, putting it at risk of being leaked or hacked.

Mr. Crapo’s letter was addressed to Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration. It asked him for information about how the agency had responded to Mr. Borges’s concerns, and whether it had followed normal risk-assessment protocols in allowing DOGE to copy the data to the server. The agency was asked to respond by Sept. 23.

Andrea Meza, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower group representing Mr. Borges, said in a statement that she welcomed Mr. Crapo’s letter as an “initial step.”

But she said it did not go far enough in seeking answers about the specifics of Mr. Borges’s complaint. She pointed out that Mr. Crapo was not seeking documents from the agency.

“Later this week, we will provide Congress with a recommended list of records to request that would offer far more insight than any self-assessment by the agency accused of wrongdoing,” Ms. Meza said. “If everything was proper, those documents reviewed by an independent investigator will show it.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint, which was first reported by The New York Times, did not indicate that the server set up by DOGE had been breached. A Social Security Administration spokesman said that the agency was not “aware of any compromise” to the database and that it was “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

Mr. Borges resigned three days after submitting his complaint, saying the agency had made it “impossible” for him to perform his duties “legally and ethically.”

Democrats on the Finance Committee this week called for Mr. Crapo to hold a hearing about Mr. Borges’s allegations and the broader state of Social Security. The agency was thrown into turmoil by Elon Musk, then the leader of DOGE, and his team of young software engineers, who advanced false claims of widespread fraud as they sought extraordinary power over closely guarded data.

Taylor Harvey, a spokesman for the Democratic members of the committee, said Mr. Crapo had not yet responded to their request for a hearing.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.
Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.
“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said.","The dreams of immigrants are “just collapsing,” Bishop Evelio Menjivar said before joining a panel of Catholic activists critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants’ imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents “don’t want to risk” their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On September 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration’s appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration’s approach is “to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.”

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go “home,” Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Migration Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said

it is “important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.”

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

“It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,” the El Paso bishop said. “We’re happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.”

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the “sensitive locations” policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said. “Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.”

Feasley said, “many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

“This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and peoples’ ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

“Particularly in this time,” she said, “our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision makers who would understand this.”",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-11 21:56:57.200772

FORMER DHS OFFICIAL HAILS ICE RAID ON GEORGIA EV PLANT AS 'GREAT DETERRENT' AGAINST HIRING ILLEGALS

Some 300 South Koreans were arrested last week along with 150 others at a Georgia construction site for a $4.3 billion Hyundai and LG Energy Solution factory to build car batteries.

The raid was touted by Trump administration immigration authorities but came at a delicate time in the relationship between the U.S. and its ally South Korea. The two nations are engaged in trade negotiations, and Trump has been encouraging South Korea to build plants in the U.S.

Lee said South Korean businesses operating in the U.S. were in a ""serious state of confusion.""

South Korean companies have said for years that they’ve struggled to obtain short-term work visas for their specialists and had come to rely on a lax interpretation of the immigration law that previous administrations had allowed for them.

After the raid, Washington and Seoul will engage in discussions about establishing a new visa category for Koreans, the nation’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, said.

""While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation.""
Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), an immigrant herself, called the bill ""Republicans' latest attempt to scapegoat and fearmonger about immigrants.""
US Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) also spoke out against the bill, saying on social media: ""It does nothing to protect communities or make us safer.
""I am deeply concerned that HR 3486 will lead to more violent attacks and unlawful arrests by ICE of the people I represent.","Eleven Democrats voted with Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Thursday to advance the so-called Stop Illegal Entry Act, which critics have condemned as ""dangerously overbroad"" as well as ""dehumanizing and horrific.""

The final vote was 226-197. The 11 Democrats who joined all GOP members present in backing the bill were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Laura Gillen (NY), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (Mich.), Frank Mrvan (Ind.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Tom Suozzi (NY), and Gabe Vasquez (NM).

Introduced by Congresswoman Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), HR 3486 would increase sentences for undocumented immigrants who repeatedly enter the United States illegally or enter the country and then commit a felony. The bill still needs Senate approval to reach the desk of Republican President Donald Trump, who supports it.

After Thursday's vote, Mike Zamore, the ACLU's national director of policy and government affairs, warned that ""HR 3486 would supercharge President Trump's reckless deportation drive, which is already damaging our economy and destabilizing communities.""

""This legislation would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets. It would also undermine public safety by diverting more resources away from youth services and prevention programs that actually improve community safety,"" Zamore said. ""While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation.""

""At a time when president is threatening American cities and the Supreme Court is greenlighting racial profiling, it is vital that a growing number of elected officials are standing together in rejecting Stephen Miller's dystopian agenda to criminalize and demonize people who come to this country seeking a better life,"" he added, calling out the White House deputy chief of staff for policy infamous for various anti-migrant initiatives from Trump's first term, including forcible separation of families.

Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), an immigrant herself, called the bill ""Republicans' latest attempt to scapegoat and fearmonger about immigrants.""

US Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) also spoke out against the bill, saying on social media: ""It does nothing to protect communities or make us safer. Instead, it piles on cruel mandatory minimums, explodes prison costs, and treats families seeking safety like violent criminals. We need real immigration reform, not another zero-tolerance failure.""

Congressman Dave Min (D-Calif.), the son of immigrants, said in a statement that ""in talking with local and state law enforcement officers, I learned that this bill will potentially make it harder for them to do their jobs. By increasing the scope of crimes that local police officers might be expected to enforce, while not providing any funding for this, HR 3486 would effectively reduce the resources our local law enforcement has to keep our communities safe and potentially lead to increases in violent crime.""

Min also pointed to the US Supreme Court's Monday ruling that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to engage in what critics have called ""blatant racial profiling.""

""This bill, combined with the Supreme Court's clearly wrong decision allowing ICE to detain people based on ethnicity, race, language, or place of employment, will give sweeping new authorities to ICE to perpetuate the mass incarceration of immigrants,"" he said.

Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented.
She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time.
Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it.
While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.","From her home-based day care in Washington D.C., Alma peers out the door and down the sidewalks. If they’re clear and there are no ICE agents out, she’ll give her coworker, an undocumented Latina who lives nearby, a call letting her know it’s safe to head in for work.

They have to be careful with the kids, too. Typically, she took the five children she cares for to the library on Wednesdays and out to parks throughout the week, but Alma — who is also undocumented — had to stop doing that in August, when President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district. Now, two of the kids she cares for are being pulled out of the day care. The parents said it was because they weren’t going outside.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and a wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into the district. ICE arrests there have increased tenfold. The situation has thrust the Latinas who hold up the nation’s child care sector into a perpetual state of panic. Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.

Many are missing work, and others are risking it because they simply can’t afford to lose pay, providers told The 19th. All are afraid they’ll be next.

“What kind of life is this?” said Alma, whose name The 19th has changed to protect her identity. “We are not delinquents, we are not bad people, we are here to work to support our family.”

Alma has been running a home-based day care for the past decade. She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time. With two kids being pulled, she will have to reduce her staffer’s hours as she tries to find children to fill those spots.

Her four school-age children also depend on her. This month, she had to write out a signed document detailing what should happen to her kids if she were to be detained. Her wish is that they be brought to detention with her.

“I can’t imagine my kids here without me,” she said.

She said she understands the president’s approach of expelling immigrants with criminal convictions from the country, but teachers who are working with kids? Who haven’t committed any crime?

By targeting them, she said, the administration is “destroying entire families.”

The Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association in D.C., which works with Latina child care providers, has seen this panic first hand for the past couple of weeks as more and more Latinas in child care have stopped coming into work. The center also helps workers obtain their associate’s degree in early childhood education, and since the semester started in mid-August, many teachers have asked for classes to be offered virtually so they don’t have to show up to campus at night.

Latinas have flocked to the child care industry for multiple reasons: Families seeking care value access to language education, and Latinas have a lower language barrier to entry, said Blanca Huezo, the program coordinator at the Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association.

“In general, this industry offers them an opportunity for a fresh start professionally in their own language and without leaving behind their culture,” Huezo said.

Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it. This year, the administration has narrowed opportunities for claiming asylum at the border, tried to bar certain groups from obtaining Temporary Protected Status and temporarily paused humanitarian protections for groups of migrants, thrusting more workers into the “undocumented” category.

The changes, coupled with increased enforcement, has fostered fear among Latinx people regardless of immigration status. That fear among workers is deepening a staffing crisis in an industry that already couldn’t afford additional losses, Huezo said.

“There is a shortage — and now even more,” she said. “There are many centers where nearly 99 percent of teachers are of Hispanic origin.”

Washington, D.C., has been a sanctuary city since 2020, where law enforcement cooperation with immigration officials was broadly prohibited. Earlier this year, however, Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed repealing that law and, in mid-August, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department Police Chief Pamela Smith gave officers leeway to share information with ICE about individuals they arrested or stopped.

“There was some peace that living in D.C. brought more security,” Huezo said. Now, “people don’t feel that freedom to walk through the streets.”

Child care centers are also no longer off limits for ICE raids. The centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his first day in office. While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.

A similar story of fear and surveillance has already played out in Los Angeles, where ICE conducted widespread raids earlier in the summer. Huezo said her organization has been in touch with child care providers in L.A. to learn about how they managed those months.

In the meantime, the best the organization can do, she said, is connect workers with as many resources as possible, including legal clinics, but the ones that help immigrants are at their maximum caseload. The group has put child care workers who are not leaving their homes in touch with an organization called Food Justice DMV that is delivering meals to their doorsteps. Prior to last month, people who needed food could fill out a form and get it that same week. Now, the wait time is two to three weeks, Huezo said. For those in Maryland and Virginia, it’s closer to a month.

Thalia, a teacher at a day care, said her coworkers have stopped coming to work. It’s all the staff talks about during their lunchtime conversations. When she rides the Metro into work, she looks over her shoulder for the ICE agents, their faces covered, who are often at the exits.

“They are hunting us,” she said.

Thalia, whose name has been changed because she is undocumented, has been living in the United States for nine years and working in child care that entire time. Like her, many of the Latina teachers she works with have earned certifications and degrees in early childhood education.

“We are working, we are cooperating, paying taxes,” she said. “We are there all day so other families can benefit from the child care.”

As a single mother, Thalia has also had to consider what would happen to her three children if she was detained. This past month, she retained a lawyer who could help them with their case in case anything were to happen. Her school-age kids know: Call the lawyer if mom is detained and get tickets to Guatemala to meet her there.

This is what she lives with every day now: “The fear of leaving your family and letting them know, ‘If I don’t return, it’s not because I am abandoning you.’”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dc-childcare_2.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 21:57:07.996270

More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.
“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC.

“This is going to give us minimum two to three months delay, because now all these people want to get back [to South Korea],” Muñoz said in Detroit, as reported by Bloomberg. “Then you need to see how can you fill those positions, and for the most part, those people are not in the U.S.”

When completed, the factory, jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is expected to hire thousands of American workers. It was originally slated to come online later this year.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carried out its largest single-site enforcement operation ever on Sept. 4, detaining nearly 500 people — mostly Korean nationals working on the technical components of building out the factory.

More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.

“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC. “There are a lot of skills and equipment that you cannot find in the United States.”

That has thrown company officials into a rush to fill in the gaps, the automaker executive said.

During a speech Sunday marking his first 100 days in office, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called on the Trump administration to adjust visa rules for some skilled positions or risk losing future investments in the U.S.

“It’s not like these are long-term workers,” the South Korean leader said. “When you build a factory or install equipment at a factory, you need technicians, but the United States doesn’t have that workforce and yet they won’t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work.”

Hyundai Motor Group Chair Euisun Chung also called for visa reform at the Detroit event Thursday, per Bloomberg’s report.

“I’m really worried about that incident and we’re really glad they’re returning home safely,” he said. “Our government and the U.S. government are working closely, and the visa regulation is very complicated.

(CN) — Three women held in immigration detention smiled, quietly broke into tears and hugged their lawyers in a federal courtroom Thursday after a judge ordered their release on bond.

“It’s so exciting to be able to reunite the individuals with their families,” said Grant Friedman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska, which represented one of the women. “This order shows the commitment to due process that needs to be respected.”

The women — Nicandra Ozuna Carlon, Yurenia Genchi Palma and Felipa Lorenzo Perez — were among those arrested in the June 10 immigration raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha and had been detained despite immigration judges ruling that they could be freed.

Federal authorities had continued their detention, though, citing what plaintiffs describe as a novel interpretation of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy on bond eligibility. Federal authorities now argue that only those already admitted to the U.S. can be released during removal proceedings, while everyone else must be detained under U.S. code.

Plaintiffs in these cases often describe this as a policy reversal. Previously, most individuals subject to removal proceedings who are found not to be a risk to the community could be released.

In Thursday’s cases, the women sued, and Senior U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Bataillon ordered their release during a hearing at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Courthouse in downtown Omaha.

It was not exactly a surprise. Bataillon has issued the same order for at least three other plaintiffs in similar cases related to the raid.

Still, there had been a new development: a decision on Friday by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the senior U.S. immigration law administrative body, which found that those already in the United States who have entered without authorization are subject to mandatory detention and that immigration judges have no authority to change their custody status.

But following arguments by attorneys, Bataillon agreed with the plaintiffs that he should release their clients anyway since they were being held under the same circumstances as earlier plaintiffs and that the board’s opinion was flawed.

“I disagree with their analysis, and my holding is the same as it was,” Bataillon said.

Eric W. Synowicki, an assistant United States attorney arguing for defendants, had told Bataillon there is a consensus among immigration judges in Nebraska that they can no longer issue bond and that the Board’s ruling applied in the three cases.

“Immigration judges lack authority to grant bond,” he said. “It applies. It is lawful.”

ICE has said many of those arrested engaged in identity theft to get their jobs. Plaintiffs in these cases often point to their own lack of a criminal record in making their claims.

The raid on Glenn Valley Foods rocked Omaha, a city partially built on the backs of immigrant meatpackers since the late 19th century. It came at the heels of video circulating around the city of ICE agents arresting a man in the dining room of a local restaurant in front of patrons during Sunday brunch.

The scene of the Glenn Valley raid was tense, with some throwing rocks at a line of SUVs carrying federal agents, shattering a window, according to some reports.

Immigration has continued to be a contentious issue in Nebraska.

Ochoa views these culinary activations as a form of support and advocacy for street vendors and a way to showcase the critical yet undervalued role they play in LA’s cultural and financial economy.

“As a child of tortilla vendors myself, I can attest to the strong work ethics of many in the vending community who have contributed vital and oftentimes underappreciated roles as providers of affordable quality foods,” Ochoa wrote in a letter of support for Cruz reviewed by Hyperallergic.

“Even though street vendors are statistically more likely to be targeted, harassed, or physically harmed compared to a brick-and-mortar store, Jorge Cruz and many business owners like him continue to work long hours to support themselves and their families,” Ochoa continued. “ I support Jorge Cruz as a person and a small business owner, and in doing so, I support my city.”

Erika Hirugami had invited Cruz to work at the upcoming reception for Concrete Hope, a photography exhibition she curated exploring diverse Latine and Indigenous identities, on October 14. In a call with Hyperallergic, she described Cruz as “essential to the arts community.”

Then, on the morning of August 27, as Cruz and his wife Carmen were returning home from dropping their four kids off at school, they were confronted by approximately six ICE agents.

“We were in our truck. One of their cars got in front of us, the other car got in back. ‘We have an order of arrest for Jorge Cruz,’ they said,” Carmen told Hyperallergic, recounting the incident. “[Jorge] was calm. They arrested him, put him in the car, and took him.”

Cruz called his wife a couple of hours later to tell her that he was in a detention center in downtown LA. The next day, he was moved to a detention center in Adelanto, about 90 miles (~144.8 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, where he is still being held. ICE has not yet responded to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment.

Carmen said she believes the reason for her husband’s abduction stemmed from a verbal altercation he had with another vendor several months ago. Police arrested both men, but the charges were dismissed.

“He went to court, and they gave him a paper saying the case was never filed,” she said. “He had no criminal charges, he was happy.”

Even so, this incident put a target on Cruz’s back, according to Mackenzie W. Mackins, an immigration attorney representing Cruz.

“They don’t care if it’s dismissed. Any contact with law enforcement puts you at the top of the list,” Mackins told Hyperallergic.

Cruz was undocumented when he arrived in the United States as a child, but was protected from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). He married Carmen, a US citizen, in 2014, and received his green card, which made him eligible to file for citizenship after three years. Mackins has been working with Cruz for years to help him become naturalized, but old arrests, mostly minor infractions related to unpermitted street vending, have made that difficult.

“We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” she said, explaining that immigration authorities were already trying to pursue removal because of his past record. “Our argument is, ‘He’s here. He has children, a wife. What’s the point of dragging this on?’”

Cruz is scheduled to have a bond hearing tomorrow morning, September 12. Mackins suggested that statements of support could help the case, and Hirugami started a letter-writing campaign in hopes of sending 200 letters to his lawyer to present in court. Those interested in attending Friday’s hearing at 8:30am PST can do so virtually.

However, due to recent changes to immigration law, anyone who entered the country illegally can be denied bond, according to Mackins. “He’s in a different category because he’s a lawful permanent resident,” she argued. “They should let him go back to his previous status, fighting his removal.”

Cruz’s story may be distressing and maddening, but it is sadly by no means unique. Since Trump took office this year, ICE arrests have reportedly doubled, and the number of people in detention has reached record highs.

“We see it firsthand — people trying to do the right thing to become part of the formal economy through pathways that advocacy groups have made possible,” Patrick Lennon of Revolution Carts told Hyperallergic. The company, which has partnered with Ochoa for several projects, manufactured the first-ever hot food push cart for vendors approved by the LA County Health Department in 2021, and counts Cruz among their first customers.

“[We] see someone like Jorge going through the citizenship process, paying taxes, when all of a sudden they’re picked up and detained,” Lennon said.",https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/jorge-cruz.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 18:56:52.918453

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional.
But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.
Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.
“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing.","At a federal courthouse in Omaha on Thursday, three women tearfully embraced their attorneys and each other after they were ordered to be released from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement custody.

Like the six others who had previously been released in nearly identical cases, the three women were detained during the June ICE raid on Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods meatpacking plant. They were granted bond by an immigration judge but were kept in ICE custody after the agency filed its intent to appeal the bond determination. That resulted in an “automatic stay,” which kept them behind bars as the appeal was decided.

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional. Yurenia Genchi Palma, Nicandra Ozuna Carlon and Felipa Lorenzo Perez will be released from custody within the next 24 hours.

Their release comes after last week’s decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals that found the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing regardless of how long they lived in the U.S. or their community ties. Advocates and attorneys say that interpretation goes against decades of precedent.

Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security had argued in both immigration court and federal court that any undocumented immigrant encountered within the U.S. may be treated as an “arriving alien” under Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and thus subject to mandatory detention.

For decades, Section 235 was understood to apply to people encountered while crossing the border or shortly thereafter, while Section 236 was understood to apply to undocumented immigrants who are encountered in the U.S. after residing in the country. People detained under Section 236, like those arrested during the Glenn Valley raid, were entitled to a bond determination hearing.

On July 8, interim guidance issued by ICE said the agency had “revised its legal position on detention and release authorities” and categorized every undocumented immigrant under Section 235.

That legal position was frequently rejected by immigration judges in Nebraska and elsewhere. Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is the highest administrative body for interpreting immigration laws.

While the Board’s decision is binding on immigration courts – meaning that most undocumented immigrants will not be eligible for bond hearings regardless of how long they’ve lived in the country – federal courts are not bound by the decision.

Bataillon said from the bench that he disagreed with the board’s analysis and decision. But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.

“The Court need not determine the validity of the government’s argument that petitioner should be mandatorily detained under [Section 235] nor the applicability of the BIA’s decision,” Bataillon wrote. “For the time being, the court is concerned only with the lawfulness of the automatic stay.”

That’s likely to change as more people sue after they are denied the opportunity for a bond hearing because of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision. Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.

“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing. “We will continue to see lawsuits across the country on this issue as more and more immigration judges start denying bond.”

At least four more lawsuits alleging wrongful detention by ICE after an immigration judge granted bond are pending in federal court in Nebraska.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/Screenshot_2025-06-17_131203.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-09-11 18:57:08.857701

The nation’s two largest teachers unions joined a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging the Trump administration’s immigration policy change allowing enforcement on school grounds and other sensitive locations.

Administrators of a private early childhood school in Oregon also joined the lawsuit, saying their jobs and the education of the children they serve were interrupted as a result of the administration’s policy change after Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehended a parent on school grounds.

The court documents describe “a violent ICE enforcement action on the school grounds” in mid-July that included law enforcement officers shattering the car window of a student’s father and detaining him while he was dropping off his 2-year-old. Following the incident, Oregon’s Guidepost Montessori School saw a drop in student attendance and in interest from new families, the new parties in the lawsuit claim.

The lawsuit was originally filed in April on behalf of parties including Latinx farmworker labor union Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. It is among a string of legal challenges seeking to undo the U.S. Department of Homeland Security policy change. The original lawsuit, as well as the document filed this week, claim that “attendance rates dropped in half and school administrators saw an influx of parents picking their children up from school in the middle of the day after hearing reports that immigration officials were in the area.”

K-12 leaders and lawsuits are increasingly reporting a significant and sometimes direct impact on students and parents as a result of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

In Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, ICE activity has included failed attempts to enter two elementary schools after officers allegedly lied about having parents’ permission to speak to students. In that incident, administrators denied the officers’ requests.

More recently, a high school student with disabilities was handcuffed and held at gunpoint “in an alleged case of mistaken identity” just prior to the start of the school year, according to LAUSD officials.

Many of the recorded incidents have taken place during student pickup or drop-off hours on or near school grounds.

Such incidents have created trauma and school avoidance, educators and immigration rights advocates said during a virtual press event last week.

But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.
U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country.
She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.
Starting from scratch back in Brazil Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.","It sounded like freedom, like a world of possibility beyond the orphanage walls.

Maria Pires was getting adopted. At 11 years old, she saw herself escaping the chaos and violence of the Sao Paulo orphanage, where she'd been sexually assaulted by a staff member. She saw herself leaving Brazil for America, trading abandonment for belonging.

A single man in his 40s, Floyd Sykes III, came to Sao Paulo to meet her. He signed some paperwork and brought Maria home.

She arrived in the suburbs of Baltimore in the summer of 1989, a little girl with a tousle of dark hair, a nervous smile and barely a dozen words of English. The sprawling subdivision looked idyllic, with rows of modest brick townhouses and a yard where she could play soccer.

She was, she believed, officially an American.

But what happened in that house would come to haunt her, marking the start of a long descent into violence, crime and mental illness.

""My father — my adopted father — he was supposed to save me,"" Pires said. Instead, he tortured and sexually abused her.

After nearly three years of abuse, Sykes was arrested. The state placed Pires in foster care.

By then, she was consumed with fury. In the worst years, she beat a teenager at a roller rink, leaving him in a coma. She attacked a prison guard and stabbed her cellmate with a sharpened toothbrush.

In prison, she discovered that no one had ever bothered to complete her immigration paperwork. Not Sykes. Not Maryland social service agencies.

That oversight would leave her without a country. She wasn't American, it turned out, and she'd lost her Brazilian citizenship when she was adopted by Sykes, who died several years ago. But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.

After her release from prison in 2017, Pires stayed out of trouble and sought help to control her anger. She checked in once a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and paid for an annual work permit.

But in the second Trump administration — with its promise of mass deportations, a slew of executive orders and a crackdown targeting those the president deemed ""the worst of the worst"" — everything changed. Trump's unyielding approach to immigration enforcement has swept up tens of thousands of immigrants, including many like Pires who came to the U.S. as children and know little, if any, life outside America. They have been apprehended during ICE raids, on college campuses, or elsewhere in their communities, and their detentions often draw the loudest backlash.

In Pires' case, she was detained during a routine check-in, sent to one immigration jail after another, and ultimately deported to a land she barely remembers. The Associated Press conducted hours of interviews with Pires and people who know her and reviewed Maryland court records, internal ICE communications, and adoption and immigration paperwork to tell her story.

U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country. Her case, they say, is cut and dried.

Pires, now 47, doesn't deny her criminal past.

But little about her story is straightforward.

A new chapter of childhood, marked by abuse

Pires has no clear memories from before she entered the orphanage. All she knows is that her mother spent time in a mental institution.

The organization that facilitated her adoption was later investigated by Brazilian authorities over allegations it charged exorbitant fees and used videos to market available children, according to a Sao Paulo newspaper. Organization leaders denied wrongdoing.

Pires remembers a crew filming a TV commercial. She believes that's how Sykes found her.

In his custody, the abuse escalated over time. When Sykes went to work, he sometimes left her locked in a room, chained to a radiator with only a bucket as a toilet. He gave her beer and overpowered her when she fought back. She started cutting herself.

Sykes ordered her to keep quiet, but she spoke almost no English then anyway. On one occasion, he forced a battery into her ear as punishment, causing permanent hearing loss.

In September 1992, someone alerted authorities. Sykes was arrested. Child welfare officials took custody of Maria, then 14.

Maryland Department of Human Services spokesperson Lilly Price said the agency couldn't comment on specific cases because of confidentiality laws but noted in a statement that adoptive parents are responsible for applying for U.S. citizenship for children adopted from other countries.

Court documents show Sykes admitted sexually assaulting Maria multiple times but he claimed the assaults stopped in June 1990.

He was later convicted of child abuse. Though he had no prior criminal record, court officials acknowledged a history of similar behavior, records show.

Between credit for time served and a suspended prison sentence, Sykes spent about two months in jail.

Sykes' younger sister Leslie Parrish said she's often wondered what happened to Maria.

""He ruined her life,"" she said, weeping. ""There's a special place in hell for people like that.""

Parrish said she wanted to believe her brother had good intentions; he seemed committed to becoming a father and joined a social group for adoptive parents of foreign kids. She even accompanied him to Brazil.

But in hindsight, she sees it differently. She believes sinister motives lurked ""in the back of his sick mind.""

At family gatherings, Maria didn't show obvious signs of distress, though the language barrier made communication difficult. Other behavior was explained away as the result of her troubled childhood in the orphanage, Parrish said.

""But behind closed doors, I don't know what happened.""

Years in prison, an eventual release

Pires' teenage years were hard. She drank too much and got kicked out of school for fighting. She ran away from foster homes, including places where people cared for her deeply.

""If ever there was a child who was cheated out of life, it was Maria,"" one foster mother wrote in later court filings. ""She is a beautiful person, but she has had a hard life for someone so young.""

She struggled to provide for herself, sometimes ending up homeless. ""My trauma was real bad,"" she said. ""I was on my own.""

She became angry and violent. She would fight anyone who crossed her.

At 18, she pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for the roller rink attack. She served two years in prison, where she finally learned basic reading and writing skills. It was then that authorities — and Pires herself — discovered she wasn't a U.S. citizen.

Her criminal record meant it would be extremely difficult to gain citizenship. Suddenly, she faced deportation.

Pires said she hadn't realized the potential consequences when accepting her plea deal.

""If l had any idea that I could be deported because of this, I would not have agreed to it,"" she wrote, according to court records. ""Going to jail was one thing, but I will lose everything if I am deported back to Brazil.""

A team of volunteer lawyers and advocates argued she shouldn't be punished for something beyond her control.

""Maria has absolutely no one and nothing in Brazil. She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.

Ultimately, the American judicial system agreed: Pires would be allowed to remain in the United States if she checked in annually with ICE, a fairly common process until Trump's second term.

""How's your mental?""

Pires didn't immediately take advantage of her second chance.

She was arrested for cocaine distribution in 2004 and for check fraud in 2007. While incarcerated, she picked up charges for stabbing her cellmate in the eye, burning an inmate with a flat iron and throwing hot water on a correctional officer. Her sentence was extended.

Pires said she spent several years in solitary confinement, exacerbating her mental health challenges.

Her release in 2017 marked a new beginning. Through therapy and other support services, she learned to manage her anger and stay out of trouble. She gave up drinking. She started working long days in construction. She checked in every year with immigration agents.

But in 2023, work dried up and she fell behind on rent. She felt her mental health slipping. She applied for a women's transitional housing program in Baltimore.

Pires thrived there. With no high school diploma and only second-grade reading skills, she qualified for a state-run job training course to polish and refinish floors. Photos show her smiling broadly in a blue graduation gown.

Friends say Pires may have a tough exterior, but she's known for thinking of others first. She often greets people with a cheerful question: ""How's your mental?"" It's her way of acknowledging that everyone carries some sort of burden.

""This is a person who just yearns for family,"" said Britney Jones, Pires' former roommate. ""She handles things with so much forgiveness and grace.""

The two were living together when Pires went to downtown Baltimore on March 6 for her annual immigration check-in. She never returned.

A crackdown on ""the worst of the worst""

When President Donald Trump campaigned for a second term, he doubled down on promises to carry out mass deportations. Within hours of taking office, he signed a series of executive orders, targeting what he called ""the worst of the worst"" — murderers, rapists, gang members. The goal, officials have said, is 1 million deportations a year.

In March, Pires showed up at the immigration office with paperwork listing all her check-ins over the past eight years. This time, instead of receiving another compliance report, she was immediately handcuffed and detained.

""The government failed her,"" attorney Jim Merklinger said. ""They allowed this to happen.""

Given that she was adopted into the country as a child, she shouldn't be punished for something that was out of her hands from the start, he said.

Her March arrest sparked a journey across America's immigration detention system. From Baltimore, she was sent to New Jersey and Louisiana before landing at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona.

She tried to stay positive. Although Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric made her nervous, Pires reminded herself that the system granted her leniency in the past. She told her friends back home not to worry.

A deportation priority

On June 2, in an email exchange obtained by AP, an ICE agent asked to have Pires prioritized for a deportation flight to Brazil leaving in four days.

""I would like to keep her as low profile as possible,"" the agent wrote.

Her lawyer tried to stop the deportation, calling Maryland politicians, ICE officials and Brazilian diplomats.

""This is a woman who followed all the rules,"" Merklinger said. ""This should not be happening.""

He received terrified calls from Pires, who was suddenly transferred to a detention facility near Alexandria, Louisiana, a common waypoint for deportation flights.

Finally, Pires said, she was handcuffed, shackled, put on a bus with dozens of other detainees, driven to the Alexandria airport and loaded onto an airplane. There was a large group of Brazilians on the flight, which was a relief, though she spoke hardly any Portuguese after so many years in the U.S.

""I was just praying to God,"" she said. ""Maybe this is his plan.""

After two stops to drop off other deportees, they arrived in the Brazilian port city of Fortaleza.

Starting from scratch back in Brazil

Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.

She has spent months there trying to get Brazilian identification documents. She began relearning Portuguese — listening to conversations around her and watching TV.

Most of her belongings are in a Baltimore storage unit, including DJ equipment and a tripod she used for recording videos — two of her passions.

In Brazil, she has almost nothing. She depends on the shelter for necessities such as soap and toothpaste. But she maintains a degree of hope.

""I've survived all these years,"" Pires said. ""I can survive again.""

She can't stop thinking about her birth family. Years ago, she got a tattoo of her mother's middle name. Now more than ever, she wants to know where she came from. ""I still have that hole in my heart,"" she said.

Above all, she hopes to return to America. Her attorney recently filed an application for citizenship. But federal officials say that's not happening.

""She was an enforcement priority because of her serial criminal record,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email. ""Criminals are not welcome in the U.S.""

Every morning, Pires wakes up and keeps trying to build a new life. She's applied for Brazilian work authorization, but getting a job will probably be difficult until her Portuguese improves. She's been researching language classes and using her limited vocabulary to communicate with other shelter residents.

In moments of optimism, she imagines herself working as a translator, earning a decent salary and renting a nice apartment.

She wonders if God's plan will ever become clear.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250911-maria-pires-mb-1430-968659.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:57.657550

Miller & Chevalier frequently advises clients on issues related to imports and tariffs, including on coordinating responses to the IEEPA Tariffs addressed in this article.","Introduction

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court agreed to expedited review of two appeals concerning the legality of the Trump administration's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including fentanyl and immigration-related tariffs on products of Canada, Mexico, and China (Trafficking Tariffs), and the reciprocal tariffs imposed on products of most countries (Reciprocal Tariffs) (together with the Trafficking Tariffs, the IEEPA Tariffs). Recent court decisions, including the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision finding that the IEEPA Tariffs exceeded the president's authority, represent a significant setback for the administration's efforts to use the executive's emergency power under IEEPA to impose tariffs.

Despite the Federal Circuit's decision, and similar holdings from the district courts, the IEEPA Tariffs remain in effect pending review by the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court overturns the lower court decisions on this issue, the IEEPA Tariffs will remain in effect. The Supreme Court could also remand without deciding whether the tariffs are legal, leaving the lower courts to continue addressing them on a case-by-case basis. Even if the IEEPA Tariffs are struck down by the Supreme Court, importers will face an uncertain timeline to recover funds already collected by the government. Importers therefore need to be proactive in preserving their rights while these cases are pending.

Importers should take steps to maximize their chance of obtaining tariff refunds. This includes closely monitoring the liquidation of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid, asking U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to extend the liquidation timeframe for those entries, and filing protests when the entries are liquidated.

What Tariffs Are at Issue?

The plaintiffs have sued President Trump and other administration officials in the Court of International Trade (CIT) and the District Court for the District of Columbia for improperly invoking IEEPA to impose tariffs on products from Mexico (Executive Orders (E.O.) 14194 and 14198), China (E.O.s 14195 and 14228), and Canada (E.O. 14197) based on presidential declarations of national emergencies concerning drug trafficking and migration (the aforementioned Trafficking Tariffs). The cases also challenge the universal reciprocal tariff program based on a presidential declaration of national emergency concerning the trade deficit (E.O. 14257) that imposed a baseline 10 percent tariff on most countries and the country-specific rates that followed (the aforementioned Reciprocal Tariffs). The pending litigation also addresses subsequent amendments to the IEEPA Tariffs programs under separate executive orders.

There are also several other recent tariff measures, including some levied under IEEPA, that have not been directly challenged under the current proceedings. These tariffs include the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, automobile parts, and copper, which were imposed under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and section 301 tariffs on certain China-origin goods imposed under the Trade Act of 1974.

Further, the plaintiffs in the proceedings before the courts have not explicitly challenged several tariffs issued under IEEPA, including the 40 percent tariff on Brazil-origin goods and the 25 percent tariff on India-origin goods. However, those tariffs are similarly at risk of being overturned if the Supreme Court determines that IEEPA does not authorize issuance of tariffs.

The table below lists all Trump administration tariffs in chronological order.

What Have Federal District Courts Said About IEEPA Tariffs?

Two district court decisions have addressed the legality of IEEPA tariffs.

First, in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00066 (Ct Int'l Trade, Apr. 14, 2025), the CIT held that IEEPA does not grant the president authority to ""impose unbounded tariffs"" (with respect to the Reciprocal Tariffs) or to impose tariffs on lawful imports in response to an unrelated trafficking and crime problem (with respect to the Trafficking Tariffs). The CIT ordered a universal, permanent injunction on the challenged tariffs, which was stayed by Federal Circuit during the government's appeal and remains stayed now as the case proceeds to the Supreme Court. The CIT's decision was recently upheld by the Federal Circuit in the V.O.S. Selections decision discussed below.

Second, a federal district court in Washington, DC, similarly held that the IEEPA Tariffs exceed the president's authority. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-1248 (RC), 2025 WL 1525376, at *6 (D.D.C. May 29, 2025), the court held that IEEPA does not grant the executive the authority to impose tariffs, and therefore, that the government's tariffs are in violation of the non-delegation doctrine and separation of powers, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) – a ruling that goes still further than the CIT in invalidating the IEEPA Tariffs. The district court also found that the CIT did not have jurisdiction to address the legality of the tariffs.

Both decisions are now on appeal and have been consolidated for joint review by the Supreme Court.

What Have the Courts of Appeals Decided?

On August 29, 2025, in a per curiam decision signed by seven of the 11 judges who heard the case, the Federal Circuit affirmed the CIT's decision while vacating the universal permanent injunction on the IEEPA Tariffs and remanded the case for further evaluation of whether a universal injunction is proper.

In upholding the CIT's decision striking down the IEEPA Tariffs, the panel emphasized that the power to levy taxes, including tariffs, is expressly delegated to Congress under Article 1 § 8 of the Constitution. Further, for much of the nation's history, statutory delegations of tariff authority to the president were highly limited, involving only the authority to reduce or increase tariff rates through international agreements, rather than the authority to create new tariffs from whole cloth.

Then, addressing the text of IEEPA, the panel noted that, although IEEPA ""bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, [] none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.""

In contrast, the panel noted that other trade laws that grant authority to issue tariffs have done so explicitly, in ""clear and precise terms."" And despite the fact that IEEPA was promulgated nearly 50 years ago, and has been invoked frequently by presidents, no past president has used IEEPA to impose tariffs on imports or adjust tariff rates. Taking these facts together, the panel explained that:

whenever Congress intends to delegate to the President the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an over-all structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs. This is no surprise, as the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution; when Congress delegates this power in the first instance, it does so clearly and unambiguously.

Because IEEPA has no such unambiguous delegation of authority, the court concluded that the administration's tariffs issued under IEEPA were contrary to statute, and as such, unlawful.

Notwithstanding this decision, the panel vacated the universal permanent injunction on enforcing IEEPA Tariffs that was ordered by the CIT, remanding the issue for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's June decision in Trump v. Casa. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that universal injunctions ""likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts."" The Federal Circuit therefore directed the district court to determine whether a universal injunction was permitted under the equitable principles addressed in Casa.

While joining in the majority decision, Judges Cunningham, Lourie, Reyna, and Stark also submitted an additional opinion stating their view that ""IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose any tariffs"" at all. The concurrence based this conclusion on the plain language of IEEPA, finding that any tariff issued by the president under IEEPA would exceed Congress's delegation of authority.

Finally, Judges Taranto, Prost, Chen, and Chief Judge Moore dissented, stating the view that ""IEEPA's language, as confirmed by its history, authorizes tariffs to regulate importation"" under statutorily defined conditions, including ""unusual and extraordinary threat, having foreign sources, to the national security or foreign policy or economy of the United States, the threat declared as a national emergency..."" According to the dissenting judges: ""IEEPA embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under non-emergency laws,"" and includes authority to issue tariffs like those in question here.

The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was set to hear oral arguments in Learning Resources on September 30, 2025. However, both plaintiffs and the government have agreed that the DC Circuit should hold the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court case.

What Are the Next Steps in the IEEPA Tariff Appeals?

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government's request for expedited review of the V.O.S Selections decision. The Supreme Court also consolidated the DC and Federal Circuit cases and set a deadline of October 30, 2025, for completion of all briefing. Oral argument is calendared the first week of November 2025 and a decision is likely to follow shortly thereafter. In light of this order, the Federal Circuit's ruling in V.O.S. Selections is stayed automatically. The DC Circuit is also likely to stay proceedings in Learning Resources.

Despite lower court orders finding the IEEPA tariffs unlawful, those tariffs will remain in effect until a final determination is reached. Further, as noted above, the appeal before the Supreme Court does not apply to tariffs issued under other laws, such as the 50 percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from other trading partners, which were issued under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

What Are Possible Outcomes to this Litigation?

There are several possible outcomes to the ongoing tariffs litigation, each with different implications for importers. Here are a few of the potential paths forward:

The Supreme Court could find that the IEEPA Tariffs are valid and imposed within the president's emergency authority under IEEPA. If it does, we expect the IEEPA Tariffs to continue under their existing parameters and importers will be required to pay these duties on all imports until the IEEPA Tariffs are lifted.

The Supreme Court could remand one or both cases without deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs challenged on appeal. Although IEEPA had never been used to impose tariffs before the current administration, the Supreme Court may find that IEEPA authorizes the executive to regulate trade by imposing tariffs, without deciding specifically whether the administration's tariffs are lawful. If it does so, the Supreme Court may use this opportunity to establish parameters that provide boundaries on the use of IEEPA's authority. These parameters could include, for example, being narrowly tailored to fit the stated emergency or further defining what qualifies as an ""usual and extraordinary threat."" With these guiderails in place, the Court could remand the issue to the lower courts to address whether the IEEPA Tariffs satisfy the criteria.

The Supreme Court could also avoid deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs altogether by deciding the case solely on a jurisdictional basis. The Supreme Court may find that the CIT holds exclusive jurisdiction (or conversely, that the DC district court has general jurisdiction) over the tariffs matter and remand these cases to the appropriate lower court without making a finding on the merits. This is a key point where the Federal and DC Circuits differed (and a key reason why the matters have been consolidated to appear together before the Supreme Court): The Federal Circuit determined that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction to review litigation related to the validity of tariffs, while the DC district court found that the CIT did not have any jurisdiction because the executive's powers under IEEPA did not include ""the power to tariff."" A jurisdictional ruling could side-step the merits of the IEEPA Tariffs but would have the effect of upholding the lower court's holding. From there, the lower court would have to determine the scope of equitable relief appropriate under the standard in Trump v. Casa.

The Supreme Court could hold that IEEPA does not grant the president the power to enact any tariffs. As noted above, the Federal Circuit held that only the tariffs specifically challenged in the V.O.S. Selections litigation were unlawful; however, the concurrence went further and held that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of any tariffs. If the Supreme Court follows the concurrence, CBP would be required to refund the IEEPA Tariffs and end further collections.

The government has argued that this outcome would impose an extraordinary burden. An order striking down the IEEPA Tariffs would also call into question the trade agreements made with other nations in response to the recently enacted tariffs, particularly the Reciprocal Tariffs. In an August 11, 2025, letter to the Federal Circuit, the government noted that ""[t]he President believes that our country would not be able to pay back the trillions of dollars that other countries have already committed to pay, which could lead to financial ruin,"" including ""a 1929-style result.""

The Supreme Court could hold that some (but not all) of the IEEPA Tariffs are illegal. There are several tariffs under consideration, and the Court may find that only certain tariffs – or certain elements of the IEEPA Tariffs – are valid under IEEPA. In that case, the remaining portions would be struck down, and the government would no longer have authority to collect tariffs outside those authorized by the Supreme Court's decision. CBP would also have to find a mechanism to refund previously collected, but now invalidated, tariffs.

If Plaintiffs Win On Appeal, Will Importers Be Able to Collect Refunds for Tariffs Already Paid?

If the Supreme Court finds that some or all of the IEEPA Tariffs were implemented unlawfully, the government will face demands to refund the IEEPA Tariffs that were already collected, which could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.

The government has argued that this outcome would create an extraordinary burden, but it has acknowledged that if the IEEPA Tariffs are overturned, the tariffs already paid would need to be returned. On September 7, 2025, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent agreed that ""[the Treasury] would have to refund roughly half the tariffs, which would be a major blow to the Treasury."" Bessent also stated that ""[i]f the court rules that way, we'll have no choice but to comply.""

However, there is significant uncertainty about how the government would implement such refunds, what procedural hurdles importers would face in claiming the funds they are owed, and how long it would take to receive any payments. Further, the Supreme Court's decision may not resolve the legality of all IEEPA Tariffs, leaving continued uncertainty about the payment obligations for any tariffs that remain in effect. In light of these factors, importers are advised to take steps to protect their ability to obtain tariff refunds.

How Can Importers Protect Their Ability to Recover Tariffs They Have Already Paid?

Given the myriad paths forward in the IEEPA Tariffs litigation, importers should consider taking steps to preserve their rights and ability to claim timely refunds.

Track entry liquidations. While Supreme Court review is pending, importers should ensure that they have an internal process to track the liquidation (i.e., the final calculation of duties) of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid. Importers are encouraged to maintain records of all documents associated with those entries, including entry summaries, commercial invoices, and proof of payments made to CBP.

Request extensions to pending liquidations. 19 U.S.C § 1504 requires CBP to liquidate entries within one year of the date of entry. However, under statute, this period can be extended by up to three years if an importer requests such an extension and shows good cause. An extension would give CBP additional time to apply the final legal outcome to the entries. It would also delay the start of 180-day statutory timeline to file protests on liquidated entries.

File protests if extensions are denied. Entries are typically liquidated 314 days from the date of entry. Because the tariffs were imposed earlier this year, most affected entries have not yet liquidated. When they do, and if extensions to pending liquidations are not granted, importers should consider filing protests to challenge CBP's liquidation of the entries. Importers should also consider requesting that the protest review be suspended until the IEEPA cases reach a final merits-based resolution.

If protests are denied, consider legal action. If the Supreme Court grants a favorable outcome, but does not establish a process for refunds, and protests are denied, then importers that have paid IEEPA Tariffs may consider filing their own lawsuits challenging the tariffs and seeking reimbursement. Pending the scope of relief resulting from this litigation, importers may want to keep an eye on class action lawsuits that potentially unfold that challenge the grounds of these IEEPA tariffs.

There are many possible paths forward and a decision by the Supreme Court may not be the final word in IEEPA Tariffs litigation. It is important that the import community closely follow the developments in this litigation and take action to preserve the ability to seek refunds if the IEEPA Tariffs are found to be unlawful.

“Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities.
With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families.
Below are statements from litigators: “Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU.
“Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”","SEATTLE – In a win for working families, a federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction effectively blocking an exclusionary directive of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS), which sought to shut out immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status for the first time in the program’s history since it was created in 1965. The ruling prevents the HHS directive from going into effect and enjoins the government from implementing or enforcing it against any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants, or other similar persons.

“This ruling is a powerful affirmation that every child, no matter their background or immigration status, deserves access to early education and support,” said Joel Ryan, executive director of theWashington State Head Start & Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program. “Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities. The court’s decision allows us to keep serving the children and families who need us most.”

“Today’s decision is a powerful step toward protecting access to early education and care for Head Start children and families all across the nation,” said Candice Williams, executive director of Family Forward Oregon. “This ruling ensures some stability for families and caregivers during a tumultuous time in our country. With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families. This is only one win of many to come! We will not stop fighting.”

The directive, which was issued this past July, aimed to reinterpret the definition of “federal public benefit” under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) to include Head Start — effectively making many immigrant children ineligible for the first time in the program’s history. This action has created confusion and fear among providers and families alike, leading young children to lose critical education.

In April, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, the ACLU of Washington, the ACLU of Illinois, the Impact Fund, filed a lawsuit on behalf of Parent Voices Oakland and Family Forward Oregon, and the Head Start Associations of Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

In July, plaintiffs sought emergency relief to stop HHS’ latest directive, which seeks to exclude many immigrant families from accessing early childhood education by restricting participation in Head Start based on immigration status.

Below are statements from litigators:

“Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU. “No child and no family should have to fear accessing critical early learning services, and we will continue to defend the families that Head Start aims to serve.”

“Our Constitution establishes a three-part system of government to make sure there are checks and balances on the power of any one branch to radically undermine American values and democracy,” said Lori Rifkin, litigation director at the Impact Fund. “Today, the court protected our democratic process by upholding the goals of Congress in establishing the Head Start program and rejecting the Trump Administration's illegal attempt to deny children crucial educational opportunities based on immigration status.”

“The court today protected the children and families that rely on Head Start across Washington state. Head Start programs provide crucial early learning support not only to the children and families that participate in them, but also entire communities facing barriers created by systemic inequality and racism,"" said Brent Low, ACLU of Washington staff attorney. “Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 16:57:48.935581

Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.
The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities.","When immigration agents went to a roofing job site this week in Rochester, New York, they were quickly met with a crowd of protesters who came out to defend workers who stayed on the roof of a home, according to officials and advocates at the scene.

A group of men were working on the roof of a private, multifamily house when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other federal law enforcement arrived midmorning Tuesday, according to a statement to NBC News from Democratic Assemblymember Jen Lunsford, who was at the scene and spoke to witnesses there.

A local resident saw what was happening and called a rapid response network, which alerted immigration advocacy groups, protesters, faith leaders and officials who arrived at the home, Lunsford said in the statement.

Rachel Barnhart, a Monroe County legislator, told NBC News that recently ICE has been “very active” in the Western New York region and taking workers into custody. But this was the first time that the local community was alerted in real time and more than 100 people, including Barnhart, were able to come out as the event was happening, she said.

“I saw two people sitting on the roof. It was frankly heartbreaking. The ICE agents were in the backyard, and in the front, a crowd was gathering,” she said. “People were displaying hand signs to the men. They were telling them to stay strong. It was a very peaceful crowd.”

One worker was arrested, but two other men remained on the roof as protesters gathered, according to Maria Garcia, the program director of the Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies, a nonprofit that supports farmworkers and migrant families.

Garcia said that with the permission of the homeowner, she went onto the roof to talk with the two men and offer to speak with ICE agents on their behalf. The coalition also provided them with water and snacks as they remained on the roof.

Garcia said immigration officials told her they did not have warrants for the business, property or individuals.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that on Tuesday it arrested Jacinto Mayancela Guallpa, an Ecuadorian immigrant who the agency said was in the country illegally.

As ICE was making the arrest, two others “fled up to a rooftop and refused to come down,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

McLaughlin said the men had confirmed to law enforcement that they did not have legal status to be in the U.S. She said an attorney for the men on the roof agreed to bring them to an ICE processing center later that day.

She described the crowd as “violent rioters” who “attempted to prevent law enforcement from exercising their sworn duties.”

“These dangerous rioters vandalized and slashed the tires of a border patrol vehicle. For their own safety, officers left the scene,” McLaughlin said.

She added that an attorney never showed up at the ICE office with the other workers. The department did not respond to a request for comment on whether the agents had a warrant.

As the immigration officials were leaving, it was discovered that someone had slashed the tires on a Border Patrol vehicle, Barnhart and others said.

Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.

Garcia and others disputed DHS’ claim that the protesters were violent. She said the crowd was simply exercising its First Amendment rights.

“People are just hurt. They’re angry. Families are being separated. Communities are being torn apart. It becomes personal,” she said. “So I can see why it could be misconstrued, but it was peaceful all around. It was a beautiful sight to see.”

Barnhart said the crowd was “very restrained” and “peaceful.”

“There were a lot of elected officials, there were a lot of pastors, a lot of elders in the community, a lot of neighbors, community leaders,” Barnhart said.

Lunsford said in her statement that she was told the man who was arrested had a valid work permit. She was told he has been in the U.S. for 25 years with no criminal history and has a family.

“When civil rights are indiscriminately violated, it is a threat to the rights of everyone, everywhere,” she said.

Barnhart said that “people felt jubilant that ICE left, but are still horrified at what’s going on in our country right now — mass deportations and the lack of due process.”

“At least in that case, the community was able to come together in a way that was really meaningful and show solidarity,” she said.

The Trump administration sued Rochester earlier this year over its sanctuary city policies. The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. It passed an updated resolution in 2017.

Rochester codified an expanded sanctuary city policy last month that also added protections for the LGBTQ community.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/25-826-ice-agent-ch-1117-b6bb08.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 16:57:54.666313

Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.The Arizona lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in their best interest.The Trump administration has argued it is acting in the best interest of the children by trying to reunite them with their families at the behest of the Guatemalan government. After Guatemalan officials toured U.S. detention facilities, the government said that it was ""very concerned"" and that it would take children who wanted to return voluntarily.Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July's arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico.

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Nearly all the children were in the custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Office of Refugee Resettlement and living at shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.

The Arizona lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in their best interest.

The Trump administration has argued it is acting in the best interest of the children by trying to reunite them with their families at the behest of the Guatemalan government. After Guatemalan officials toured U.S. detention facilities, the government said that it was ""very concerned"" and that it would take children who wanted to return voluntarily.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July's arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The arrest, which happened on July 15, took place outside the child’s preschool in South Beaverton, Oregon. The father, originally from Iran, is married to a U.S. citizen who said he has applied for a green card to remain in the United States legally, according to Oregon Public Media.

Randy Kornfield, who witnessed the arrest while taking his grandson to the same school, told a reporter it was “heartless” to arrest a father dropping his kid off. ICE said in a statement that the child was “unharmed.”

“These poor kids don’t know what’s going on,” Kornfield said at the time.

School principal Amy Lomanto witnessed the violent arrest and managed the school’s emergency response to the incident. The arrest has led to a decrease in attendance and “has shaken our community to the core,” according to a statement from the school and a complaint filed in federal court on September 10. Along with the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, two unions representing about 5 million educators, Lomanto is among the latest plaintiffs to join a lawsuit challenging immigration enforcement in spaces where safety is considered a sacred value, such as hospitals, houses of worships, and schools

Originally filed in April by a coalition of churches and community groups, the lawsuit challenges a Trump administration policy implemented in January that allows ICE agents to make arrests at school and churches, which were previously considered off limits. With students returning from summer break, educators and parents are calling on school boards to swiftly take steps to protect children and their families from ICE in and around schools as President Donald Trump’s accelerating mass deportation campaign spreads fear of racial profiling and state violence.

“By targeting schools, Donald Trump’s ICE is creating fear and chaos, and our students, their families and communities are paying the price for these traumatic and extreme immigration actions,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, in a statement on September 10. “We have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe.”

As the challenge makes its way through the legal system, education and racial justice advocates are searching for other ways to protect school communities from ICE. Leidy Robledo, a youth development specialist at the Alliance for Education Justice, said school leaders should demand that local police and city leaders do not work with ICE and provide staff with protocols and training for what to do if ICE agents show up at school. School officials and city leaders should also invest in counselors and after school programs for kids, not surveillance, punishment, and policing, Robledo said.

“ICE has been reported outside of schools, at bus stops, and in neighborhoods where children are walking to and from class,” Robledo said during a webinar on September 10. “For immigrant students, simply walking into school can feel like stepping into danger, and we believe that no young person should have to choose between their education and their family’s safety.”

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, issued a statement on September 9 accusing the media of “force-feeding” the public stories about children and parents being “scared to return to school” and claimed that ICE does not “raid or target schools.” The statement includes screengrabs from news reports about educators navigating fear of ICE among students and parents and preparing for potential encounters with immigration police as the new school year begins.

“ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. “Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

However, McLaughlin and DHS provided no evidence that “criminals” are using the nation’s schools as a hiding place. About 70 percent of the more than 61,000 people currently by ICE have no criminal convictions, and many others were convicted only of misdemeanors, including traffic tickets. While large-scale immigration raids have swept up people in public areas and adults at places of work, ICE is also arresting people at immigration hearings inside public buildings, and reports of ICE agents targeting parents dropping kids off at school and detaining high school students have sparked fear and confusion in communities across the country.

Students who are undocumented immigrants or live in mixed-status households are not the only youth impacted by the immigration crackdown. Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior attorney and director and of the Opportunity to Learn Program at Advancement Project, a civil rights group, said the Trump administration policies aimed at terrorizing immigrant families have made schools less safe for all students.

“The latest Supreme Court decision allows ICE to use racial profiling to violate the constitutional rights of Black and Latine Americans, disrupting the lives of immigrant families across the country when they should be celebrating their children at the start of the new school year,” Onyeka-Crawford said.

On September 8, the Supreme Court paused a ruling by a federal judge in Los Angeles that imposed restrictions on federal agents making immigration stops and arrests that plaintiffs and critics say amount to blatant racial profiling. The initial ruling was made on July 11 by a federal judge for the Central District of California, and barred ICE and Border Patrol agents from stopping people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are undocumented.

The judge ruled that “reasonable suspicion” cannot rest solely on any combination of four factors: “apparent race or ethnicity,” speaking in Spanish or accented English, being present at a location where immigrants “are known to gather” (such as Home Depot locations, where day laborers often come together and which have become noted areas for ICE raids), and working at specific jobs, such as landscaping or construction. The Supreme Court’s liberal justices dissented with the decision to overturn the lower court order. In a 21-page opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the decision as “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

Trump’s mass deportation campaign is a nationwide effort, but the administration has singled out Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other large cities with Democratic leadership for immigration sweeps and raids, which has sparked mass protests and community self-defense efforts.

As litigation over the administration’s crackdown continues, advocates say immigrants — and people who are perceived as immigrants — are at risk of being disappeared into remote immigration jails without due process, as viral videos of masked agents making violent arrests fuel fears. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus announced a new “Learning Without Fear” campaign on September 9, an effort to call attention to drops in school registration and attendance “caused by fear of irresponsible federal immigration enforcement.” The caucus announced the campaign on social media but did not elaborate on what it would accomplish. Research shows that anxiety and fear around immigration status fuels disparities in academic achievement among students who are undocumented or live with undocumented family members.

As a result of Trump’s crackdown, children are afraid to leave home, parents are making plans in case they are disappeared, and teachers across the country are adopting protocols in case of an encounter with ICE, according to Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigrant rights group America’s Voice.

“This is the high cost of Trump’s mass deportation agenda — not just economic devastation, but educational chaos and psychological scarring,” Cárdenas said in a statement on Wednesday. “The worst part? It’s by design.”

Robledo said educators are stepping up to the challenge, but they need support from school boards and local political leaders, who should loudly oppose cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement.

“If one [school] district can protect immigrant youth, all districts must,” Robledo said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2229329769-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:50.059917

On Friday, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.) introduced the Limiting ICE’s Nationwide Encroachment Act (LINE Act), which would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from sharing Medicaid records with immigration enforcement.

The bill explicitly bars the disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected through Medicaid enrollment — including home addresses and medical histories — to ICE or any other agency for immigration purposes.

Her colleague Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) rolled out the Home Together Act, which would prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from disclosing public housing records for immigration enforcement. The measure also prohibits HUD from compelling local housing authorities to share resident data and requires a public accounting of any prior disclosures to immigration officials.

The twin bills arrive just weeks after the Trump administration announced new interagency agreements giving DHS unprecedented access to personal data held by HHS, CMS, and HUD. Those agreements, according to administration officials, would allow ICE to identify undocumented residents by combing through benefits databases — a move Democrats blasted as a weaponization of the social safety net.

“These bills are about drawing a line in the sand,” Kamlager-Dove said at a press conference unveiling the legislation. “Trump wants to turn doctors, nurses, and housing officials into extensions of ICE. We’re saying no. Medicaid and housing assistance exist to help families survive, not to help deport them.”

Vargas underscored the risk to families already facing a housing crisis. “If immigrants fear their housing records could be weaponized against them, they will retreat into the shadows,” he said. “That makes our communities less safe, less stable, and more unequal.”

The administration’s moves have already sparked alarm among privacy advocates. A POLITICO investigation last month found that immigration enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping into massive personal data troves — while Congress has lagged on passing comprehensive data privacy laws.

Together, the LINE Act and Home Together Act reflect an emerging Democratic strategy to blunt Trump’s deportation campaign by choking off access to federal databases — a front line in what is quickly becoming Washington’s fiercest fight over data, privacy, and immigration enforcement.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grc7!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd501c058-323b-42d7-b201-67f9440dc44b_2560x1384.png",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:48.095749

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment via email Thursday afternoon.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump promised his administration would carry out the mass deportation of millions of illegal immigrants once he returned to the White House in January. While slow to begin with, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, gave a multi-billion-dollar boost to ICE's budget, providing funding for extra staff and detention capacity.

What To Know

ICE Flight Monitor said that between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the Trump administration carried out at least 7,454 enforcement flights, marking a 34 percent increase over the same period in 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office.

In August alone, there were 1,393 ICE flights, the data showed, with around 240 of those counted as removal, or deportation, flights out of the country. That number had only moved above 200 in May, when 209 were recorded.

The other flights included in the monitor's totals—gathered through independent tracking due to no official government data—are removal-related flights, meaning planes linking up deportation efforts, and domestic ""shuffles"", referring to ICE flights which move detainees between the agency's various detention centers.

More shuffle flights have been recorded under the Trump administration, likely due to a rapidly growing detention center line-up and a record number of ICE detainees.

Most of the flights leaving the U.S. were headed for Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, with nationals from those four countries making up some of the largest shares of known undocumented immigrants in the U.S. New destinations recorded under the second Trump administration included: Greece, Pakistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Chile, and Kazakhstan.

Human Rights First raised concerns about the conditions on board the planes, with many deportees held in handcuffs or shackles for the entire flight, which can stop off in multiple countries and last more than 30 hours.

The Trump administration has insisted that ICE detainees receive high standards of care, while also maintaining that those being deported have broken U.S. laws and must be sent home or to a third country.

What People Are Saying

Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First, in a press release: ""Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration's deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.""

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya, in a press release: ""U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.""

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official on the arrests of alleged illegal immigrants in late August: ""We've said it before, and we'll keep saying it: If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we WILL find you, arrest, you, and deport you. The days of letting dangerous criminals terrorize American citizens are over. President Trump and Secretary Noem will continue to do everything in their power to fulfill the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country.""

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Márquez in Tucson extended until at least Sept. 26 a temporary restraining issued over the Labor Day weekend. Márquez raised concern over whether the government had arranged for any of the children's parents or legal guardians in Guatemala to take custody of them.

Laura Belous, attorney for the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which represents the children, said in court that the minors had expressed no desire to be repatriated to their native countries of Guatemala and Honduras amid concerns they could face neglect, possible child trafficking or hardships associated with individual medical conditions.

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Denise Ann Faulk, an assistant U.S. attorney under the Trump administration, emphasized that the child repatriations were negotiated at high diplomatic levels and would avoid lengthy prohibitions on returning to the U.S.

Nearly all the children were in the custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement and living at shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.

The Trump administration’s latest ask of Congress called for a stopgap funding bill, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), to keep the lights on through January. But some Republicans worry the move would stick federal agencies with another year of flat funding.

“I just think that we get into January, get into the new year, that it’s less likely we’ll do any appropriation bills and we’ll have a yearlong CR,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a GOP spending cardinal, told The Hill on Tuesday.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who also serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday that while he recognizes Oct. 1 “is not a doable date” for appropriators to finish their annual funding work for fiscal 2026, he’s not “prepared to support a CR that’s a long-term extension.”

GOP appropriators in both chambers have been pushing for a stopgap to last through sometime in November, at the earliest, to keep pressure on lawmakers to finish their annual funding bills.

There’s also been bipartisan interest in using the coming deadline as pressure for lawmakers to hash out a bicameral funding deal that could allow Congress to approve three of its 12 annual funding bills by the end of the month and knocking out the rest with the stopgap.

“I don’t want to take the heat off of the Senate or the House and just getting our work done,” Rounds said. “And it’s a terrible thing to do to the Department of Defense to have continuing resolutions, which don’t allow us to actually move forward with some very critical new projects.”

Talking to reporters Tuesday, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who has pitched a stopgap through part of November, was noncommittal to reporters shortly after the White House’s request for a Jan. 31 deadline when pressed about the timeline Republicans might land on for a CR.

“I think that sentiment is probably still leaning toward something shorter, and that’s pretty much on both sides, and it’s basically with the idea to keep a sense of urgency,” he said, adding he thinks there’s some flexibility on the timeline.

“We’re not going to try to do something that Democrats are opposed to. We’re not trying to jam them here. We’re trying to work together with them,” he also said.

But there is growing appetite in the party’s right flank for another yearlong stopgap, similar to the outcome of Congress’s last shutdown fight in March, in a bid to reduce government spending, and they have expressed skepticism about ongoing efforts to pass fiscal 2026 funding bills in the coming weeks.

“If we want to do a very short CR into the middle of October to see if we can negotiate that minibus, that’s fine,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), a senior appropriator, said ahead of the White House’s request Tuesday. “But beyond that, I think you got to go into next year.”

He also expressed doubts about efforts for a bicameral deal on the full-year fiscal 2026 funding plan for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) — the bill crafted by the Appropriations subcommittee he chairs.

“If the purpose is to see if we can negotiate a successful minibus, but again, I’m skeptical about whether that can be done on the [agricultural funding bill], in terms of the level funding issue,” he said.

The bill is one of the three full-year funding plans that Republicans have been looking to pass as part of a minibus some are hopeful will ride alongside a stopgap this month. The two bills include annual funding plans for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the legislative branch operations.

This week, top Republicans pushed for what they’ve described as a “formal conference” to negotiate the funding bills. Cole also told reporters such a move would allow for more involvement from members.

“A formal one, everybody’s involved,” he said. “You get a much better reflection.”

“If you do an informal one, basically, it’s the subcommittee chairmen negotiating, the Big Four, sorting it out,” he said, referring to the four top funding negotiators in the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle. “I would prefer much more member involvement, and I know the Speaker would.”

Congress is facing a tight crunch on legislative time. Cole also acknowledged the timing constraints the Senate could face as part of the process.

“I don’t think that’s a reasonable possibility, because time,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator, told The Hill on Tuesday when asked about hopes of conferencing three funding bills to pass by the end of the month.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), the upper chamber’s funding chief overseeing USDA funding, said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing at the staff level in both chambers when asked about the chances of a bicameral deal on his subcommittee’s annual funding plan.

“Our staffs are working on it right now, OK, and trying to find out all the areas of agreement between our bill and theirs and any disagreement, and if we can include them, that’d be great.”

“But yeah, I think it’s going to be challenging,” he said.

With less than 20 days standing between Congress and the month’s end, tensions only seem to be rising.

In recent days, Democrats have warned their GOP colleagues not to expect a similar outcome for this month’s funding to what Washington witnessed in March — when Senate Democrats took a beating from their base for helping Republicans pass a GOP-crafted plan to keep the government open through early fall.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/moranjerry_050825gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:41.181235

The bill also would increase the maximum term of imprisonment from two to five years for repeated improper entry.

Illegal immigration makes it worse.
The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-vote majority but need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation.","The House passed a bill Thursday with some bipartisan support that would boost prison sentences for migrants convicted of repeatedly entering the United States illegally or entering the country and committing a felony.

Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in a 226-197 vote to pass the legislation, which is part of a wider tough-on-immigration push from President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers.

Among other changes, the bill would set a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years, and allow up to a life sentence, for migrants who either improperly enter or attempt to improperly enter the United States and then are convicted of a felony. The bill also would increase the maximum term of imprisonment from two to five years for repeated improper entry.

Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice, who sponsored the bill, issued a statement after the vote that the measure is necessary to respond to the immigration policies of former President Joe Biden, whom conservatives have criticized for allowing an influx of migrants into the United States.

“These individuals included people from countries designated as state sponsors of terror, with 400 illegal aliens on the Terrorist Watch List being encountered at the border,” Bice said. “We must deter future illegal immigration and give our law enforcement and border patrol officers the tools they need to remove dangerous criminals.”

All 11 Democrats who voted for the bill represent battleground seats and are Republican targets next year. They were Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas; Don Davis of North Carolina; Laura Gillen of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Vicente Gonzalez of Texas; Adam Gray of California; Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan; Frank J. Mrvan of Indiana; Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez of Washington; Tom Suozzi of New York; and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.

Democrats who opposed the measure said penalties are already in place for migrants who commit felonies in the United States and the legislation would bolster the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in floor remarks that migrants who enter the country and commit heinous crimes already face state penalties such as life in prison and the death penalty.

“I understand that it might be satisfying for us to say we’re just going to increase all these penalties, but we’re not in any way connecting with the worst of the worst,” Raskin said. “What are we really doing? We’re saying that we’re going to hold people who have done nothing other than enter the country illegally for much longer periods of time, for five or 10 years. And again, we see this as very wasteful in terms of public tax dollars.”

The bill also has provisions to increase prison sentences for migrants convicted of reentry after they have been removed multiple times from the United States, or who were convicted of crimes before their removal.

Rep. Brad Knott of North Carolina, a Republican and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in floor remarks that the legislation “profoundly enables law enforcement to protect us” from crimes perpetuated by those who enter the United States illegally.

“No matter the type or category, all crime is made worse by illegal immigration,” Knott said. “Theft, assault, murder, drug trafficking, human trafficking, violent crime, property crime, you name it. Illegal immigration makes it worse. What is perhaps most unfortunate is that many of the worst offenders in this specific category return to the United States after being deported due to gaps in the current immigration law.”

Knott, a former prosecutor, said he saw in that role that the deportation process alone was insufficient to stop migrants who seek to come into the United States for illegal purposes.

“I have investigated, tried and convicted many individuals who have been deported two times, three times, four times, and some even beyond 10 times, yet they continue to illegally return with the sole intent,” Knott said.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-vote majority but need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has introduced a companion bill, also known as Kate’s Law. That measure is named after Kate Steinle, who was killed in 2015 in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant with multiple prior deportations.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/09/house_votes_207_072325.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:45.934975

“This is fascism on display,” said Joe Harmon, a teacher who Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents arrested at the protest.

“This is fascism on display,” said Joe Harmon, a teacher who Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents arrested at the protest. “You have people, the most vulnerable people in our society, including a lot of my students, being affected by all the Trump nonsense. And these guys are here (National Guardsmen), willingly or not, defending it.”

According to Harmon, he was arrested for failing to comply with an order; an agent told him to move from a bollard on the sidewalk and he refused, remarking that it was a public sidewalk. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Unit responded by swarming Harmon, firing less-lethal rounds into the crowd as he fled.

The sound of projectile launchers and federal agents yelling conflicting orders disoriented the space. Protesters ran as rubber bullets flew by and pelted people on the head.

Kea Lane, who claims ICE is “kidnapping and disappearing” her community members, said this occurrence is common. Lane is an activist who routinely attends the 24-hour protest at the detention center.

“They target specific protesters they deem to be threats, regardless of what they’ve done. They make untruthful claims and charges against people,” Lane said.

Since June, DHS — with National Guardsmen on standby — has skirmished almost nightly with protesters outside the detention center, a migrant-holding facility, in response to mass deportation efforts in Los Angeles County.

In response, some protesters started Occupy ICE LA, a 24-hour protest collective set up across the street from the detention center, which documents and accosts DHS agents throughout the day.

Protesters haven’t left the encampment in weeks despite almost nightly skirmishes with DHS and multiple removals by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

According to LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, the LAPD doesn’t assist with immigration enforcement and hasn’t since 1979. In a June press statement, McDonnell reiterated the policy to “make it clear.”

Since then, the LAPD has regularly dispersed anti-ICE protests, including at ICE immigration raids. DHS started mass deportations sweeps in Los Angeles County by arresting 44 migrants on June 6; this was followed by additional raids targeting farm workers, day laborers and street vendors. ICE is also appearing at schools, churches, and mandated immigration check-ins at federal facilities.

Occupy ICE LA held a sit-in at City Hall at 4 p.m. before marching through downtown. Activists delivered speeches on the lawn regarding ICE, the Palestinian genocide in Gaza by Israel, as per the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the struggle of Indigenous people.

According to Trisden Shaw, a professor of ethnic studies at Santa Monica College, these topics are interlinked through colonialism. Shaw said the U.S. dominates the world through colonization, which is why the country is militarily involved in different places.

On the South Lawn, an activist who has been involved in the Abolish ICE movement since 2018 said during a speech, “I have never seen the amount of aggression that I’ve seen at these protests.” He called them “mercenaries” and demanded ICE to “get the fuck out of L.A.,” before telling the crowd they should be concerned.

“Even if you’re not directly affected by it, it is your problem. It’s your issue because this is more than just an immigration issue; this is a human rights issue,” he said. “People’s human rights are being violated left and right.” This protester was later arrested.

After the speeches, protesters spilled onto west First Street in front of the LAPD Headquarters. Protesters displayed their signs, waved flags and danced alongside the road.

People on motorcycles dashed around the street, performing burnouts and wheelies to a crowd of cheering protesters. Incoming traffic honked and drivers raised fists in solidarity as they drove by. Protesters chanted and marched towards the detention center around 7 p.m.

A few people banged, kicked, and rattled the newly installed black, metal, anti-climb fence at the detention center, but most just shouted from the street. One protester shot a firework, while another kicked the gate until it opened. People cheered and mocked as DHS approached, but most maintained their distance, and no one stepped onto federal property.

According to Shaw, “a peaceful protest can be deemed violent very quickly. Repressive and violent actions from police could spiral out of control quickly. Organizers have to ensure that people aren’t reacting, but human beings are human beings. One action is enough to deem it a violent protest; when that label comes, it opens the floodgates for tear gas, rubber bullets.”

A man holding a Mexican American flag helped close the gate. Then, a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, a hard plastic sphere filled with a chemical irritant that bursts on impact, into the fence, covering protesters in irritant.

Protesters fled, seeking cover, but they returned to the gate, yelling “peaceful protest.”

After a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, two protesters jumped on the fence, catching agents’ attention, and raised their middle fingers in opposition before spray-painting “Fuck ICE” under fire. Protesters threw water bottles from the crowd as pepper bullets exploded off the fence, with some pepper balls making it through and hitting non-protester cars idling in traffic.

DHS and ICE’s Special Response Team then moved onto the sidewalk to commence dispersal tactics on the other side of the fence. Most protesters retreated and journalists wearing “PRESS” markings moved forward, waiting for action. Before coming out, one federal agent stuck his arm out of the gate and pepper-sprayed the vicinity, including identifiable journalists.

Protesters threw stink bombs at the agents’ feet as they exploded out of the gate, ambushing people and shooting less-lethal rounds into the crowd.

“They were shooting at innocent protesters, innocent civilians, who came up to document them violently detaining and snatching people off the street,” Lane said. “This should be far past the point of alarming.”

Protesters managed to lift a fence panel off its hinges and lay it on the floor during a skirmish. A person with a megaphone then jumped on top of the panel and said, “Look at this shit, they couldn’t even get a better fucking fence.”

DHS and protesters skirmished for hours. Agents would explode out of the gate and swarm the crowd, tackling people and creating mass panic before retreating. Women with megaphones walked up to the DHS skirmish line and called agents “cowards,” “slave catchers,” and “human traffickers.”

LAPD arrived before 10 p.m. and declared an unlawful assembly. Officers set a perimeter on the intersection of North Alameda and East Aliso Street, then formed a rolling police line, carrying plastic handcuffs and 40-millimeter sponge round launchers. They pushed protesters towards East Temple Street, away from the detention center, shouting “move,” as they stepped in unison.

Protesters yelled, “You’re not supposed to be helping them,” “The bad guys are behind you,” and “Why don’t you care about them shooting us?”

LAPD officers shouted at protesters and threatened to arrest journalists for not complying with the dispersal order, despite a still-standing temporary restraining order (TRO) granting increased protections to journalists.

According to federal U.S. District Judge Hernan Vera’s order, “the likelihood of repeated confrontations” coupled with the LAPD’s “sustained pattern of conduct,” merited the TRO. LAPD can’t restrict journalists’ movement, shoot them with less-lethal weapons or obstruct, assault or arrest journalists during protests.

William Gude, known online as Film the Police LA, recorded an LAPD sergeant disregarding the TRO. Gude later identified the sergeant as Jose L. Vazquez from the Hollenbeck Division after he refused to identify himself and didn’t have it displayed on his helmet.

Gude reminded Vazquez of the court exemptions for journalists. Vazquez said, “It doesn’t matter right now,” and threatened to arrest Gude.

The confrontation caught the attention of an LAPD captain, who corrected Vazquez after he refused to let Gude talk to a superior officer.

“You’re absolutely right,” the captain said to Gude. Vazquez protested before waving off the captain and walking away.

Most protesters left around 10 p.m., but some people stayed across the street. Both parties stood still, facing off on different street corners. And in quick, random bursts, a dozen officers sprinted across the corner and arrested people.

In one instance, police chased a man who evaded them. While returning, an officer found an older woman huddled in a dark alleyway. Officers swarmed and arrested her. They later arrested another protester who smiled and laughed as LAPD officers escorted him away.

According to the LAPD’s Central Division X account, the LAPD arrested eight people for “various offenses,” and no one was injured during the unlawful assembly. LAPD and the officials at the detention center declined the Corsair’s request for comment.

The freedom of protest is the right to assembly and petition. These are guaranteed protections under the First Amendment in the United States, but it “Doesn’t always play out that way,” according to Shaw. Sometimes protesters don’t get what they want.

As of August 2025, ICE Flight Monitor is officially housed at HRF.","Washington, D.C. — A new report released today by ICE Flight Monitor, housed at Human Rights First, reveals that August 2025 marked a record-high number of U.S. immigration enforcement flights, underscoring the unprecedented scale and intensity of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.

The latest report documents at least 1,393 immigration enforcement flights in August alone—an average of 45 flights every day—the highest monthly total ever recorded since tracking began in 2020. In total, between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the administration carried out at least 7,454 flights, a 34 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.

“These numbers are absolutely staggering and deeply concerning in light of their connection to the increased arrests, detentions, and removals of people in our communities,” said Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First. “Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration’s deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.”

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya added, “In the face of escalating harms perpetrated against immigrants throughout the United States, ICE Flight Monitor is an essential tool for transparency and holding our government to account. U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.”

Additional key findings in the August report, include:

Increase in Removal Flights: At least 240 removal flights took place in August 2025, driven largely by an increase in flights to Mexico. The Trump administration has now carried out at least 1,279 removal flights since returning to office—20 percent more than during the same period last year.

New Destinations and Increased Multi-Country Flights: The Trump administration has sent removal flights to at least 66 countries, including first-time flights to Greece, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. It also expanded multi-country flights, where people remain shackled for days across multiple stops.

Third Country Transfers: In August, ICE Flight Monitor tracked the first deportation flight to Rwanda under a newly established U.S.–Rwanda agreement, part of a broader expansion of third-country removals.

Increased Domestic Transfer Flights: The administration conducted at least 805 domestic detention transfer flights in August 2025 alone, including 81 flights to offshore detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, where individuals are held in isolated detention facilities on the military base.

The report warns that these practices, many of which federal courts have already deemed unlawful, not only endanger vulnerable people but also erode democratic accountability.

CoreCivic Inc. said late Wednesday that it has begun receiving detainees at the West Tennessee Detention Facility in the rural town of Mason, located about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Memphis.

The arrivals come after Mason officials approved agreements with ICE and CoreCivic on Aug. 12, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.

For years, the prison served as an important economic engine for Mason. It was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with certain detention facilities. President Donald Trump reversed that order in January.

The contracts were approved amid a push by Trump for mass deportations of immigrants. Trump has touted a detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where allegations of mistreatment of detainees have drawn lawsuits from civil rights advocates and environmental groups.

Opponents of the Tennessee detention center, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, have expressed concerns that detainees could be subjected to abuse and neglect.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman has said the ICE facility will bring jobs and economic development to the town, which has struggled with financial problems and needs infrastructure improvements.

The ICE facility is expected to create nearly 240 new jobs, including positions for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour, according to CoreCivic. The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 in an annual fee for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company has said.

In 2022, Mason reached a deal with the state of Tennessee after it attempted to take over the city’s finances following years of alleged mismanagement. Some members of the public who spoke at the August meeting said Mason is a majority-Black town with a history of being ignored and treated with disrespect.

Tennessee’s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $44.7 million across four prisons for violations from 2022 through February, including for understaffing. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment — including at least 22 inmate deaths — at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.

The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement.","Three months after the Trump administration first sent troops to Los Angeles, a federal judge ruled that their National Guard deployment was illegal. As President Trump considers extending the federal takeover of Washington D.C. and ordering troops to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, LA residents are still recovering from the public safety, economic, and social impacts of this deployment – illustrating what may be in store for other major U.S. cities soon.

Why did Trump send troops to LA?

This spring, federal immigration enforcement in the LA region skyrocketed, with immigration arrests quadrupling between April and June. Immigrants without criminal convictions made up an increasing share of monthly arrests, jumping from 35 to 69% and challenging the Trump administration’s claims of targeting criminals for deportation. Evidence of racial profiling by federal immigration officers in LA initially resulted in a court order barring them from stopping someone based solely on race, language, job, or location, which the U.S. Supreme Court later overruled.

In early June, protests emerged in pockets of LA, following weeks of escalating immigration raids across the city, reports of inhumane detention conditions, and racial profiling concerns. Local officials, responding to isolated clashes between local law enforcement and some protestors, issued overnight curfews in downtown LA as they worked to lower tensions. Over objections from local and state leaders, President Trump then deployed 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property from protestors.

How did troops impact public safety?

By August, the Trump administration removed all but 250 troops from LA, claiming victory and restored public safety. The operation resulted in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charging just 26 individuals for crimes relating to protests over immigration raids. Notably, DOJ prosecutors dismissed eight of these charges shortly after filing, five because of false statements made by U.S. immigration officials. As the dust settles, it’s also clearer how this deployment posed its own threats to public safety, both during the protests and beyond.

From the start, state and local officials in California pushed back against the deployment as unnecessary and inflammatory. Even at the height of the protests, LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell insisted that, “We’re nowhere near a level where we would be reaching out to the governor for the National Guard.”

It marked the first time since the 1960s that the National Guard was deployed without a governor’s consent. Governor Gavin Newsom later sued the Trump administration, claiming in separate filings that the deployment unlawfully bypassed the governor’s permission and violated federal law by using troops for civilian law enforcement. Critics of the deployment emphasized it undermined public safety by escalating local tensions, diverting National Guard resources from critical work, including counterdrug operations, intimidating communities, and eroding public trust in the U.S. military.

Records disclosed in court unveiled that U.S. military leaders shared major concerns about this deployment and questioned whether troops were adequately trained for a domestic operation. They noted the operation could spur new protests, posing a significant risk to both LA residents and troops. National Guard members themselves also voiced concerns about being sent to LA with reports of decreased troop morale, amid a lack of work to do, and concerns over how the deployment could hurt military recruitment efforts for the next several years.

Who bears the costs of this deployment?

The U.S. Department of Defense initially estimated that the deployments would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $134 million. The operation’s exact costs remain undisclosed, with requests pending from California’s U.S. senators and governor to the federal government to get a more accurate picture of official expenses. In the meantime, Governor Newson’s office produced their own estimates, reporting $120 million in deployment costs so far.

This price tag for American taxpayers, however, is only a fraction of the full costs of the deployment.

In California, residents shoulder additional economic and social impacts, between the increase in immigration enforcement actions and the military deployment. Small businesses throughout LA are hurting from steep declines in foot traffic and sales. Employees weigh the risks of showing up to work, student attendance is in decline, and healthcare visits by immigrant patients have dropped off. The vibrancy of the city has become duller this summer, as communities are gripped by fear.

What comes next?

From the original 4,100 troops, now 250 National Guard troops remain in LA as the state’s lawsuit against the deployment continues. The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement.

Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement.","On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court stayed a district court injunction that had found Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents violated the Fourth Amendment by relying solely on an individual’s race and ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, location (such as a car wash or bus stop), and type of work as grounds for immigration arrests. The reversal permits ICE agents, at least in Los Angeles, to treat these factors as sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion of unlawful status.

In the sole concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh characterized the encounters with ICE as “brief investigative stops” during which agents “promptly let the individual go” if they learn that the individual being questioned is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the country. This account is inconsistent with the increasing incidents of ICE agents violently detaining and arresting U.S. citizens, at times resulting in their wrongful detention for weeks. And while Kavanaugh’s opinion suggests that remedies remain available for any Fourth Amendment violations that occur during these raids, in practice, ICE agents and the agencies that oversee them remain largely insulated from legal accountability.

Federal agents, however, are not operating alone. While ICE is bolstering its reach with a recently expanded budget, it still lacks the capacity to achieve Trump’s goal of 1,000,000 ICE deportations in his first year. Given this, the administration has enlisted the help of sheriffs across the country by reimplementing the 287(g) Task Force Model (TFM) program—which authorizes local law enforcement officers to function as federal immigration agents—for the first time since it was disbanded for violation of civil rights in 2012.

Unlike ICE, these local agencies are not immune from liability. The return of the 287(g) TFM opens a critical legal avenue for civil suits against sheriffs and municipalities whose officers violate the law, serving as a method of recourse for individuals and a necessary check against potential overreach by the Trump administration.

The 287(g) Program

The 287(g) program was created in 1996 through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA), an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It was designed to provide ICE with a “force multiplier” by permitting state and local police to assist in immigration enforcement. More specifically, it allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into formal agreements with state and local agencies, which deputize officers to carry out certain immigration enforcement functions, including interrogating individuals about their immigration status, issuing detainers, and initiating removal proceedings.

Initially, the program operated through three models: the Jail Enforcement Model (JEM), the Task Force Model (TFM), and the Hybrid Model (HM). The JEM permits law enforcement to interrogate and assist in the removal of noncitizens already in federal custody. The TFM, in turn, allows officers to proactively identify, question, detain, and arrest individuals based on suspected immigration violations during patrols in the community. And the HM gave officers the authority to perform immigration enforcement duties under the JEM and TFM. The government terminated the TFM in 2012 for civil rights violations but continued the JEM. The fundamental civil rights issue with the TFM is its structure: Officers are instructed to seek out noncitizens, but unlike criminal behavior, immigration status is not readily observable. Without clear markers of legal status, race can easily act as a proxy for suspicion of legal status. Officers who carry out the TFM, like all other officers, cannot use race as the sole factor to stop and question an individual. They are bound by federal, state, and local laws that stipulate that “reasonable suspicion,” required for detainment, cannot be built solely on race.

Later, in 2019, the government introduced the new Warrant Service Officer Model (WSOM), which allows local officers to execute ICE immigration warrants on already incarcerated individuals. Despite civil rights concerns, days after beginning his second term, President Trump reinstated the TFM in its original form, reigniting civil rights concerns that led to its previous termination. Unlike the other 287(g) models, the TFM allows local officers to initiate immigration enforcement during routine patrols, absent an ICE warrant or underlying criminal custody. This degree of discretion heightens the potential for racial profiling and other forms of unlawful detainment or imprisonment.

A History of the Program’s Civil Rights Violations

Various Department of Justice investigations have documented patterns of civil rights abuse by sheriff’s offices that implemented the TFM. For example, a 2011 Justice Department investigation concluded that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona “engaged in a pattern or practice of misconduct that violated the Constitution and federal law” in its execution of the 287(g) task force. This included sending dozens of officers to predominantly Latino neighborhoods to make minor traffic stops with the ultimate goal of questioning individuals’ legal status and turning them over to ICE (resulting in a 9-to-1 racial disparity in traffic stops). In a separate 2012 investigation, the Justice Department found similar violations in Alamance County, North Carolina. There, investigators determined that sheriff’s deputies were instructed to “go hunting” for Latino individuals and to set up checkpoints in front of Latino churches and businesses. As a result of these findings, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreements with both counties.

Oversight Challenges

The risk of civil rights violations is compounded by the lack of proper training and oversight, as documented by governmental oversight agencies. A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report criticized ICE for failing to articulate goals for the program and how local partners were to use their 287(g) authority. Deputized officers did not receive adequate training, and ICE failed to evaluate whether participating agencies complied with the agreements.

A 2010 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that ICE and its local law enforcement partners had not complied with the terms of their 287(g) agreements. It determined that the standards by which deputized officers were assessed contradicted the stated objectives of the 287(g) program, that the program was poorly supervised by ICE, and that additional oversight was necessary.

Following the 2009 GAO report, the Department of Homeland Security established an advisory board to evaluate agency applicants and vote on whether they should be accepted. This board included a representative from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties who monitored and advised agencies’ histories of civil rights abuses, acting as a safeguard against partnerships with those that had poor records. President Trump dissolved this board in early 2025, clearing the path for all law enforcement agencies, regardless of patterns of misconduct, to enter into an agreement.

Even as the TFM remained inactive for over a decade, the JEM and WSOM continued to suffer from inadequate oversight. A 2018 OIG report found that ICE was not ensuring that deputized officers completed required training. A 2021 GAO report found that ICE had failed to establish performance goals for the JEM and WSO 287(g) program. As of June 2025, ICE has not taken actions necessary to satisfy the recommendations from GAO, raising red flags about its ability to manage a more expansive, field-based enforcement model such as the TFM.

Additionally, while deputized TFM officers are currently required to undergo four weeks of training before going out into the field, “border czar” Tom Homan announced in February that he intends to cut the training period down to about one week.

Recourse Under 287(g) Task Force

Typically, there is little or no recourse for individuals whose rights are violated by immigration officials. Patrolling for illegal immigrants has historically been carried out by federal officers, including ICE. The Supreme Court, in its 1971 Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents decision, recognized an implied cause of action against federal officers for damages arising from the Constitution, terming it a “Bivens action.” In 1980, the Court stopped extending the theory to new factual scenarios, and since 1983, the Court has retreated from the theory altogether. In 2017, the Court narrowed the scope of Bivens claims to cases that have the same facts as prior cases and that do not involve any special factors that were not present in those prior cases. In the 2022 case Egbert v. Boule, the Court collapsed this new test into one question: “whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy.” As a result, under current law, individuals who violate constitutional rights while acting under federal authority are effectively immune from civil liability.

The reimplementation of the 287(g) TFM may open the gates to new remedies against illegal immigration enforcement actions. While the individual deputized officers are “considered to be acting under color of federal authority for purposes of determining the liability, and immunity from suit,” the local agencies and municipalities that oversee deputized officers are not afforded the same protections. By entering these agreements, sheriffs, counties, and municipalities may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state and local officials for constitutional violations, when the plaintiffs’ injuries stem from policies or customs of the law enforcement agency. They may also face liability under state tort law. Many states have tort frameworks that mirror § 1983, allowing broad liability for agencies or municipalities. Some state constitutions protect rights beyond those recognized by the U.S. Constitution, thereby expanding the scope of actionable claims. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2020 that the state constitution requires a warrant for persistent surveillance outside a home using a pole camera, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has found such surveillance permissible under the federal Constitution. Additionally, in 2017, the Iowa State Supreme Court ruled that an officer must terminate a valid traffic stop when the underlying suspicion is no longer present, and cannot go on to demand identification. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has determined that officers can check identification even when the suspicion for the stop has dissipated so long as it does not measurably extend the stop’s duration.

The legality of suing local agencies and municipalities for TFM actions is evidenced by the litigation against the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, which ultimately cost the county over $300 million in settlements. Even the more restrained JEM and WSOM have produced costly lawsuits for municipalities and sheriff’s departments. Those that have paid plaintiffs for civil rights abuses in the past several years include the Monroe County sheriff, El Paso County, San Juan County, Los Angeles County, Plymouth County, Henrico County, Nobles County, Allegheny County, Lehigh County, Bexar County, and Arapahoe County. This year, a federal judge ruled that Suffolk County could be held liable for up to $60 million in damages for officers’ execution of unlawful immigration detainers, and another judge found that Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay violated a U.S. citizen’s rights by holding him on an ICE detainer.

Lawsuits can act as a deterrent to police departments’ participation in the 287(g) TFM through two primary and interrelated mechanisms: financial consequences and public pressure. Police agencies generally have the choice to enter into these agreements, and when the cost is too high, they may choose to opt out entirely or adopt stricter policies and training to ensure that their officers will not violate constitutional norms.

Municipalities nationwide generally purchase insurance to indemnify themselves against liability for the acts of their law enforcement officers. These insurance policies shield them from financial responsibility in civil lawsuits. Because insurers control both the availability and the cost of coverage, they hold significant influence over police department practices. Insurance companies frequently leverage this power by requiring policy or procedural changes when they identify patterns of risk. Following high numbers of civil rights lawsuits, insurers typically raise their rates, demand changes in law enforcement personnel and policies as a condition of continued coverage, and, in some cases, remove coverage altogether. If the TFM model produces a surge in lawsuits, insurers are likely to respond with a demand in policy shift, induce higher rates, or reduce coverage, all of which may prompt agencies to reconsider their participation in the program.

Publicized incidents of civil rights violations have led to political pressure prompting sheriffs to leave the 287(g) agreement or be ousted at the ballot box. For example, Plymouth County (Massachusetts) Sheriff Joseph McDonald chose not to renew his office’s 287(g) agreement in 2020 following a suit from a coalition of civil rights groups. Donnie Harrison—who served as the sheriff for Wake County, North Carolina, from 2002 to2018, and first implemented the 287(g) program in 2007—lost his 2018 bid for reelection after his support for the WSOM and JEM became a focal point of the race. Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement. What’s more, Joe Arpaio was Maricopa County’s longest serving sheriff. He was ousted in 2016 by a Democratic challenger following the numerous lawsuits against the department for violations of civil rights in its implementation of the 287(g) program, both when it had 287(g) authority and after Homeland Security ended their agreement. The following year, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for violating a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos in traffic stops while he was sheriff.

When the TFM was first suspended in 2012, only 27 law enforcement agencies had active agreements with Homeland Security. As of July, that number has increased to an unprecedented 473 with an additional 12 pending agreements. To meet President Trump’s ambitious deportation goals, even more local agencies will likely need to join.

While the reinstatement and expansion of the program, with its history of abuse and minimal oversight, raises the danger of widespread rights violations, it also provides a novel avenue for accountability. Pursuing civil lawsuits against rights violations by local law enforcement will act as a safeguard against unlawful immigration enforcement practices and ensure the protection of civil liberties.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-11 14:57:10.262674

In July, Attorney General Ellison joined 20 other attorneys general in challenging the federal government’s reinterpretation of a decades-old law governing access to social services. A federal court granted the coalition’s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking sweeping new rules that threatened to strip funding from programs like Head Start, Title X family planning clinics, food banks, domestic violence shelters, adult education, and community health centers.

""Cutting off essential social services to people who cannot prove their immigration status is cruel and would have caused immense harm to folks across Minnesota, including kids from low-income families,” said Attorney General Ellison. “It is morally wrong to turn a child away from a food bank because of their family’s immigration status, and I’m pleased to have stopped the Trump Administration from doing exactly that. I don’t believe in the politics of division and cruelty, and most Minnesotans don’t either. We’re a state that believes in helping one another and treating others with respect, and that’s exactly what I will continue fighting for as your attorney general.”

Earlier this summer, four federal agencies – the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (ED), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) – issued a coordinated set of directives abruptly redefining longstanding policy under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). For nearly 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike interpreted PRWORA to allow states to offer vital public health, education, and anti-poverty programs regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration’s sudden reversal would have forced states to impose immigration status verification on countless services, threatening catastrophic funding losses and program closures.

The court’s decision halts implementation of those new directives in the plaintiff states while litigation proceeds, ensuring that millions of families can continue to access critical services without fear of denial or disruption. With this ruling, the judge is acknowledging that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by issuing sweeping new mandates without lawful rulemaking, grossly misreading PRWORA, and failing to consider the devastating impacts on states and communities.

In Minnesota, the changes to social services were expected to affect a variety of programs. One of the most prominent is Head Start, an early education program for low-income families that provides comprehensive services ranging from school readiness to parental engagement to nutrition and more. Another of the programs expected to be targeted funds the operation of shelters for homeless individuals, provides services for residents of those shelters, rapidly re-houses families to prevent them from becoming homeless, and more. Delivery time for some of these services, like emergency shelter during life-threatening weather conditions, can make the difference between life and death. Delaying these services to verify immigration status could have a devastating impact on recipients. Furthermore, given the transient nature of homelessness, many of the individuals served by this particular program do not have documentation of any kind.

Below the fold, I walk through Kavanaugh’s concurrence one argument at a time—in an effort to show exactly how he ends up in such a radically different place from both the district court and the unanimous court of appeals panel, albeit without making any effort to explain why those four judges were (all) wrong. Some of it is because of slipperiness with the facts; some of it is because of slipperiness with the relevant precedents. Some of it is because Kavanaugh seems to think things are true doctrinally that (in some cases, thanks to him), just aren’t.

To be sure, there are far more overt ways in which the justices have shown disrespect toward lower courts in their recent spate of rulings on Trump-related emergency applications. But just because this one is more subtle doesn’t make it any less serious—or any more defensible.

California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision Wednesday by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling Wednesday, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of Wednesday’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

The Ninth Circuit's decision has no practical effect at the moment, however, because the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the March 2025 order and that stay remains in effect.

In a new twist, on September 5, 2025, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that DHS' revocation of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation, and a partial revocation of a TPS designation for Haiti, violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Venezuelan and Haitian TPS beneficiaries cannot celebrate yet, however. DHS immediately moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district court has not decided. If the district court declines to issue a stay, DHS can try in the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Although it does not appear to have done so yet, DHS may also argue that because the judgment does not grant injunctive relief, then it cannot be enforced for thirty days pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(a).

To put it simply, TPS remains in flux and there is no certainty yet where things will land. Of note as of September 9th, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not updated its TPS webpage, but we believe that pursuant to the Federal Register notice, certain TPS Venezuela EADs have been automatically extended until November 7, 2025.

President Trump on Tuesday appeared to backtrack on sending in troops to Chicago.

""We're going to be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly,"" he said after dining at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. ""We're working it out with the governor of a certain state that would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city in that same state would love us to be there. We'll announce it probably tomorrow, and it's going to be something where we'll do like we did here.""

The federal government's 30-day takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., expires Wednesday, although the D.C. National Guard will remain posted throughout the district.

With the president suggesting another city could see a National Guard instead, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's sources inside the White House have signaled Chicago might no longer be the primary focus of the Trump administration's National Guard effort.

""They're not calling us now, which I think is a good sign. It is a sign that they are not hearing things that are suspiciously like we're going to see military troops coming,"" Pritzker said. ""I take it that the silence of the last day or two from those folks is an indication that maybe there's some other place or other focus that the president is putting his attention.""

Pritzker said it's a good sign a troop deployment isn't imminent in Chicago, but stressed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts in Chicago are just getting started, with agents netting more than a dozen arrests in recent days.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security touted the arrests of 13 people as part of ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

""In just the last few days in Chicago, ICE has arrested pedophiles, rapists, abusers, armed robbers, and other violent thugs,"" Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the federal government still has not provided any official communication with the city on their immigration crackdown in Chicago.

""Nothing has been communicated with us, and that's what the problem has been,"" he said.

Johnson said the rollout of a new website will be coming soon to help anyone in Chicago feeling under pressure by ICE raids.

In Pilsen, box trucks have been spotted with large video boards displaying scrolling ""know your rights"" messages to equip residents with information in case ICE knocks on their door.

Illinois leaders said they're hopeful the president's threatened National Guard rollout has been delayed or canceled, while reiterating the ICE efforts are just getting going.

""They clearly have not gone out in full force yet here, with seemingly the number of people from ICE that they intended to have on the ground working. We haven't seen all of those folks yet, but I anticipate that we will,"" Pritzker said.

Pritzker said, to his knowledge, approximately 200 ICE agents and 100 ICE vehicles have been deployed in and around Chicago in recent days.

As President Trump’s immigration crackdown intensifies, many immigrants who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years are getting snatched by masked agents and disappeared into a vast network of jails across the country.

In Vermont, a small but growing group of young attorneys have thrown themselves into the fight to defend the immigrants’ rights. Newly minted lawyers, including recent graduates of Vermont Law and Graduate School, are now going head to head with lawyers from Trump’s Justice Department.

The attorneys have been going into Vermont’s jails and encountering terrified immigrants, many of whom are being repeatedly shuffled between states in what appears to be a deliberate effort to frustrate their attempts to obtain effective legal representation. Some detainees do not even know where they are.

Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP), headed by immigration attorney Jill Martin Diaz, has been a driving force behind the effort to mobilize lawyers and defend immigrants. VAAP has grown from one staff member in 2024 to what will be a staff of eight by November, including four new attorneys who are part of the national Immigrant Justice Corps. VAAP recently received a $100,000 grant from the recently established Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to hire staff, bring in attorneys and train Vermont lawyers to handle immigration cases.

Martin Diaz formerly taught immigration law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, directed its Center for Justice Reform Clinic and practiced at Vermont Legal Aid. They currently are a lecturer in the department of social work at the University of Vermont. In 2023, Martin Diaz was named by the LGBTQ+ Bar Association as one of the 40 best LGBTQ+ lawyers under 40.

I visited VAAP’s headquarters in Burlington, where I interviewed Martin Diaz, staff attorney Leah Brenner and volunteer staff attorney Andy Pelcher.

“I’m looking around at our office that’s not even unpacked and we barely have lights and WiFi. How are we holding our own against Trump’s Department of Justice that just got a big, beautiful raise?” marveled Martin Diaz, who described fighting the Trump administration as akin to David vs. Goliath.

Martin Diaz said that immigrants are “canaries in the coal mine.”

“People are really starting to look at what’s going on in the immigration system as a microcosm for what could happen to our democracy if left unchecked, not just for noncitizens, but for everyone.”

Pelcher, who graduated Vermont Law and Graduate School in 2018 and went on to get an LLM, or master of laws, described a recent visit to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he encountered a Palestinian man who was a survivor of torture who “had been bounced around to a number of facilities during the 14 months that he had been detained.” Somehow he landed in a Vermont jail.

“People are being frequently transferred from facility to facility, seemingly as a means to deny access to counsel, family, local networks of support, and any other means by which these individuals can meaningfully prepare for their defense against removal,” said Pelcher. VAAP, together with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, took on the man’s case.

VAAP’s experience finding and aiding immigrants in Vermont’s jails has led Martin Diaz to oppose the idea of closing Vermont’s jails to ICE. “I would not advocate for more beds, but I would also strongly caution against a wholesale end to ICE’s ability to detain people in our state,” they said. “The truth is that there is no substitute for lawyers getting in their cars, going to a facility with our bodies and meeting one on one in private with our clients directly.”

“It’s really, really difficult to provide people with legal help telephonically, when the people who have your clients in custody have no respect for the rule of law and for individuals rights.”

Is America’s legal system up to the task of defending rights and institutions in the Trump era?

“I do have hope that the rule of law will prevail and that this horrible, horrible, tragic moment in our history, this painful moment for our community members who are being directly impacted, can also be a galvanizing opportunity for us to rethink what do we want our laws to say? What do we want due process to look like? What checks and balances do we want?” said Martin Diaz.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jill-martin-diaz-3-20250827.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:57:16.027806

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

Cell phone video obtained by News 8 Wednesday shows Maria Garcia, program director of the Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies, questioning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents about whether they had a warrant.

“I need a warrant for the property, the business or them,” Garcia is heard telling an agent. “Which one do you have?”

Garcia said she was permitted to climb to the roof where the workers had taken refuge. She had them sign legal representation forms, allowing her to communicate with federal agents on their behalf. Garcia noted the men, who were hired for a contracted job at the home, did not speak English but were able to communicate with her in Spanish.

She told News 8 that her focus was on the workers’ safety, with the men perched on the roof while tensions grew below.

“The purpose of us being there was for these workers,” Garcia said. “If everyone downstairs is panicking, they see people panicking … there was no one to catch them, there was no safety plan for them.”

As protesters gathered nearby with signs reading “Keep ICE out of Rochester,” Garcia said she worked to steer the crowd away from direct confrontation with law enforcement.

At one point, a Border Patrol van was seen with flat tires. It remains unclear how the damage occurred, but agents were later observed leaving in the vehicle.

Garcia said vandalism complicated the situation.

“It did also make things worse for us,” she said. “What could have ended quicker and a lot more efficient kind of just backlogged a bit.”

The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies confirmed that one person was detained in connection with the incident.

In a statement, Monroe County Republican Committee Chairman Patrick Reilly criticized local officials’ response, describing it as “Democratic officials cheering on vandalism and bullying of law enforcement,” calling it “completely disgusting.”

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to appoint hundreds of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges.
It's very demeaning to the expertise of the current immigration judge corps.
Immigration law is recognized as being the second-most-complex area of law in the country, second maybe to tax law.
So they’re not even going to be there long enough to have the normal immigration judge training applied to them.","What is happening is that established law is being disregarded, if not outright violated at an astonishing pace.

[During my tenure], ICE was extremely rarely allowed to make arrests in the courthouse because of the chilling effect it would have on people appearing in court. Or the chilling effect it would have on their ability to obtain witnesses that they might need and have their witnesses come forward and testify.

What about this tactic employed by the Department of Homeland Security in which it requests the dismissal of a case, then ICE immediately detains that person? Seems counterintuitive.

In the old days, if DHS wanted the case dismissed, it was on the assumption that you were not an enforcement priority, and you would be fine. Now, they’re taking people into custody immediately, because they no longer have the protection that has traditionally been afforded to people who had ongoing proceedings before the court.

[The government] is trying to bypass the immigration court system and make it irrelevant by going through a process called expedited removal, which is conducted by DHS officials, not by immigration court judges.

For years, expedited removal proceedings only occurred when someone had been present in the United States for less than two years and was within 100 miles of the border. Now they’ve said it applies nationwide, and they’re putting the burden of showing you’ve been here for more than two years on applicants. Do you walk around with rental receipts for two years in your pocket in case you bump into ICE? No.

Having worked under the full Trump administration before, there were management decisions that I didn’t agree with, but I did not feel there was such a blatant disregard of the substantive law. Now I feel like there's no consideration given to the substantive law. At most, there’s very superficial lip service.

I imagine you’ve got strong feelings about the judge firings. You were head of the National Association of Immigration Judges union for 14 years. The DOJ has terminated a third of the judges at San Francisco Immigration Court – a lot of them were people you worked alongside. And across the country, dozens more have been fired. Many wonder how these firings can be legal.

It is a violation of law in most of the cases.

There’s a difference between [a judge] who is on probation — that means during their first two years. If you’re on probation, you are an at-will employee, so they can let you go because they don’t like the color of your tie that day.

But everyone else is supposed to be protected under the civil service laws and have an opportunity to go to the Merit Systems Protections Board and be fired only for cause.

[Many of the people] that are being fired are not on probation. They are not being afforded the traditional civil service protections, because the administration is taking the legal position that the president has sole unfettered authority over anyone employed in the executive branch.

This is unheard of in the 45 years that I’ve been an immigration attorney.

What I really don’t get is why the Trump administration is getting rid of judges when there’s a long backlog of cases. People are waiting years for their chance to see a judge and plead their case.

The reason the courts are so backlogged is because Congress and the Department of Justice ignored the need to hire more immigration judges for the past decade or more. For years they added money for enforcement and ignored the immigration courts.

That clogged the system, because we didn’t have enough judges — when it was obvious that the simple solution to the backlog is hiring enough people to decide those cases.

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to appoint hundreds of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges. What do you think of that plan? What’s the transition going to be like for those new judges?

It's very demeaning to the expertise of the current immigration judge corps. Immigration law is recognized as being the second-most-complex area of law in the country, second maybe to tax law.

So they’re proposing to take on judges who have absolutely no background in immigration law. They say they’re going to train them, but their term is only six months. Currently immigration judges are trained and mentored for a full year. So they’re not even going to be there long enough to have the normal immigration judge training applied to them.

Why should someone in this country who doesn’t have an immigrant in their life with an open asylum case care about what’s happening in immigration courts?

Number one, any time due process is diminished for anyone, that creates a risk for everyone. It starts setting a precedent where, as U.S. citizens, you would be the next step with having your due process rights encroached upon.

Number two, the immigration courts are the only face of the American justice system that most noncitizens face, because the majority are not criminals. So if they have to leave and go back to their home country, I want them to respect the American justice system and feel like they were treated fairly and not go back bitter and hating America, because who knows what will happen next if that’s the case? Are those people ripe to be radicalized as anti-Americans?

But there are very few American citizens who are not touched by this fairly directly. The only good thing about the harshness of what the Trump administration is doing is that people who otherwise had no reason to know anything about immigration laws are being outraged, as they have people in their orbit — be it coworkers or members of their church congregations or people who have helped them in constructing their garage or in weeding their garden. These normal people that they never bothered to find out about — those are the people who have no legal way to regularize their status. It’s heartbreaking.

Up until recently, it didn’t touch [the lives of citizens] directly, but Trump is making sure it affects everybody.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_c7rfhlguup4s7d04ilb72h467c/-C100.00%25x78.71%25%2C0.00%25%2C19.44%25-FWEBP,N,,2025-09-11 13:57:25.779410

No president has sought to fire a Fed governor before.
Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal court has ruled that embattled Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook can remain in her position while she fights President Donald Trump’s efforts to fire her.

The ruling, which will almost certainly be appealed, is a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to assert more control over the traditionally independent Fed, which sets short-term interest rates to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Congress has also sought to insulate the Fed from day-to-day politics.

Cook is a Georgia native and a Spelman College graduate.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb late Tuesday granted Cook’s request for a preliminary injunction blocking her firing while the dispute makes its way through the courts. Cobb ruled that Cook would likely prevail in the lawsuit she filed late last month to overturn her firing.

Atlanta condo at center of Trump’s attempted firing of Cook

Trump, a Republican, said he was firing Cook on Aug. 25 over allegations raised by one of his appointees that she committed mortgage fraud related to two properties she purchased in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta in 2021, before she joined the Fed. Cook is accused of saying the properties were “primary residences,” which could have resulted in lower down payments and mortgage rates than if either was designated a second home or investment property.

The White House insisted Trump had the right to fire Cook.

“President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said Wednesday in a statement. “This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump Administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed.”

But Cobb ruled that the allegations likely weren’t sufficient legal cause to fire Cook. Under the law governing the Fed, governors can only be removed “for cause,” which Cobb said was limited to actions taken during a governor’s time in office.

The “removal of a Federal Reserve Governor extends only to concerns about the Board member’s ability to effectively and faithfully execute their statutory duties, in light of events that have occurred while they are in office,” Cobb wrote. Cobb was appointed by President Joe Biden, a Democrat.

“President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook’s removal,” the ruling added.

The decision means Cook will be able to participate in the Fed’s meeting Sept. 16-17, when it is expected to reduce its key short-term rate by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%.

Federal Reserve governors aren’t like cabinet secretaries and the law doesn’t allow a president to fire them over policy disagreements or because he simply wants to replace them. Congress sought to insulate the Fed from political pressure, the court noted, by giving Fed governors long, staggered terms that make it unlikely a president can appoint a majority of the board in a single term.

“Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law,” Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a written statement. “Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.”

The court also directed the Fed’s board of governors and its chair, Jerome Powell, “to allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the Board for the pendency of this litigation.”

Lowell had argued in court filings that Cook was entitled to a hearing and a chance to respond to the charges before being fired but was not provided either. The court agreed that she was not provided due process by the Trump administration. Her lawsuit denied the charges but did not provide more details.

Cook-Trump case is latest power struggle over independence of Federal Reserve

The case could become a turning point for the 112-year-old Federal Reserve. No president has sought to fire a Fed governor before. Economists prefer independent central banks because they can do unpopular things like lifting interest rates to combat inflation more easily than elected officials.

Many economists worry that if the Fed falls under the control of the White House, it will keep its key interest rate lower than justified by economic fundamentals to satisfy Trump’s demands for cheaper borrowing. That could accelerate inflation and could also push up longer-term interest rates, such as those on mortgages and car loans. Investors may demand a higher yield to own bonds to offset greater inflation in the future, lifting borrowing costs for the U.S. government, and the entire economy.

If Trump can replace Cook, he may be able to gain a 4-3 majority on the Fed’s governing board. Trump appointed two board members during his first term and has nominated a key White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to replace Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on Miran’s nomination.

Trump has said he will only appoint to the Fed people who will support lower rates.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell and the other members of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee for not cutting the short-term interest rate they control more quickly. It currently stands at 4.3%, after Fed policymakers reduced it by a full percentage point late last year. Trump has said he thinks it should be as low as 1.3%, a level that no Fed official and few economists support.

Powell recently signaled that the central bank was leaning toward cutting its rate at its meeting next week.

Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and prior to joining the board she taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

COMING UP: The fate of hundreds of unaccompanied minor children hangs in the balance as a federal judge, Tim Kelly, weighs whether to block their summary removal from the United States. At 2 p.m. ET, Kelly will hear argument on the children’s motion to enjoin their deportation. Follow along ⬇️ 🧵

BACKGROUND: In the middle of the night on Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration rounded up dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children and put them on airplanes for deportation. That prompted speedy intervention by Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who temporarily halted their summary removal. 2/

Now a different judge, Tim Kelly, must decide whether to grant longer-term relief while the children litigate their case. Kelly is a Trump appointee. More details in my @lawfare piece: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-judicial-learning-curve

THE LAW: In theory, the law is supposed to protect these children from being whisked out of the country by the government at a moment’s notice. A statute, the TVPRA, says unaccompanied children not from Mexico or Canada must be placed in immigration court proceedings & provided access to counsel.

The government basically takes the view that it can ignore the TVPRA. It points to a subsection of the HSA of 2002, which provides that, among other things, the Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for “reuniting unaccompanied alien children with a parent abroad in appropriate cases.""

The government says this “reunification” provision allows ORR to ""reunite"" unaccompanied children with their parents in Guatemala without regard to the statutory protections set out in the TVPRA. Frankly, it's a really insane argument, and its implications are staggering.

The other thing you need to know is that the government previously told Judge Sooknanan that all of the parents of these children had requested their return to Guatemala. But DOJ has since dropped that claim (because it quickly became clear that it was utterly false).

Ok here we go. Judge Kelly is on the bench, and counsel for the children is up first. It's Efren Olivares representing them today. (Audio isn't great so bear with me)

Judge Kelly begins with questions about voluntary departure, which a child can apply for in the course of immigration proceedings.

Judge: You all argue that for voluntary departure an immigration judge must sign off -- do you agree statute doesn't require final order of removal? Olivares argues once child is in immigration proceedings, judge has final word. But Kelly seems to want a statute or reg that says that.

Kelly then says that a lot of the plaintiffs arguments are about things DHS can't do, but it's essentially HHS taking this action (because the ""reunification"" provision applies to ORR, a division of HHS, which has custody of the children).

Judge Kelly: TVPRA says need to place child in removal proceedings, but that only kicks in if DHS is seeking to remove a child, not some other agency taking action pursuant to some other statute. What's plaintiff response to idea that it's not DHS doing anything here, it's HHS/ORR?

Olivares points to 6 USC 269c, saying that nothing in that section transfers authority to ORR away from immigration judges/other officials who adjudicate immigration benefits under the INA

The discussion turns to imminence and irreparable harm, but the audio starts going in and out......😩 Seems to be back now, however.

Judge is asking about whether he has to find that the plaintiffs should irreparable harm for the entire class. What if they showed for 95%, but not 5% of. the proposed class? Olivares says that's not a bar to the requested relief.

Judge Kelly mentions that the gov claims that they aren't including anyone with a pending asylum claim in the repatriation program. Why should those people be included in class?

Olivares basically says that the government can't be taken at its word. Evidence in record is that there are children who have pending applications...others don't but that's not what the statute requires.

Judge Kelly asks about language for proposed order. What would he include? Olivares says they are requesting that he certify a class of all unaccompanied minors not from countries contiguous with the US (so, not Mexico or Canada)

Olivares also mentions a separate issue the plaintiffs wanted to raise, which is that some of the kids who were woken up in the middle of the night and taken to the airport were in long term foster care but were placed in a shelter when they returned from the airport.

Now Sarah Welch is up for DOJ. Judge Kelly wants to start with questions about ""the facts."" I was struck by the fact that the government's representations have seemed to ""evolve,"" he says.

To that end, Judge Kelly notes that Drew Ensign told Judge Sooknanan that all of the parents requested the return of the children. He cites a Guatemalan government report, published by Reuters days later, which says that none of the parents requested/wanted their return.

Welch basically says she can't make any representations on that point. The audio is poor, but she says something to the effect that a record hasn't been developed on that point.

Judge asks if he should treat the government's earlier representation as withdrawn. Welch says she can't make representations on that point. Judge Kelly says ok, so I should treat that as withdrawn. Then he asks if the gov's plans have changed based on info that parents didn't request return.

Welch, for DOJ, says the government's plans haven't changed. The government's view is that a parental request for return is not required. This is initiated and requested by the government of Guatemala.

Now Judge Kelly wants to know if the government plans to reassess for the children whose attorneys have now objected to their removal. Welch says the objection would have to be credible fear based or some other disqualifying claim. ""Mere"" objection of ""I don't want to return"" not sufficient

Judge Kelly: Government says there were 300-something kids eligible at first, but that has been whittled down. But could that number grow, children be added? Welch says there are children arriving across the border, continuing to enter ORR custody.

Judge Kelly asks about plans for repatriation of kids from other non-contiguous countries (countries that aren't Guatemala). You represented no immediate plans, he says. Does government reserve right to do that in middle of night on weekend, as it did with these kids?

Welch: I think everyone can agree it's unfortunate that the children were frightened and woken up in the middle of the night.

Judge Kelly asks about assurance [from Guatemalan gov] that children won't be trafficked upon return. Do you have anything else you can share about what specifically that assurance was? Welch says she doesn't have more information she can share.

Ok, now we're onto legal arguments. Welch begins to set out the government's view that 6 USC 279 provides ORR with independent statutory authority and that ""reunification""/""repatriation"" are different from ""removal""...then audio cuts out, briefly. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/6/279

Kelly summarizes the view: Government takes view that this statute gives government other way to make person leave the country that is not ""removal"" under the INA/TVPRA. It overrides other immigration statutes...Are there other examples you can point to that do that?

Welch doesn't have any other examples she can point to. But she says it's not surprising that Congress would carve out multiple routes that pay ""particular attention to"" the need of unaccompanied alien children who are a particularly vulnerable population.

When Kelly asks a version of the same question again, Welch says that though she's not aware of any other statute that does something like this, she's also not aware of any other statute that transfers custody over migrants to a different agency (as 6 USC 279 does for ORR)

Kelly: When has the government relied on this construction of the statute before? I get there is one case about someone being released to a UK embassy, but you're not saying the government thought it was lawful because of this reunification authority? This is 1st time gov has made argument in court?

Welch can't point to a specific example of the government making this argument in court before.

Judge Kelly asks about the fact that the plaintiffs have declarations from a lot of the children who say they don't want to go back. Is it fair to say that I just don't have much to consider [from the government] to the contrary?

Welch: I agree that we don't have declaration in record saying that, but plaintiffs say they do not dispute that some child might want to go back...This makes the class fundamentally unsuitable for mandatory no opt-out class treatment...

Judge Kelly: Let's say I denied the PI. And a whole bunch of plaintiffs were removed. And then the case is litigated and I find they do have a right to removal proceedings. Is the government's representation that those plaintiffs would then be returned?

Welch says that her understanding is that removal is not categorically irreparable harm because a person in general can be returned to the United States.

Judge Kelly: Any affirmative points we did not get to? In response, Welch mentions two cases brought by similarly situated children in Arizona and Chicago. (The proceedings are ongoing in those cases, with a PI hearing scheduled in AZ tomorrow) Then Olivares is back up.

He first mentions a statutory subsection requiring that an order for voluntary departure be issued by an immigration judge. Then he talks about class relief. He says government can't avoid class certification by offering relief to named plaintiffs as a matter of grace. Cites AARP ruling by SCOTUS.

Olivares underscores that the government still has not denied that they might try to remove children from other countries under their ""reunification"" theory.

Addressing irreparable harm, Olivares points to a recent case that found irreparable harm when the prospect of removal involves risk of irremediable error. And again, he says, we haven't heard representation that this harm could be reversed.

Judge Kelly: What is your response to the government's argument that there are children who don't face harm once they get back to Guatemala and could later be brought back...What's your response that person doesn't face irreparable harm because removal is not irreparable harm?

Olivares says that they don't need to show irreparable harm for every single class member.

Olivares turns things over to Rupa Bhattacharyya, who addresses a few additional legal arguments for class certification.

Judge Kelly summarily concludes, saying that he'll get a decision to the parties as soon as possible. And we're done. Thanks all for following along!

At 2pm there will be a preliminary injunction hearing in the Guatemalan children case (LGML v. Noem). I hope to live-blog here for @Lawfare , as will colleague @Anna Bower on another platform. For bracing & thorough background, see Anna's piece here: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-judicial-learning-curve /1

If you recall, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan entered a temporary restraining order 8/31, barring the removals— govt calls them ""reunifications""—of Guatemalan children ages 10-17. Govt has admitted intent to deport 327 children, with the first 76 booked for departure at 10:45am ET on 8/31. ... /2

... Judge Sooknanan was just covering the emergency docket that day—it was Sunday Labor Day weekend—so now the case has been randomly assigned to Judge Tim Kelly, who must decide whether to extend the TROs into a preliminary injunction & whether to certify a class. ... /3

... The petitioners claim that the govt's attempted removal of the children violated the Trafficking Victims Protection & Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA) (8 U.S. Code § 1232), which contemplates extensive protections for unaccompanied alien children (UACs). But ... /4

... the govt argues that an obscure provision (6 USC § 279(b)(1)(H) lets it, in essence, circumvent those rules to ""reunify"" children with parents or legal guardians. Petitioners say they've seen evidence govt plans to try same thing with Honduran & maybe Salvadoran children. ... /5

A report of the Guatemalan National Attorney Generals, issued last week, did *not* confirm the US govt's suggestion that Guatemalan parents/guardians were seeking return of their children. None of those surveyed were. ... /6

Judge Kelly has taken the bench. /7

[sound is a little soft] Start with plaintiffs lawyer Efrén C. Olivares. Judge: you all argue in papers that for voluntary departure child must either receive an order -- that Immigration judge must sign off -- do you agree statute doesn't require final order of removal? /8

Olivares: we agree , doesn't require ... [sound is soft.] Judge: does judge have to sign off -- is that law, or a reg, or a practice. it doesn't seem to say that. O: once a child is in proceedings, IJ has the final word. /9

Judge: and source of that--just inherent in nature of proceedings? O: yes, inherent in the spirit of INA. J: assuming the child wants to leave US as soon as possible -- just assuming -- and child is in removal proceedings, and child wants to leave ... how long would that take? /10

O: refer to exhibit from former immigration judge ... takes [long time] J: even where child wants to go back? ... OK. Defs say the authority they're exercising is [different]. ... placement in removal proceedings is only when DHS seeks to remove child. not some other agency. so ... /11

... Judge Kelly cont: what do you make of that argument. saying it's not DHS doing something, it's HHS doing something, so it's not covered. that's outside scope of the statute's you sight. O: i'd point to 6 USC 269c ... nothing transfers authority away from [immigration judges] /12

J: govt argues that 8 USC 1252f1 bars me from granting injunctive relief. O: that provision was enacted before the TVPRA. not covered by it. ... J: In order for me to grant preliminary injunction to class do i have to find that each class member would suffer irreparable harm or ... /13

O: we think entire class is at risk. court is empowered to prevent imminent harm J: so your view is that even for minors who are not Guatemalan ... you've made broader request. ... for [noncontiguous] countries ... why is imminence requirement met? O: we've put before court /14

... evidence relating to other countries that tracks the same pattern. we've attempted to get govt [to reassure us they aren't doing that and they won't]. J: your comments suggest plaintiff could make up for imminence by irreparability. not sure that's 100% accurate. ... /15

.. J: you'd have to show some level of imminence here. O: correct. ... in case of Guatemala, imminence was a couple hours. we're trying to avoid another [attempt over the weekend to whisk them out of the country]. J: do you agree you have to show imminent harm for every class member? /16

J: if i found you'd shown irreparable harm for 95% of class, but 5% you hadn't. is that a bar to me? O: that is not. ... inability to show harm to small percentage of class not a bar ... been held in the circuit. recent cases cited in our brief. we've presented dozens of declarations from class members that show sufficient imminence of harm. /17

J: govt says: we disclaim that anybody with an asylum claim is part of our plan , whyh would those people be included? O: sorryt to say, we cannot take defs at their word. ... evidence in record that children who have pending applications ... others have not, but that's not what statute requires. /18

... J: the other example i'll throw out to you ... suppose a plaintiff who says i want to go back to guatemala. a person in that scenario ... tell me why that person ... you have a showing of irreparable harm for that person. O: in that hypo ... depends on age of child. ... /19

O: ... all we're asking is that the process be followed. we're not trying to stop that [in that hypothetical example]. J: and that lack of that procedure is irreparable harm? O: correct. J: So loss of process -- even if child is saying i want to go back -- the loss of those required procedure is irreparable harm in and of itself. /20

O: yes, in the case of that hypothetical child, and we don't have that case before us. J: should have said ... obviously ... any child that you have a declaration for saying if i go back i have risk of being trafficked or abused--goes without saying [there's irreparable harm for him/her]. /21

J: do you have any -- you've given me a proposed order -- but anything else , other language you think is important to prevent irreparable harm for whatever class i [certify] O: requesting no repatriation of any UAC from any country other than Mexico or Canada. [law is different for those countries.] /22

O: some of the children woken up in middle of night and taken to buses and airport ... in longterm foster care. now they've been put in group shelters. we'd ask that be sent back to their longerm foster care homes. ... that's come to light in last few days. /23

J: those are the questions i had. anything else you want to make sure i get? O: my co-counsel can address questions about the class you may have. otherwise that's all. DOJ counsel Sarah Welch: J: first some questions on facts. ... /24

J: i was struck how govt's reps as to subgroup of children who were planned to be sent to guatemala ... struck by gov't's representations with respect to tgheir parents. you told judge sooknanan they all had parents in guatemala waiting for them. i have before me recorrd from guatemala AG how few parents they were even able to locate. None had requested they come back. /25

J: do you all contest what that report lays out? if not, has that altered what govt plans to do? W: i don't have anything ... no to that question. [can't hear her voice; too soft] J: should assume representation made to judge sooknanan was wrong? W: i can't affirmatively represent that. J: does that mean govt's plans have changed? /26

DOJ atty Welch: i'm not aware of any change. our view is that parental request is not required. ... govt of US working with govt of guatemala on this. J: even if not req'd by statute, but it was certainly an important key fact that govt leaned on in arguing to Judge Sooknanan. that this was consensual. more than consensual. parents were asking. /27

J: Ok. put parents aside. now we have some children who you had identified as ""eligible"" that in the group of 327 ... at least 5 of those as named plaintiffs here who say they dont want to go back. i guess the question is: does that change the govt's plans for these kids? /28

W: it certainly does. ... [too soft for me to here] we've already determined 5 of 10 named plaintiffs not eligible. the remaining 5 now have attys ... so under our criteria, none are eligible. J: because other attys objected? W: the attys in the courtroom. /29

J: does govt plan ... to circle back and see whether other plaintiffs object to going back W: a number of other objections have come in. J: so for anyone for whom a lawyer has objected—that kicks the person out of eligibility? W: [yes] J: do all 327 have attys? W: they didn't as of 8/31. now many more do. /30

J: for that group ... who doesn't have an atty , is the govt planning to initiate some sort of process to see whether the [child?] objects? W: [couldn't hear] J: you're not ruling out that there's some group of folks who do not have a lawyer and govt does not know if child objects ... would child remain ""eligible"" for [reunification] /31

W: mere objection would not disqualify the child. J: [what about plans for doing this for UACs from other countries] W: my understsanding is govt doesn't have immediate plans for any other country. no immediate actions. J: that 327 number has been whittled down ... is there a possibility of adding to it? W: do think it's possible. children arriving across border now. or [voice too soft] ... /32

Judge: now let's talk about ... what if anything can govt represent about another group of guatemalan children or from other noncontiguous countries -- you said no certain or immediate plans. Does govt reserve right to do that in middle of night on weekend. W: can't think of a reason for doing that. everyone agrees it was unfortunate children were frightened. /33

Judge: if plaintiffs are right and children have to be put into removal proceedings but are eligible for voluntary departure -- tell me about that process. what's required in statute, reg, practice. and how long it takes. ... Welch: i don't have statistics. ... not aware there's a statute that requires judicial approval. /34

Judge: but is that the typical [way the process works]. i mean judge oversees that ... typically signs off in some way. Welch: not sure I can [answer] what the practice is. J: One of the criteria for eligibility was that govt was given assurances by Guatemala that the child wouldn't be trafficked. W: yes. /35

J: do you have any more info about that representation. what the assurance was? W: i don't have more i can share. ... multiple communications with Guatemala thru dept of state. J: the part of the statute that to me gave you all the most [trouble?] is part that describes -- 1232a5C -- talks about repatriation ... hard for me to read that and conclude you could repatriate someone without removing them. W: /36

W: [didn't catch her response] J: so under your reading, repatriation and reunification are different concepts, different authorities. W: repatriation in 1232 is broader than reunification [in 6 USC 279] J: so your argument is the authority you lay out creates another way for a person to leave the US that is not removal. ... /37

J: ... so it effectively overrides the INA. (Immigration and Nationality Act) . any other examples of authority you can point to where congress said, okay, we're going to carve out these people and say INA doesn't apply to them? W: first, dont have another example to offer at this point. /38

W: but i dont think it's circumventing the IRA. Congress has set up multiple routes. ... not surprising to see separate ways children could leave the US J: does it seem strange to you that under your reading the procedures that children from noncontinguous countries -- is it govt's view that same reunification authority could be used in case of someone from canada or mexico? W: yes, and it has been. /39

J: okay, but there's no other group you can think of where congress said i'm going to hand authority to an official outside DHS. ... It's another pathway to kick someone out of the country. or have them leave the country. W: the INA is a particular enactment. Transfers functions from DHS to HHS. Body of immigration laws is what court now has before it. /40

W: .. I'm not aware of other aliens that someone other than DHS has authority. J: isn't it fair to think -- construing the words themselves -- it strikes me that removal is a word that suggests exit from the US. but it doesn't say where or how or under what circumstances. /41

J: ... and the word reunification suggests something that occurs after you're removed. after you leave. isn't it natural to think of repatriation and reunification as capturing a separate set of things, something congress adds on and says, OK, we're not going to just drop these people off in middle of ocean or bring them to port of entry and say good luck ... /42

J: ... so they specify some things that happen afterward to make sure they wind up in the right country and right place. why isn't that nature reading of those terms. W: not sure i'd agree that reunification refers to something that occurs after ... in the abstract, removal is suggesting an external force in a way that's different from reunification. /43

W: removal is a word used throughout immigration statutes in way reunification doesn't. separate mechanism that allows children to be returned to parents abroad. J: ... construing a statute court can look to practice. ... /44

J: ... i don't think you can point to cases involving mexico and canada [because law is different for them]. [Now they're discussing an example involving a release to the UK.] J: certainly this is first time -- sunday labor day weekend is first time govt made that argument to a court, right? W: not aware [of another]. /45

J: and the issue of what to do with UACs from noncontiguous countries is not a good one. W: yes ... but numbers have changed in recent years ... spiked to tremendous pressing problem. J: no reason to doubt what you're saying but it gets a little tricky in terms of govt arguing this is longstanding interpretation when canada & mexico examples are [different]. You do have one example but ... /46

J: ... when you have ambassador saying i've got the parents right here .. that's different. waht's gov't's position on (a) whether these children are entitled to notice & opportunity to be heard; and (b) was what govt did over labor day weekend sufficient? W: we do think it was sufficient for due process. ... /47

W: these are children in govt custody. notice goes to caregiver. not to child. ... children do have limited due process rights when they are in govt custody. J: your briefing is replete with references to children wanting to return home. obviously you don't have to prove that. but you offered it up as [going to] the equities. but as of right now i dont think i have any evidence of anyone ... /48

J: ... in the putative class who affirmatively wishes to go back to Guatemala. Is that something ... it drops out of the analysis. you dont have to prove it. but ... W: agree we dont have declaration in record saying that. but plaintiffs say they do not dispute that some child might want to go back ... that makes this class unsuited for [Rule 23] (b)(2) mandatory no-opt-out class treatment.

J: I dont think plaintiffs are asking me to bar any plaintiff from voluntary departure. W: they've told the court that that takes weeks or months. not all classmembers [may want that]. most of these children are in our shelters. ORR's [Office of Refugee Resettlement] job is to pursue the best interests of the child. ... this is case that's fundamentally unsuited for b2 certification. /50

J: i take your point that plaintiffs dont rule out that some of the Guatemalan children -- there might be some child in there who wants to be sent back. can't rule that out. question is, what does that mean for purposes of class certification W: significance: not disagreeing that's an individualized determination for each child. so that's not susceptible to classwide proof. /51

J: for purposes of thinking about a class and irreparable harm, what do you take as import of -- let me back up. you just laid out your view with respect to class certification because of that concession by plaintiffs. let me ask in terms of irreparable harm: is it govt's view ... /52

J: ... that with respect to irreparable harm, fact that every member of class might be facing irreparable harm, that doesn't bar me from certifying class? W: we don't agree. they're requesting several different classes. J: because of imminence? because you've removed some from table? W: right. no irreparable harm if they don't risk leaving the country. /53

J: it's a black box what a particular plaintiff wants and what would happen to them if they go back. might reunite with parents. might be in foster situation. could class capture some who might not be at risk? W: i don't think so. if that child doesn't face risks in Guatemala. if doesn't face any risks of harm in Guatemala and could be returned to US in case of mistake. /54

J: what is govt's view--you brought up returningn to the country. are you representing--let's say i denied preliminary injunction and whole bunch of plaintiffs left the country to Guatemala. and eventually i found that they were entitled to be placed in removal proceedings. is it your position that govt would consent to have them returned? /55

W: my understanding is that removal is not categoricallly understood to be irreparable harm under SCOTUS precedent because person can be returned to u.s. J: that's correct. W: that's precisely why removal is not irreparable harm. person can be returned to US after final judgment. /56

J: do you have, in class context, a case that stands for proposition that every single person who's a member of the class without exception would have to be facing irreparable harm? W: i agree ... everyone needs to be at risk of the challenged action. plaintiffs have conceded that child's best interests is fact-intensive individualized question. /57

J: you're conflating best interest of the child with irreparable harm. one final question: you're telling me no named plaintiff is now at risk from the challenged action, what is the legal import of that W: there is no class rep who can adequately represent that class or whose claims are typical of the class. /58

W: ... none of the class members is eligible for reunification. J: because none of the named plaintiffs are still eligible [for reunification]. Anything else? Welch: i do want to mention 2 other cases. District of Arizona. no request for class certification in that case. PI hearing tomorrow. another in NDIll. 4 plaintiffs. /59

J: plaintiffs counsel, anything you want to add? O: yes a few points. to clarify: request for voluintary departure must be granted by immigration judge. [he cites the statute]. [8 usc 1229c. (?)] also want to be clear: ORR never notified even attys of children who were represented. ORR notified caregivers. /60

as far as class certification, in AARP .. there were only 2 named plaintiffs, and SCOTUS ... said the govt can't avoid class relief by offering individual named plaintiffs relief as matter of grace. Also, we did not hear denial that they may eventually try to take children [from other countries out of the country under the same theories.] /61

O: On the issue of relationship between the 2 statutes here. the TVPRA is much more specific statute. J: it's more specific than which? O: than title 6 USC 279b1h. ... doesn't mean courts can disregard other statutes ... as for example of child from United kIngdom--that child was sent from UK to be reunited with grandmother. no indication [what process was followed] ... /61

J: govt says that supports their position that they were using an authority outside the INA. as far as facts go, i think we're all on same page, though. O: on irreparable harm: WMM v Trump ... when prospect of removal involves risk of irremediable error. J: where? O: 5th circuit court of appeals. /62

O: here 11 children have expressed fear of removal. fear of torture , persecution. J: i hear you on that. what is your response to govt's argument that ... with respect to a particular member of the class that doesn't face harm—fact that that person exists. govt makes argument that if mistake is made they can be brought back. /63

O: a few responses. we do not have to show irrep harm for every single member of class. also, child might be eligible for another form of relief here and might miss out on that if taken to Guatemala. Now his co-counsel will address some questions: Rupa Bhattacharyya: [she cites a precedent she says addresses govt's arguments about class certification] /64

B: second, [i think it's incredibly telling that] in face of incredibly reticulated statute [protecting rights of children] the govt points to a section of a different law of less than a dozen words [in 279b1H]. it's simply not the way the law works. the more specific law always triumphs over the more general. /65

B: third, no req't that every member has to face irreparable harm. ... AARP supports that proposition. whole purpose of having class representatives is to J: govt says you dont have any class reps at moment. the other 5 excluded earlier by their criteria, and now the other 5 are excluded. B: 2 responses ... /66

B: govt's forebearance is not sufficient [to disqualify a class representative (AARP)]. second thing, with respect to procedural due process claim--that's a right against mistaken deprivation. no assurance of protection against that. [Sorry i didn't really get that.] J: alright, i will get back to you all as soon as I can. /67

Here's what we ... - CNN,"Chris Boyette, Taylor Romine",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/11/us/katie-abraham-chicago-immigration-crackdown,"Abraham and Polzin were childhood friends from their time at the East Side Water Polo Club in the Chicago suburbs.
The death of the youngest daughter Joe Abraham’s youngest daughter loved water.
She loved all kinds of music, and Joe Abraham recalled sitting together and listening to music from his generation.
I’m just in this position now,” Joe Abraham told CNN.
He was using an alias … and really was not being any type of a productive person here in Illinois,” Joe Abraham told CNN.","Katie Abraham and Chloe Polzin were hunting for a late-night snack with three other friends on a frigid night in Urbana, Illinois.

The end of winter break was nearing for the two university students, who had traveled to Urbana to visit other water polo players at the University of Illinois, Abraham’s father told CNN.

It was nearly 2 a.m. on January 19 when 20-year-old Abraham and 21-year-old Polzin, along with their friends, stopped at a red light. Suddenly, an SUV came up quickly behind them, smashing into the car and injuring all five people inside, according to Urbana Police.

The two girls were killed in a drunken-driving hit-and-run collision, the Department of Homeland Security said, by a man in the United States illegally who fled the scene of the crime.

Abraham was pronounced dead at the hospital soon after the accident, police said. Polzin died the next day, according to her obituary.

Almost eight months after Abraham’s death, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching its latest immigration enforcement action in Illinois, “Operation Midway Blitz,” in her honor, drawing the 20-year-old’s name into national politics as an example of a broken immigration system amid a larger crackdown in cities across the US.

Her father, Joe Abraham, told CNN the federal government failed “miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”

What we know about the wreck

Temperatures had dropped as low as 2 degrees the night Abraham died, and never broke above freezing that day.

Abraham and Polzin were childhood friends from their time at the East Side Water Polo Club in the Chicago suburbs.

The two girls, along with three other friends, were sitting at a red light just 1.5 miles north of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign when a red Mitsubishi Outlander crashed into the back of their car, police said.

All five were taken to the hospital, according to police. While two were released with minor injuries and another made a recovery, Abraham was declared dead at the hospital. Polzin was declared brain dead the next day, according to her obituary.

The Polzin family did not respond to CNN’s attempts to speak with them for this story.

Police said the driver fled the scene on foot. Three days later, the US Marshals Service found him in Texas, riding a bus headed to Mexico.

The death of the youngest daughter

Joe Abraham’s youngest daughter loved water.

“I think she liked the water better than land,” her father said.

She played water polo for a travel team throughout high school and for a club team in college. She swam and did diving from a young age, he said.

Abraham, who was from Glenview, Illinois, was going into her third year at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, according to her father. She wasn’t certain yet, but he thinks she was leaning toward majoring in marketing. They intended to talk about it the next time she was home.

“She kind of had a plan of where she was going to go, and obviously that didn’t happen,” he said.

Joe Abraham said his daughter “loved life, and she knew how to enjoy it, and get the best out of it.”

He called her “such a special person,” who was genuine and authentic. She made everyone feel seen and had a terrific wit and a great sense of humor, he added.

She loved all kinds of music, and Joe Abraham recalled sitting together and listening to music from his generation.

She had an “eclectic group of friends,” and two siblings with whom she was close.

“She was just such a good sister to her older sister and older brother,” her father said. “It’s a sad, sad situation.”

What we know about the SUV driver

US Marshals tracked down the SUV driver three days after he fled the scene of the crime on an “El Expreso” bus – “the express” – heading to Matamoros, Mexico.

The man told police he was a 27-year-old Mexican named Juan Jahaziel Saenz-Suarez the morning he was captured. But a day later, he divulged to police that his identity was a lie – he was 29, from Guatemala. His name was actually Julio Cucul-Bol.

He was not legally in the United States and had used forged documents to hide his identity, police said.

Police filed new charges against Cucul-Bol for leaving the scene of a personal injury crash resulting in death, aggravated driving under the influence resulting in death and reckless homicide.

Federal prosecutors charged Cucul-Bol in May with possessing a false permanent resident card, possessing a false Social Security card, false use of a passport, and making a false statement on a bank application, according to the Department of Justice.

In February, Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an arrest detainer requesting local authorities notify ICE before Cucol-Bol is released, the agency told CNN. According to ICE records, he is being held in custody in Champaign, Illinois.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for an update on Cucul-Bol’s status. Court documents online do not list the name of a defense attorney for Cucul-Bol.

A death drawn into a political arena

Joe Abraham said the federal government first reached out to him in June, when House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman James Comer invited him to attend a committee meeting where Democratic governors – including J.B. Pritzker of Illinois – testified about their states’ so-called “sanctuary state” policies.

He said he had hoped to speak with Pritzker after the Illinois governor heard his daughter’s story, but told CNN, “No one could muster up even a look in my direction.”

A few weeks later, he said, he and his wife were contacted by the Trump administration and invited to the White House for an event for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”

“Joe, we will end this invasion once and for all, and we’re always going to remember the memory of Katie, the beautiful, beautiful 20-year-old daughter of yours,” Trump told him before shaking his hand and holding up a photo of the father and daughter.

“I don’t want to get political. I hate this crap. I’m just in this position now,” Joe Abraham told CNN.

He criticized the current Illinois government and the previous presidential administration for mishandling immigration and called for a vetting process before people are allowed in the country.

“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying everyone’s a criminal. What I’m saying is this guy in particular could have easily been filtered out of the system. He was using an alias … and really was not being any type of a productive person here in Illinois,” Joe Abraham told CNN. “And for him to take her life is a very sad state.”

Abraham’s parents were featured in a video posted by the Department of Homeland Security earlier this week, where the agency announced it was launching an immigration operation in Illinois.

A question appears in overlaid text on the video: “When you hear people say illegal aliens aren’t given due process, what’s your reaction?”

“Katie received no due process,” Joe Abraham says in the video.

“When you talk about due process, I wish she was in another country or in some detention center I can go see her, but she’s not, and I’ll never see her again.”

The Department of Homeland Security called Joe Abraham one day before the agency announced Operation Midway Blitz would be done in honor of their daughter.

“Some might say they’re leveraging me, but maybe we’re leveraging them a little bit so other kids don’t get killed, and other parents don’t have to go see what we’re going through,” he said. “So, maybe it’s a two-way street there. I was just happy someone acknowledged Katie.”

What is Operation Midway Blitz?

DHS on Monday announced “Operation Midway Blitz,” aimed at targeting “criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained at least five people over the weekend, including a flower vendor and a person waiting for the bus, Chicago Alderperson Jeylú Gutiérrez said Monday.

Ongoing arrests in Chicago are expected to expand as a federal presence builds up in a weeks-long, phased approach, according to officials familiar with the plans who stressed it’s still in flux.

The operations in Boston and Chicago are modeled after the June immigration sweeps in Los Angeles. The Supreme Court ruled Monday that immigration enforcement officials can continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment.

Pritzker denounced the DHS operations in the state Monday, saying in a post on X that the operation “isn’t about fighting crime.”

“That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” he said, adding that the administration has chosen to focus “on scaring Illinoisians.”

At that point immigration would be the main driver of new population growth instead of births.
Zoom out: The CBO previously said the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million in 2055.
Now, the agency says the population will be smaller and will grow more slowly, reaching only 367 million by 2055.
The population would also contain fewer working-age people — a hit to the labor supply that could slow economic growth.","The U.S. population will be smaller and grow more slowly than previously projected, a result of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration, per newly revised Congressional Budget Office estimates out Wednesday.

Why it matters: It's an economic red flag, with the potential to drive labor shortages, higher prices and a crisis of care for the nation's elderly.

State of play: Deaths are projected to start exceeding births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected, as a result of the White House crackdown, plus increased funding for immigration enforcement in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, leaving fewer immigrant families to have children and add to the population.

At that point immigration would be the main driver of new population growth instead of births.

Fertility rates have also declined slightly more than expected, per the CDC, since the agency published its January projection.

Catch up quick: The CBO had already revised down its growth projections in January, after the Biden administration cut back on immigration.

But the nonpartisan agency's latest estimates take into account the current administration's more aggressive recent actions, as well as the new legislation.

Zoom in: The CBO is now projecting that 290,000 immigrants will be ""removed"" from from the country, due to the new law, from 2026 - 2029.

Another 30,000 would leave voluntarily.

Zoom out: The CBO previously said the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million in 2055.

Now, the agency says the population will be smaller and will grow more slowly, reaching only 367 million by 2055.

The population would also contain fewer working-age people — a hit to the labor supply that could slow economic growth.

Reality check: The CBO says its projections are highly uncertain.

The estimates also swing significantly with policy shifts.

Between the lines: There are some predicting that the population could actually start declining as soon as this year because of net negative immigration— or more people leaving the country then coming in.

That would be a recipe for economic stagnation, as economic writer Derek Thompson has recently outlined. Think fewer working-age people to pay into Social Security, harvest crops, build homes, staff restaurants or provide health care.

Yes, but: The CBO is still predicting positive net immigration in 2025, mainly because of an increase of lawful permanent residents that offset big declines in unauthorized immigration.

What to watch: A three-year economic forecast based on these projections is due out Friday.",https://images.axios.com/pCJeVF37icIWNT5yOBz_lKP8icg=/0x0:1344x756/1366x768/2025/09/10/1757537586139.png,N,,2025-09-11 06:56:16.466497

The Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America filed suit against the Tennessee law just days before it took effect July 1.
Lawyers for the Synod argued that the law is an infringement on religious freedom, vaguely written and illegally sets immigration policy, a responsibility that falls to Congress.

Thus far, no one has been charged with a crime under the new law, Jones said.","A legal challenge to a new state law that criminalizes the act of concealing or sheltering individuals illegally in the country had its first day in court Wednesday as a federal judge weighed a motion to temporarily block portions of the legislation as the case goes forward.

The Southeastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America filed suit against the Tennessee law just days before it took effect July 1.

The denomination argued the law, passed as part of a Republican effort to align state policy with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, puts pastors and church members at risk for criminal charges in carrying out their faith-driven mission to offer shelter and sanctuary to individuals regardless of immigration status.

Lawyers for the Synod argued that the law is an infringement on religious freedom, vaguely written and illegally sets immigration policy, a responsibility that falls to Congress.

A Nashville landlord, concerned about criminal charges for renting to an immigrant without legal status, and an unidentified immigrant from Mexico are also plaintiffs in the suit.

An attorney defending the measure argued that pastors had a “needless fear of the law.”

Suit seeks to block Tennessee law that makes it a crime to “harbor” certain immigrants

The law makes it a crime to harbor immigrants “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain” and is intended to apply to “professional smuggling operations,” not churches that accept donations to provide services to those in need, argued Miranda Jones, senior assistant attorney general.

U.S. District Judge William Campbell, Jr. urged lawyers on both sides to agree on a compromise that would spell out that the law, at least temporarily, would not be enforced against members of the Lutheran Synod.

That effort failed once Jones told Campbell her superiors in the Tennessee Office of Attorney General would not agree; the state’s position is the law won’t target houses of worship, making a written agreement between the two parties unnecessary, she said.

“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me,” Campbell responded. “It’s difficult to understand the harm.”

Campbell instead required the attorneys to report to the court if any individuals represented in the suit faced arrest or prosecution under the new law.

Thus far, no one has been charged with a crime under the new law, Jones said.

Campbell deferred a decision on the request to temporarily halt the portion of state law that makes it a felony offense to harbor immigrants in the country illegally, saying he would “take it under advisement.”

Attorney General James led 20 other attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the federal government’s reinterpretation of a decades-old law governing access to social services. Today, a federal court granted Attorney General James and the coalition’s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking sweeping new rules that threatened to strip funding from programs like Head Start, Title X family planning clinics, food banks, domestic violence shelters, adult education, and community health centers.

“The Trump administration tried to rip apart the very programs that millions of families rely on to survive – from Head Start classrooms to cancer screenings to community food banks,” said Attorney General James. “Today’s ruling makes clear that their unlawful and cruel policies will not stand. With this victory, we are protecting children’s education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat. I will never stop fighting to ensure every community has the resources and support they deserve.”

Earlier this summer, four federal agencies – the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (ED), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) – issued a coordinated set of directives abruptly redefining longstanding policy under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). For nearly 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike interpreted PRWORA to allow states to offer vital public health, education, and anti-poverty programs regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration’s sudden reversal would have forced states to impose immigration status verification on countless services under the threat of catastrophic funding losses and program closures.

The court’s decision halts implementation of those new directives in the plaintiff states while litigation proceeds, ensuring that millions of families can continue to access critical services without fear of denial or disruption. With this ruling, the judge is acknowledging that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by issuing sweeping new mandates without lawful rulemaking, grossly misreading PRWORA, and failing to consider the devastating impacts on states and communities.

The victory has immediate impacts across New York:

Head Start: Protects early education for more than 43,000 low-income children at nearly 1,000 sites statewide.

Community Health Centers: Safeguards access to primary and preventive care for 2.4 million New Yorkers who rely on 850 community clinics.

Title X Clinics: Ensures reproductive health, cancer screenings, and STI testing for more than 300,000 patients each year.

Mental Health Programs: Preserves over $65 million in annual funding for crisis intervention, youth mental health, peer support, the 988 suicide hotline, and jail diversion programs.

Anti-Poverty Services: Maintains food, housing, and utility assistance provided by New York’s 47 Community Action Agencies to more than half a million residents annually.

The federal government said it interprets Head Start as a federal public benefit, similar to welfare programs that exclude immigrants in the country illegally.","A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Trump administration restrictions on services for immigrants in the country illegally, including the federal preschool program Head Start, health clinics and adult education.

The order from the judge in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island applies to 20 states and the District of Columbia, whose attorneys general, all Democrats, sued the administration. It puts the administration's reinterpretation of a Clinton-era federal policy on hold while the case is decided.

Under the proposed changes, some community-level programs would be reclassified as federal public benefits, making them inaccessible to people without legal status. Individual public benefits, such as food stamps and college financial aid, have been largely unavailable to people in the country without legal status.

U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said in her order that the policy rollout was “rushed” in a way that would worsen the impact for people cut off from community services and those tasked with verifying eligibility.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law,” McElroy wrote. “In its view, everyone ... has misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government. The Court is skeptical of that.”

Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Education Department, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice, which each were named as defendants.

The states’ lawsuit argued the government failed to follow the rulemaking process and did not provide the required notice on conditions placed on federal funds.

The rule changes had been paused initially within the states that sued after they reached a temporary agreement with the Trump administration.

“With this victory, we are protecting children’s education, safeguarding critical health care, and preserving the safety net that keeps families afloat,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said.

Proponents of Head Start immediately voiced concern that the new policy would harm immigrant communities by taking away health services and educational opportunities. The administrative burdens of implementing the new rule would cause many under-resourced Head Start programs to close, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint.

The federal government said it interprets Head Start as a federal public benefit, similar to welfare programs that exclude immigrants in the country illegally. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose agency oversees Head Start, said the directive would stop diverting “hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.”

In addition to preserving Head Start access, the lawsuit also sought to block the restrictions on other federal programs, including substance abuse services, mental health resources in schools, career and technical education, and job training opportunities.

Nevins, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/us-immigration-policy,"Even though undocumented workers pay taxes and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy, they still lack labor protection in U.S. labor laws.
This raises the question: How do we protect those who maintain our food system while they remain increasingly vulnerable?
These visas enable foreign nationals to obtain temporary work permits for agricultural jobs when local workers are unavailable.
What’s needed is reform that builds a stable, sustainable, and humane labor system for the future of American agriculture.
It's important to recognize that many migrant workers endure abuse and exploitation out of fear of deportation.","This reality isn’t unique to Missouri. It’s mirrored in agricultural communities across the country, where immigrant workers form the foundation of our food system.

Meatpacking is grueling, dangerous work. With injury rates three times the national average, hazards like amputations, high-speed production lines, and constant repetitive motions that can cause musculoskeletal issues are daily realities while on the floor. Workers must face long hours in cold, loud environments, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with little break time and limited, if any, access to personal protective equipment (PPE). These working conditions declined during the COVID pandemic and remain demanding today.

And in spite of the risks, undocumented laborers continue to make up a substantial portion of the workforce; about 23% of workers are undocumented, and 42% are foreign-born in this sector.

The U.S. is criminalizing the very people keeping it fed. Immigration crackdowns don’t just break up families; they break supply chains. That means meatpacking plants losing essential workers, farms going understaffed, and local economies potentially being pushed to the brink.

The meatpacking industry has a long history of worker exploitation, though.

Meatpacking plants were first built in large cities where workers had better access to unions and collective bargaining. However, new companies began relocating to rural areas, where union presence was weaker and labor costs were lower, effectively moving the industry away from its unionized roots.

With the move to rural areas, plants recruited Latin American immigrants to fulfill the low-wage, demanding jobs that native-born workers were less willing to do.

Even though undocumented workers pay taxes and significantly contribute to the nation’s economy, they still lack labor protection in U.S. labor laws. They live every day among escalated anti-immigrant rhetoric and threats of deportations and family separations hanging over their heads.

These workers are not transient, but rather embedded in the communities they help sustain. In fact, most undocumented immigrants in America have lived here for more than a decade.

Relying on a workforce without legal protections is an unsustainable and flawed model for employers and workers.

Mass deportations would weaken the economy, and the consequences would ripple across our food system. Unharvested crops, higher food prices for consumers, and reduced domestic food production can follow major labor shortages.

“You would see farms go out of business, and we could see interruption in our food supply,” testified American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this year.

This country and its people must find both a just and effective path forward for those who have repeatedly contributed to and are so vitally part of our success.

This raises the question: How do we protect those who maintain our food system while they remain increasingly vulnerable?

It is essential to recognize the role of H-2A visas in meeting agricultural labor needs. These visas enable foreign nationals to obtain temporary work permits for agricultural jobs when local workers are unavailable.

This system provides some assistance, but it also has its own financial and administrative barriers: its complex paperwork and high costs limit accessibility, especially for smaller farms. Simplifying the process, reducing expenses, and expanding the program to cover year-round positions would better meet the needs of farmers.

Visas fall far short of addressing the deeper, structural issues behind the agricultural workforce crisis. What’s needed is reform that builds a stable, sustainable, and humane labor system for the future of American agriculture.

Comprehensive immigration and labor reform is a long-term, politically complex process and goal.

In the meantime, we must focus on practical, community-based solutions.

One such approach is to invest in bilingual outreach and support networks that can advocate for workers. Partnerships like these should be expanded and permanently funded, not just in crisis moments throughout states.

In Missouri, the Migrant Farmworkers Assistance Fund (MFAF) provides essential bilingual case management and emergency assistance to migrant farmworkers and their families. The nonprofit’s staff meet with migrant workers upon their arrival at local orchards to help determine eligibility for public benefits, access medical and dental services, and assist with school enrollment for their children.

Monarch Immigrant Services, based in St. Louis, plays a vital role in promoting equity and stability for these groups as well. By providing mental health services, social support, legal assistance, language services, and senior engagement to over 3,000 individuals, they’re effectively working to invest in immigrant and refugee communities through equitable access to transformative services.

Local solutions can – and do – provide immediate relief. These services not only keep workers uplifted, but they also help them remain stable and resilient.

Another potential step is the adoption of fair labor certification programs that hold employers accountable and provide consumers with a means to support ethical practices, according to Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.

For example, the Equitable Food Initiative (EFI) works with farms to certify that produce is grown under safe, fair, and dignified conditions. Participating operations have the opportunity to integrate worker voice, foster collaboration between managers and workers, and recognize the value of all staff.

It's important to recognize that many migrant workers endure abuse and exploitation out of fear of deportation.

Groups like Centro de los Derechos del Migrante (CDM), a transnational organization aiding Mexico-based migrant workers in the U.S., assist migrant workers in confronting these injustices. Ensuring that labor migration policies reflect workers’ voices and priorities, CDM collaborates with workers to transform the power imbalances that harm people in the H-2A and other temporary work visa programs.

Promoting equitable practices in local agriculture and raising awareness about available resources can help safeguard the well-being of these essential community members. We must realize that protecting them is a shared responsibility.

It’s up to us to speak out for those who are too often silenced, even if, at times, it feels like our messages empty into an abyss. We cannot continue to accept the labor of undocumented workers while treating them as disposable. We cannot have a witch hunt and a workforce at the same time.

As someone whose community was once welcomed and rebuilt after war, I believe in this country’s ability to honor the dignity of all workers, regardless of status. We owe it to the people who feed us every day. They deserve more than fear and invisibility. They deserve protection, recognition, and a seat at the table.

Rios, director of American Friends Service Committee’s U.S.-Mexico Border Program, added that the Supreme Court this week legitimized those controversial tactics when it cleared the way for agents to stop people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The Supreme Court on Monday lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that agents were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around Los Angeles.

On this episode of Border Report Live, Rios speaks with correspondent Salvador Rivera about the ruling and its effects on communities in Southern California. Rios said such tactics have been used in the past, and he argues that the ruling will erode the protections that many people have come to expect.

Other immigrant advocacy groups have said the ruling does not uphold the law or make our nation safer.

The El Paso-based Border Network for Human Rights issued a statement, saying Latino communities across the United States are facing an “unprecedented and unconstitutional campaign of abuse that has generated widespread fear and terror.”

“Let us be clear: this is no longer about immigration enforcement,” BNHR said in a statement. “It is state-sanctioned persecution of Latino communities. … It enables racial targeting, tears families apart, and erodes the constitutional protections that safeguard us all from authoritarian rule.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the Supreme Court’s stay “a win for the safety and security of the American people and the rule of law.”

“Our brave @DHSGov law enforcement will continue our operations in LA to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens that pose a danger to public safety,” Noem tweeted on Monday. “Make America Safe Again!”

Donna Hughes-Brown, 58, was arrested by ICE over a bad check for $25 she passed a decade ago, according to her husband. Born in England the grandmother holds Irish citizenship and first came to the U.S. with her parents and brother aged 11.

She visited the Republic of Ireland earlier this summer for a family funeral, only to be arrested when she returned to Chicago O’Hare International Airport on July 29.

She has since been detained for more than 30 days and held at a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, with the U.S. government threatening to deport her over the check, which it argues was a “crime of moral turpitude,” despite her family saying she paid the money back long ago.

There is no statutory definition of moral turpitude but courts have found that it “refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality,” according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Jim Brown – Donna’s husband of eight years, with whom she lives on a nine-acre farm in Troy, Missouri, and with whom she organizes charitable “blessing boxes” for struggling members of the local community – told Fox News’s Nevada affiliate KMOV of his anguish at his wife’s plight.

“It’s just not fair that you’re telling me I have to be a bachelor the rest of my life because of some stupid policy,” Brown said. “You don’t arrest 58-year-old grandmothers. It’s just wrong. She hasn’t committed crimes. You just don’t do that.”

Brown, a U.S. Navy veteran of 20 years’ service, has admitted to Newsweek that he voted for Donald Trump in last year’s presidential election but has quickly come to regret it “100 percent”.

“It’s egregious that we have allowed a government to allow this to happen,” he told KMOV, dismissing the case being made against his wife as “nonsense” and rubbishing the idea that she represents a flight risk. “I think it’s a blanket thing to catch everybody, to fill beds… They signed a stupid bill that is torturing innocent people, and that’s the problem.”

Brown added that he spends hours on the phone every day trying to reach his partner, protesting about the “deplorable” conditions in which she is being held and appealing for help from his state’s elected officials, so far to no avail.

The office of Missouri’s Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe sent him a letter advising him that his wife’s case was a “federal issue” only, he said.

“I want somebody to have the guts and the fortitude to stand up and say, ‘You know what? This is wrong’,” Brown said. “It’s crazy that this is happening. It’s just crazy that this is even allowed in this country. That’s the problem. It shouldn’t even be thought that this should be OK. My wife is not a criminal.”

The Independent has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security has previously said in a statement: “Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with certain criminal convictions may be found inadmissible, placed in removal proceedings, and subject to mandatory detention.

According to CBP, the incident happened on Tuesday at around 7:15 a.m.

Without offering specifics, CBP said that during a migrant smuggling investigation in El Paso, a U.S. Border Patrol Agent ""was involved in a use of force incident"" involving a dog.

CBP stressed that it is taking the matter seriously and said it will provide more information when it becomes available, providing no mention of any migrants being found.

However, KFOX14/CBS4 spoke with a distraught family from the Upper Valley who claimed to have been the victims of this incident and said the agents went into the home and shot and killed their dog.

The father, who wished to remain anonymous, said Border Patrol agents in jeans and t-shirts showed up at his son's home looking for migrants after receiving a tip.

The son answered the door and, while he permitted the agents to search his home, claiming he had nothing to hide, he asked if they could wait first while he put the family dog, Chop, a Rottweiler, away in the bathroom before they walked in, as the dog could be aggressive.

RECOMMENDED:

Border Patrol agents then asked the son if he could show them some identification.

According to the family, it is at this point that the son went to his pickup truck to retrieve his ID and a Border Patrol agent entered the home and, as a result, ended up shooting the dog.

The family stressed that the agents knew-- the son had told them-- that Chop was put in the bathroom for their safety and that the agents opened the door, let Chop out and shot him.

The family appeared upset and disgusted by the agent's actions, saying that they were following orders and trying to be upstanding citizens, only for an agent to kill ""a family member.""

Furthermore, the family said none of the Border Patrol agents helped the family, who desperately tried to render aid to the dog, which bled to death on the kitchen floor.

WATCH:

Also, the family claims the agent who shot their dog then hid from them and refused to give his name.

The family said it is looking to pursue legal action and expressed concern that something like this could happen to other families.

The family added that when they confronted agents, Border Patrol reportedly told them they were working from an anonymous tip tied to the previous owners of the home, who lived there two years ago.

CBP's full statement:

On Sept. 9 at 7:15 a.m., a U.S. Border Patrol agent was involved in a use of force incident in El Paso, Texas during an investigation into alien smuggling at a residence. The incident involved a canine. The use of force is currently under review by CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility in accordance with CBP policies. CBP takes such incidents seriously. We will provide additional information as it becomes available.

Some 475 employees, including 300 South Koreans, were taken into custody Thursday at the Savannah-area battery plant. Videos released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials showed the detained workers in shackles and chains. The raid shocked Seoul, a key U.S. ally, where people expressed a sense of betrayal by Washington.

The facility was part of a $4.3 billion joint venture that was slated for completion later this year. It was expected to create 8,500 jobs that would support the car company’s nearby electric vehicle plan, but construction on the factory was put on pause after the raid.

Work on at least 22 other factory sites with ties to South Korea has also been halted, reported The Korean Economic Daily. Those facilities are involved in industries related to automobiles, shipbuilding, steel, and electrical equipment.

South Korean companies with U.S. business interests have canceled travel plans and recalled their U.S.-based staff, fearing that their employees could be affected by more raids.

“Korean workers are being treated like criminals for building factories that Washington itself lobbied for,” a company executive in Seoul told the business newspaper. “If this continues, investment in the U.S. could be reconsidered.”

President Donald Trump defended the raid, claiming Friday that the employees were in the U.S. “illegally” and that U.S. companies needed to focus on training their American employees in order to do the jobs they would otherwise outsource.

An immigration attorney representing several of the detained South Koreans, Charles Kuck, told the Associated Press that the president’s statement wasn’t just wrong—as many of the workers were authorized to work under the B-1 business visitor visa program—but was basically unfeasible in the short term, as no U.S. companies make the machines utilized at the Georgia factory.

“They had to come from abroad to install or repair equipment on-site—work that would take about three to five years to train someone in the U.S. to do,” the AP reported.

Industry officials in Seoul have warned that the projects—collectively worth more than $101 billion—could face serious delays or be placed on indefinite hiatus unless Washington agrees to bilateral talks for new visa arrangements for South Korean employees.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_republic_521/4ed80a40f14492ecbc79165333892cf6,N,,2025-09-11 01:57:23.371818

Mr. Trump has yet to nominate a new candidate to lead the bureau.
And he has been nominated against the backdrop of an all-out push by President Trump to remake the central bank’s top ranks after months of withering attacks.

She said that was especially true at a moment when Mr. Trump had sought to browbeat the Fed into lowering interest rates.","Though it failed, Mr. Schumer’s proposal brought the contentious debate over the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, which has roiled the House, to the chamber that has largely avoided it.

Republicans in both bodies have sought to avoid a politically precarious vote on the Epstein files. President Trump has dismissed concerns over the Epstein files as a “Democratic hoax” and urged his right-wing supporters to move on, but his administration’s handling of the issue has inflamed many in the right-wing base.

Though lawmakers hoped the issue would die down over their August recess, it was revived this week when a key House committee released a note and sexually suggestive drawing addressed to Mr. Epstein that contained what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s signature.

Mr. Schumer proposed his Epstein measure as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill and then, using a maneuver available to him as the minority leader, teed up a procedural vote.

“If Republicans vote no, you’ll be saying to the American people that they should not see the Epstein files,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “I ask my Republican colleagues: After all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, told reporters that Mr. Schumer’s measure was a “stunt” and promised to dispense with it. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to table it.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she opposed Mr. Schumer’s measure because it was unrelated to the attached defense bill. “It does not belong on the Department of Defense policy bill,” she said.

Mr. Schumer was not the first Democrat to try to force the Epstein issue through the Senate. But other efforts, including two from Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona and one from Jeff Merkley of Oregon, used different procedures that allowed them to be defeated without Republicans recording votes.

Mr. Schumer’s proposal was similar to a bipartisan resolution introduced in the House by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ro Khanna of California. The pair appear within weeks of being able to force a vote on their measure on the House floor, a move that would require the signatures of 218 House members on what is known as a discharge petition.

Their effort got a boost on Wednesday night, when Representative James Walkinshaw, Democrat of Virginia, was sworn in after winning a special election. Mr. Walkinshaw has vowed to sign the petition, which would bring the number of signatories to 217.

“Given the large amount of sensitive data under S.S.A.’s control, I consider the protection and security” of the information “to be a matter of first importance,” Mr. Crapo wrote.

The letter signaled that Republicans were examining the allegations made by Mr. Borges. He sat down last week with Republican and Democratic staff members of the Finance Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session.

In his whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Borges said that members of the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. The database contained records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, in addition to names, addresses and other details that could be used to steal identities.

Mr. Borges said that DOGE had bypassed the “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data, putting it at risk of being leaked or hacked.

Mr. Crapo’s letter was addressed to Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration. It asked him for information about how the agency had responded to Mr. Borges’s concerns, and whether it had followed normal risk-assessment protocols in allowing DOGE to copy the data to the server. The agency was asked to respond by Sept. 23.

Andrea Meza, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower group representing Mr. Borges, said in a statement that she welcomed Mr. Crapo’s letter as an “initial step.”

But she said it did not go far enough in seeking answers about the specifics of Mr. Borges’s complaint. She pointed out that Mr. Crapo was not seeking documents from the agency.

“Later this week, we will provide Congress with a recommended list of records to request that would offer far more insight than any self-assessment by the agency accused of wrongdoing,” Ms. Meza said. “If everything was proper, those documents reviewed by an independent investigator will show it.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint, which was first reported by The New York Times, did not indicate that the server set up by DOGE had been breached. A Social Security Administration spokesman said that the agency was not “aware of any compromise” to the database and that it was “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

Mr. Borges resigned three days after submitting his complaint, saying the agency had made it “impossible” for him to perform his duties “legally and ethically.”

Democrats on the Finance Committee this week called for Mr. Crapo to hold a hearing about Mr. Borges’s allegations and the broader state of Social Security. The agency was thrown into turmoil by Elon Musk, then the leader of DOGE, and his team of young software engineers, who advanced false claims of widespread fraud as they sought extraordinary power over closely guarded data.

Taylor Harvey, a spokesman for the Democratic members of the committee, said Mr. Crapo had not yet responded to their request for a hearing.

The admission came after lawyers representing the children produced a report by the Guatemalan attorney general’s office that included interviews with 115 parents refuting the idea.

The hearing on Wednesday came in a case initially focused on more than 600 Guatemalan children who had entered the United States without a parent or guardian. The Trump administration had planned to hastily repatriate dozens of them on flights over the Labor Day weekend.

During an emergency hearing to stop the planes on Aug. 31, lawyers representing the children told Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee who received the case during the holiday, that many feared for their safety in Guatemala and were doing everything possible to stay in the United States.

Many of the children, their lawyers argued, were loaded onto planes despite pending immigration proceedings and without any chance to challenge the repatriation. The children have been in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement.

During the Labor Day weekend emergency hearing, the Justice Department insisted the government was working with Guatemalan authorities to reunite families that had been torn apart, and acting on the wishes of the parents.

“The United States government is trying to facilitate the return of these children to their parents or guardians, from whom they have been separated,” said Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government.

Senior Trump administration officials echoed those claims.

Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Trump and the architect of his immigration policy, said on social media last week that the children had been “orphaned” and, after Judge Sooknanan’s ruling, that “a Democrat judge is refusing to let them reunify with their parents.”

During the hearing on Wednesday, Judge Timothy R. Kelly, a Trump appointee who has now been assigned to formally oversee the case, grilled a Justice Department attorney about the Guatemalan attorney general’s report.

The report cited 115 relatives contacted by Guatemalan officials who uniformly disputed that they had requested the return of their children. It mentioned one group of 50 parents who said they would welcome their children home but had hoped to see them stay in the United States. Another 59 rejected, “sometimes in an intimidating manner,” officials’ attempts to reach them, the report said, because they believed their children had been cleared to remain in the United States and refused to encourage their repatriation.

“It should be noted that in one of the reports, the parents stated that if their daughter were to return, they would do everything possible to get her out of the country again, because she had received death threats and therefore could not live in this country,” the report stated.

In sworn declarations filed in the case, several Guatemalan children said they faced neglect, violence at the hands of gangs or racial discrimination and wished to remain in relative safety in the United States.

Judge Kelly noted on Wednesday that the Guatemalan government had been unable to locate a “huge chunk” of the parents, and among those they did locate, none had requested that their children be returned. “So I guess my first question is, you don’t contest what that report lays out?” he asked the Justice Department lawyers.

Sarah Welch, a Justice Department lawyer, told Judge Kelly that the government had no better information than what was contained in the report and therefore would withdraw its claim that families of the children had requested their return.

“I don’t have anything specific that I can refer to to contest the Guatemalan A.G.’s report, so that’s ‘no’ to that question at this point,” Ms. Welch said.

Lawyers for the children asked Judge Kelly on Wednesday to create a class encompassing children of other nationalities, whom they argued the Trump administration had similar plans to repatriate. In their lawsuit, the lawyers representing the children said they had evidence that the agreement with Guatemala was a “pilot program” that the government hoped to replicate with other countries.

The lawyers also asked for a temporary halt on deportations of any unaccompanied children in a similar position until the court could address the legality of the plan.

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment about the government’s position, referring questions to the State Department.

In a news conference after the hearing, Efrén Olivares, a vice president at the National Immigration Law Center, said the government had shown it would do whatever necessary to expel migrants, even in cases involving children.

“That is remarkable to me,” he said. “The government keeps changing their story.”

Rather, in rejecting South Carolina’s request to bar the student from the boys’ bathroom for now, the order said the state had not cleared the high bar for securing an emergency ruling in its favor.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch noted dissents but did not offer reasons.

The state’s lawyers told the justices that the challenged law was “supported by recent actions of the current presidential administration,” including orders signed by President Trump putting federal funding at risk if schools do not designate bathrooms for use based on biological sex.

Alexandra Brodsky, a lawyer with Public Justice, a legal advocacy group that represents the student, welcomed the ruling.

“Today’s decision from the Supreme Court reaffirms what we all know to be true: Contrary to South Carolina’s insistence, trans students are not emergencies,” she said in a statement. “They are not threats.”

Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general, said the ruling was a temporary and limited setback.

“While we are disappointed in the court’s decision today, we respect the process and will comply with the ruling,” he said in a statement. “This ruling only creates an exception for one student. The state’s bathroom law remains in full effect for everyone else. We may have lost this battle, but we believe we will ultimately win the war.”

The Supreme Court has addressed transgender rights in other contexts, ruling in 2020 that a federal civil rights law protects transgender workers while upholding in June a Tennessee law prohibiting some medical treatments for transgender youth. In the term that starts next month, the court will consider two cases testing the constitutionality of state laws that bar transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams.

The South Carolina case involves a 14-year-old student, identified in court papers as John Doe. He challenged the state’s bathroom law, first adopted in 2024, saying it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause and Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs that receive federal money.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit last month ordered school officials to let the student use the boys’ bathroom while the litigation is pending, saying that one of its precedents required it.

“Doe is a 14-year-old student who simply wishes to use the restroom,” Judge Albert Diaz, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote in a concurring opinion. “Doing so is a biological necessity. Doing so in restrooms that match his gender identity is his right under our precedent.”

In a second concurring opinion, Judge G. Steven Agee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that he believed the appeals court’s precedent was wrong but binding. “One can only hope,” he wrote, quoting an earlier opinion, “that the Supreme Court will take the opportunity with all deliberate speed to resolve these questions of national importance.”

In that 2020 precedent, Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, the appeals court ruled that a Virginia school had violated the Constitution and Title IX when it refused to allow Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy, to use the boys’ restroom. The Supreme Court in 2021 refused to hear the state’s appeal, over the dissents of Justices Thomas and Alito.

In the South Carolina case, lawyers for the state filed an emergency application urging the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the legal landscape had changed with its decision in June in United States v. Skrmetti, which upheld a Tennessee law banning some medical treatments for transgender minors.

The South Carolina law, the application said, represents a “considered judgment about the harms of allowing male students to use female restrooms and vice versa.”

“After much debate,"" it went on, “lawmakers chose to protect privacy and safety for students. The Fourth Circuit ignored the people’s judgment and failed to defer to the public interest in favor of the preferences of one student.”

In response, lawyers for the student wrote that the Supreme Court had better things to do with its time than rule on a case affecting a single ninth-grade child.

When the Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in favor of transgender rights in the workplace, Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the ruling was limited.

“We do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms or anything else of the kind,” he wrote then.

If finalized, the proposal would advance what President Trump has termed his “drill, baby, drill” agenda. It also would herald a major shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public lands, which make up about one-tenth of the country.

“The previous administration’s Public Lands Rule had the potential to block access to hundreds of thousands of acres of multiple-use land — preventing energy and mineral production, timber management, grazing and recreation across the West,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement on Wednesday.

Repealing the rule, Mr. Burgum said, “protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on.”

The Bureau of Land Management, sometimes called the nation’s largest landlord, has for decades offered leases for the development of public lands, including for oil drilling and cattle ranching. But some of these activities have fragmented and destroyed critical habitat for wildlife. At the same time, climate change has fueled more frequent and more severe wildfires and drought across the American West.

The Biden-era rule, which was finalized in April 2024, sought to put conservation on equal footing with development for the first time since the Bureau of Land Management was established in 1946. It allowed the agency to offer two new types of leases for the restoration of degraded lands and for offsetting environmental damage.

Several Republican-led states and industry groups assailed the rule as a land grab and challenged it in federal court. On Wednesday, they applauded the Trump administration’s proposal to scrap the regulation.

“The Biden administration unlawfully placed conservation above all else,” Rich Nolan, the president and chief executive of the National Mining Association, said in a statement. “This new rule reinstates the balance of federal land use intended by Congress, ensuring that our vast resources can meet today’s soaring energy needs and become the secure mineral supply chains for American industry.”

Conservation groups sharply criticized the announcement, which came as Mr. Burgum spoke at Gastech, an energy industry conference in Milan.

“If Secretary Burgum spent more time in the West, he’d understand how conservation fits into everything the Bureau of Land Management does,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement.

“Hunters, anglers, hikers and backpackers all praised the public lands rule because it helps ensure access to public lands for future generations,” Ms. Rokala said. “Public lands management is a balancing act, and you just tipped the scales back to the 19th century, when robber barons ran the country, exploiting our lands for personal gain.”

In Milan, Mr. Burgum alluded to “deals that are being signed” with other countries to purchase more liquefied natural gas from the United States. He also declared that artificial intelligence was a more pressing concern than global warming.

“What’s going to save the planet is winning the A.I. arms race,” he said. “We need power to do that and we need it now.”

Mr. Trump in February nominated Kathleen Sgamma, then the head of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry trade group, to lead the Bureau of Land Management. But Ms. Sgamma abruptly withdrew her nomination in April, just as her confirmation hearing was about to begin.

Trump administration officials asked Ms. Sgamma to withdraw after learning of a 2021 letter in which she criticized the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a pro-Trump mob, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Mr. Trump has yet to nominate a new candidate to lead the bureau.

The inspector general’s office announced the review in a memo addressed to the statistics agency’s acting commissioner, William J. Wiatrowski, a longtime civil servant. The memo cites the agency’s cutting back on its collection of data related to inflation statistics, as well as recent large downward revisions to jobs figures.

The assistant inspector general who sent the letter, Laura Nicolosi, was appointed to that position in early January, before Mr. Trump took office and fired the Labor Department’s inspector general. The acting deputy inspector general is now serving as the agency’s top official.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has long acknowledged that falling survey response rates and other trends have made it harder to measure the state of the U.S. economy. But experts inside and outside the agency say its efforts to address those challenges have been stymied by a lack of resources. Mr. Trump’s proposed budget would make further cuts.

On Tuesday, the agency said employers had added close to one million fewer jobs in late 2024 and early 2025 than previously reported. That followed a series of unusually large downward adjustments to monthly employment figures.

Big revisions are more common during turning points in the labor market, including when the economy is tipping into a recession. Businesses that take a few months to respond to the surveys are sometimes the ones having the most trouble. But on the whole, revisions have gotten smaller over time.

The report could add heft to the White House’s efforts to get Mr. Antoni confirmed. Mr. Antoni, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, has long been critical of the agency’s output, including on a podcast that aired shortly before his nomination was announced. In it, Mr. Antoni levied several vague criticisms of the bureau’s survey collection methodology and data analysis.

“I think you really need a complete overhaul at the B.L.S.,” he said. “You need to take a long hard look at the models that they’re using, and make sure things are actually modeled to reflect reality today, not just a time in the past.”

Ms. McEntarfer has continued to defend the agency’s work in posts on social media since her firing.

“The big story here is of an agency of dedicated statisticians and public servants working tirelessly to improve economic data in a climate of budgetary cuts to data collection,” she wrote on Tuesday. “They have been very innovative in meeting that mandate. But we should also just fund our economic infrastructure.”

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is expected to hold a hearing on Mr. Antoni’s nomination in the coming weeks. Economists from across the political spectrum have panned the choice, noting several instances in which he appeared to misunderstand the nature of the statistics he would oversee.

Mr. Miran’s journey to join the Fed has been unusual from the start.

He was tapped to fill what could be one of the shortest stints on the Board of Governors after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from the Fed last month. He has moved through the confirmation process at warp speed as Republican lawmakers try to get him seated ahead of the Fed’s vote on interest rates next week. And he has been nominated against the backdrop of an all-out push by President Trump to remake the central bank’s top ranks after months of withering attacks.

But perhaps the biggest break with tradition involves Mr. Miran’s stated plans to remain tied to the White House while he serves at the Fed. Rather than resign his post advising the president on economic policy as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Miran said, he would instead take a unpaid leave of absence. That would enable him to return to the administration once his term at the central bank was complete.

The arrangement has raised the specter that Mr. Miran may feel beholden to Mr. Trump and unwilling to support policy actions that, while good for the economy, would be politically problematic for the president who employs him. Some former White House officials, legal experts, economists and Democratic lawmakers warned that confirming Mr. Miran under these circumstances could set a dangerous precedent undermining the Fed’s longstanding independence.

“It’s obviously inappropriate and very concerning in terms of his ability to operate independently,” said Glenn Hubbard, who served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers — the same post held by Mr. Miran — during the George W. Bush administration.

The vote is a win for the White House, which was dealt a blow late Tuesday in its efforts to oust Lisa Cook, a Fed governor who has been accused by the president of committing mortgage fraud despite never having been charged or convicted of a crime.

A federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from removing Ms. Cook while she contests her recent dismissal, allowing her to stay on as an active governor in the interim. In her ruling, Judge Jia Cobb said that the president had not established sufficient cause to remove a Fed official, a threshold that she interpreted to mean conduct that occurred while in office and related to the duties of the job.

The Trump administration on Wednesday signaled it would appeal that ruling, suggesting this will be the first step in what could become a drawn-out legal battle. If Ms. Cook loses, Mr. Trump will have yet another opportunity to add more policymakers partial to his point of view to the Fed.

“Donald Trump is full speed ahead in trying to take over the Fed,” warned Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat from Massachusetts, in an interview Wednesday.

The White House declined repeatedly this week to answer specific questions about Mr. Miran’s planned leave of absence from the White House, fanning fears that he will remain closely tied to the administration throughout his tenure at the Fed. “Based on legal guidance, if confirmed, Stephen Miran may take an unpaid leave of absence from his C.E.A. position,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.

But Mr. Miran offered a few new details about his planned leave in correspondence with Ms. Warren which she released ahead of his confirmation vote.

If he is confirmed by the full Senate, Mr. Miran’s term with the Fed will last until January, though he could remain in that role until Mr. Trump secured a successor. Asked if he would commit to resigning once the term expired, Mr. Miran said “no,” signaling to the senator that he would not automatically depart.

The comment suggested that Mr. Miran was open to his term’s lasting longer than four months, since it could take time for the president to identify a new governor, or Mr. Miran himself could be considered for other positions within the central bank.

But Mr. Miran did tell Ms. Warren that he could “re-evaluate” his leave of absence from the White House in the event of a longer appointment. While on leave, Mr. Miran said, he would not “maintain access” to his White House email, but would continue to consult with the Council of Economic Advisers “to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed.” He did not explicitly agree to disclose any conversations he has with the president beyond what may be required by law.

“That’s not independence; that’s servitude,” Ms. Warren said of the arrangement, adding that Mr. Miran would make decisions “with an eye toward the question of whether Donald Trump will approve or disapprove.”

Mr. Trump has made no secret about his desire to see a more compliant central bank that will acquiesce to his demands to lower borrowing costs. The Fed has kept interest rates steady for months in a bid to keep inflation under control. The president has even bragged that he is on the precipice of clinching a majority of support on the powerful board, which Mr. Miran could be the next to join.

Mr. Trump may have yet another opportunity to appoint a board member if he is successful in ousting Ms. Cook, another governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud. And the president will get to appoint a new Fed chair to replace Jerome H. Powell once his term ends in May.

In his advisory role at the White House, which similarly required Senate confirmation, Mr. Miran has echoed some of the president’s attacks on the Fed. He has also helped to produce favorable economic research for Mr. Trump, particularly to make the case that his punishing global tariffs would not cause prices to rise.

Mr. Miran revealed his intentions to stay on at the White House at a confirmation hearing last week, as he sought to head off questions about his ability to resist the president’s pressure. He said he had “received advice from counsel” that he could retain his post at the Council of Economic Advisers on an unpaid basis, citing the fact that the appointment to the Fed may span only about four months.

By taking a leave of absence, Mr. Miran would essentially preserve his ties to that position, while taking on a critical central banking role affording him a powerful vote over the nation’s economic trajectory. If confirmed, he would be able to influence the debate over interest rates, weigh in on the rules and regulations imposed on Wall Street and set priorities for the staff.

Many congressional Democrats reacted coolly to Mr. Miran’s plans, pointing to the fact that he personally had endorsed the idea of closing the “revolving door” between the Fed and the executive branch.

“You’re going to be an employee of the president of the United States on leave,” warned Senator Jack Reed, Democrat from Rhode Island, during last week’s hearing. He added that Mr. Trump could just call up Mr. Miran and say, “Here, I want you to do this, this and this.”

Mr. Reed said on Wednesday that Democrats on the committee had requested further details from the White House on the legality of the arrangement but had not yet heard back.

“We are still completely uncertain as to his legal status, and his independence, which is critical, as a member of the Federal Reserve board,” Mr. Reed said, pledging that his colleagues would “press further” on the issue.

Some experts also questioned the legality of Mr. Miran’s arrangement, given the strict ethics requirements imposed on Fed governors — who, among other restrictions, must devote their “entire time” to the board and its business.

“It ought to be disqualifying,” said Kathryn Judge, a top law professor at Columbia University who studies financial markets and regulation.

Ms. Judge said the Fed’s founding law does not address “directly” whether someone like Mr. Miran could essentially preserve his position at the White House while serving on the central bank. But she said Congress did not intend that arrangement when it chartered the system and imposed numerous guardrails in 1935.

“Given the thoughtfulness of those design features, it seems clear Congress expected meaningful independence,” Ms. Judge added, warning later that any attempt to compromise the institution could pose “incredible dangers” to the economy.

Lisa Gilbert, a co-president of Public Citizen, a watchdog group, said Mr. Miran’s continued relationship with the White House would be “completely inconsistent” with that vision. She said that was especially true at a moment when Mr. Trump had sought to browbeat the Fed into lowering interest rates.

“The Trump administration has consistently tried to apply pressure to the Fed,” Ms. Gilbert said, adding that “this kind of dual role seems inherently problematic when we already understand the pressure they’re attempting to bring to bear on this independent entity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/10/multimedia/10trump-news-promo-830pm/10trump-news-epstein-files-hmgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 20:56:42.370945

The ministry said it was talking with US officials about letting the plane return home with the released workers as soon as possible. But it said the plane cannot depart from the US on Wednesday, as South Korea had hoped, due to an unspecified reason involving the United States authorities.

Before meeting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said that he aimed to bring the workers home as quickly as possible.

A total of 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Koreans, were rounded up in the September 4 raid at the battery factory under construction at Hyundai’s sprawling car plant west of Savannah.

Some were shown being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and waists in a video released by US authorities. Many of the detained workers are employees of subcontractors involved in the project.

The US Department of State did not mention the immigration issue in a readout of Rubio’s meeting with Cho, but it mentioned that Rubio said Washington welcomed South Korean investment and that the two discussed promoting a fair and reciprocal trade partnership.

It said they also discussed expanding “equitable defense burden sharing,” a reference to US calls for Seoul to pay more for the presence of US troops in South Korea.

The workplace raid by the US Homeland Security agency was its largest yet as it pursues its mass deportation agenda.

The Georgia battery plant, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States.

Representatives of Korean companies, including Hyundai Motor and LG, urged their government to negotiate with the US for a new type of visa for Korean professionals and to get clearer visa guidelines to reduce uncertainty and support their businesses in the United States, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

Korean businesses have complained about strict US limits on visas for skilled foreign workers, which they say make it difficult for them to oversee the construction of factories or to train the local workforce.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25253550955253-1-1757522144.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-10 21:56:44.481322

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “At noon today, I convened the heads of Israel’s security organizations and authorized a surgical precision strike on the terrorist chiefs of Hamas. These are the same terrorists who planned — terrorist chiefs who planned, launched and celebrated the horrific massacres of October 7th.”

Einav Zangauker, the mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, condemned Netanyahu for the attack in Qatar.

Anyone who deliberately chooses to endanger my child’s life is murdering him. Why does the prime minister insist on blowing up every small chance for a deal? Why?”

World leaders condemned the strike, including from France, Germany, Britain and the European Union. Germany’s chancellor called Israel’s attack on Qatar “unacceptable,” adding, “The war must not spread to the entire region.”

The president of the United Arab Emirates arrived in Qatar today. Jordan’s Crown Prince Hussein is also set to visit. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to visit tomorrow.

The White House said that it warned Qatar prior to the attack, but Qatar said it only received notice from the U.S. as its capital was being hit by Israeli strikes. Speaking to reporters yesterday, President Trump said that he was “very unhappy” about Israel’s attack. On social media, Trump wrote, “I view Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the U.S., and feel very badly about the location of the attack.”

Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said yesterday that Qatar’s mediation efforts were central to its identity and that the Israeli attack would not deter its diplomatic role.

Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani: “The Israeli attack that took place today on Qatari soil, we cannot call it anything other than state terrorism practiced by someone like Netanyahu in the context of these systematic policies and his ongoing attempts that have destabilized regional security and stability. It’s simply a clear message to the region as a whole.”

Israel continues to bombard Gaza City, ordering the full evacuation of the city’s residents to the so-called safe zone of al-Mawasi. Around 800,000 Palestinians are already sheltering in al-Mawasi, which Israel has targeted at least 109 times, killing over 2,000 people, according to Gaza’s Government Media Office. Residents in Gaza City say they have no safe place to go.

Mahmoud Ad-Dabbs: “We are attempting to delay death a little longer. We have been displaced approximately 30 times, moving from one death to another, but we are trying to postpone death a little. What is the fault of these children? Why is this happening to this child and that one? O Arabs, Muslims, negotiators, please find a solution for us in any possible manner.”

Al Jazeera is reporting that Israeli attacks have killed 20 Palestinians in Gaza today, including 15 displaced people sheltering in tents west of Gaza City. In the past 24 hours, five more Palestinians have starved to death, including one child.

Meanwhile, a BBC investigation has found that members of an anti-Islam biker gang, the Infidels Motorcycle Club, are working in Gaza for UG Solutions, which is providing armed security for the shadowy U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. According to the United Nations, 1,135 Palestinians have been killed seeking food near GHF aid sites.

If local governments choose to participate in the 287(g) program, despite community opposition, they can put limits and oversight on how local law enforcement is supporting federal deportation agents and how this impacts community members.","The Trump administration is quietly using a program called 287(g) to turn local police and sheriff’s departments into arms of its deportation machine.

In the coming weeks, the Trump administration is likely to hit a milestone of 1,000 participating state and local agencies in at least 40 states. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aggressively recruiting for this deportation-collaboration program. It is now offering cash to local police in exchange for “locating” our immigrant neighbors, as it attempts to reach a level of deportations never before seen in our nation’s history.

President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to remove 20 million people from the country. That's 5.8 percent of our population. This ambitious project – most visible in the masked deportation squads that are smashing car windows and forcing people into black vans – is likely to grow even more nefarious as ICE leeches on to local police to help it.

How Local Police Become Deportation Assistants

The 287(g) Program is a set of partnerships between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and state and local agencies that effectively turns local officials into ICE agents, authorizing selected officers to identify, arrest, and process certain people for immigration enforcement and ultimately deportation.

Local law enforcement participating in the 287(g) program are redeployed from local public safety matters to be an ICE force multiplier. This could include interrogating anyone they believe to be a noncitizen about their right to be in the country and asking for their citizenship papers. It could mean that local jails continue to hold people – grandparents, caretakers and other long-time residents who lack legal status – beyond when they would otherwise be released after a minor infraction or posting bail until ICE comes to take them away. Local police officers become secretaries for ICE - doing paperwork and helping process people for deportations.

Many law enforcement leaders oppose 287(g) because it is a drain on local resources. It not only wastes police officers’ time, it also has led to costly lawsuits for constitutional rights violations, including wrongly holding US citizens. Numerous studies show that this program hurts public safety. People are less likely to come forward to seek police protection when they know calling 911 could result in their family member or friend being deported.

At the end of Barack Obama’s administration, there were just 32 participating state and local law enforcement agencies. That leapt to 152 in Trump’s first term, and the administration removed guardrails like expiration dates for participation agreements.

Joe Biden’s administration left the program largely intact, refusing to kick out participating law enforcement agencies with records of racial profiling and anti-immigrant abuse, despite calls from the ACLU and our partners.

Now, in just eight months of the second Trump administration, the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent. The program has encroached into states that until now had few or no participating agencies, such as Iowa, Maine, New Mexico, Utah, and West Virginia.

287(g) Program Expands in Dangerous New Ways

Congress first authorized 287(g) in 1996, permitting the federal government to delegate certain federal immigration enforcement responsibilities to designated state and local officers, subject to training and close supervision by federal officials. Now, just as the Trump administration has moved to exploit other long-standing legal authorities, it has gone far beyond what Congress intended and morphed this program into a larger, cannibalizing force, the full implications of which we have yet to see.

In the coming months, we expect ICE to tap local police to join its multi-agency, masked deportation squads across the country. Already, in April, ICE boasted a “first-of-its-kind statewide operation” involving ICE and more than a dozen sheriff’s offices, the state of Florida, the FBI and other federal agencies. Blurring law enforcement agencies into a single, unaccountable deportation force is a recipe for civil rights abuses and government waste.

ICE has also illegally relied on 287(g) to detain people at the notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a hastily constructed facility in the middle of the Florida Everglades, which is surrounded by alligators, snakes, mosquitos, and swampland. The ACLU and our partners recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of people detained there.

ICE has also penned agreements with state National Guards in Texas, Florida and West Virginia. It has tapped campus police departments and even agencies that are not law enforcement-oriented, like the Florida Department of Lottery Services.

Our Communities Are Fighting Back

We are seeing vocal opposition to agreements under consideration in communities nationwide. At a July meeting in\Utah County, Utah “the vast majority” of public input during a commission meeting on a 287(g) agreement was opposed – citing racial profiling, the risk of unidentified ICE agents, and “religious values of loving their neighbors.” In Miami, Florida, lines of people gathered hours before the meeting and delivered hours passionate public comments against the city joining the program. In Camden, Delaware, the city quietly approved an agreement and then backtracked and withdrew after robust public opposition. This led to the state passing legislation to ban these agreements state-wide.

If local governments choose to participate in the 287(g) program, despite community opposition, they can put limits and oversight on how local law enforcement is supporting federal deportation agents and how this impacts community members.

We expect demands for transparency and accountability to grow in the coming weeks and months – the longer we all witness the violence of the masked deportation squads, the more opposition to them will grow.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/police-ice-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 17:56:58.168109

The CBO found that 290,000 immigrants could be removed through those measures, and an additional 30,000 people could leave the U.S. voluntarily.
It cautioned that its population projections are “highly uncertain,” but estimated that the U.S. will have 367 million people in 2055.
Lower immigration to the U.S. could have implications for the nation's economy and the government's budget.
“Deaths are projected to exceed births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected,” it noted.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's plans for mass deportations and other hardline immigration measures will result in roughly 320,000 people removed from the United States over the next ten years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday in a report that also projected that the U.S. population will grow more slowly than it had previously projected.

Donald Trump's tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, included roughly $150 billion to ramp up his mass deportation agenda over the next four years. This includes funding for everything from an extension of the United States’ southern border wall to detention centers and thousands of additional law enforcement staff. The CBO found that 290,000 immigrants could be removed through those measures, and an additional 30,000 people could leave the U.S. voluntarily.

Coupled with a lower fertility rate in the U.S., the reduction in immigration means that the CBO's projection of the U.S. population will be 4.5 million people lower by 2035 than the nonpartisan office had projected in January. It cautioned that its population projections are “highly uncertain,” but estimated that the U.S. will have 367 million people in 2055.

Lower immigration to the U.S. could have implications for the nation's economy and the government's budget. The report did not directly address those issues, but it noted that the projected population would have “fewer people ages 25 to 54 — the age group that is most likely to participate in the labor force — than the agency previously projected.”

Democrats in Congress have been warning that mass deportations could harm the U.S. economy and lead to higher prices on groceries and other goods.

In the White House, Trump has said he wants to see a “baby boom” in the U.S. and his administration has bandied about ideas for encouraging Americans to have more children. But the CBO found no indication that would happen.

“Deaths are projected to exceed births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected,” it noted.

If you go and ask more questions, they could suddenly be violating the human rights of those individuals,” Perez said.
Finding family members Family members of those who were detained in Cato, were unable to locate their loved ones for days.
“Those are the types of things that ICE is doing, and all his family is here in Central New York.
This type of change is meant to confuse family members and those detained, Perez said.","A Syracuse-based immigration attorney handling a half-dozen cases after ICE raided a food factory in Cayuga County last week says information he received from his clients doesn’t line up with what the U.S. attorney told reporters on Tuesday.

“I have six clients that were already my clients [that were detained in the raid], that had work permits, that had everything legally in place to not be detained, and they were taken anyways,” Jose Perez said.

During a press conference Tuesday, acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone said they detained 57 people who were “unlawfully present” in the U.S. and working at Nutrition Bar Confectioners in Cato.

“For people that had court [dates] already scheduled, people that had working permits legally issued, people that had pending cases with [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]"" he said in an interview. “We have clients that were actually able to provide ICE — during the raid — with that information that they were our clients, and [ICE] just didn’t care,” Perez said.

During the Tuesday press conference, Sarcone said five face felony federal charges and the 52 others who were detained were ""on their way back to their countries of origin.”

“They waived their rights. They said, ‘We’ll go home,’” Sarcone responded.

However, Perez, whose five other clients do not face felony charges, said they were still in the U.S. as of Tuesday.

One of his clients was removed from the United States and sent back to Guatemala despite having a pending case.

“We have not seen that in 18 years of immigration practice,” Perez said.

Perez said that unless his client was presented with papers and not informed of what they were, the man didn’t waive his right to a hearing. The client has been in the U.S. for 14 years, has three children here and is married to a U.S. citizen. Prior to being detained, the client was required to go to Immigration and Customs Enforcement every month to check in with the agency.

“He just went two weeks ago, and then he gets detained and removed in 48 hours. That’s what is crazy about this,” Perez said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story.

In addition to the lives his clients have built in the U.S., many of them would face violence if they were to return to their home countries.

“We’re talking about people from Venezuela, from Cuba, that if they return, they’re going to be killed, they’re going to be incarcerated or they’ll disappear,” Perez said. “In those countries, we have people that have been fleeing from gang violence, from domestic violence, and if you remove them, you’re going to get them killed.”

Pressure on businesses

Sarcone emphasized that business owners who knowingly hire people without legal status also will face repercussions.

“We will aggressively pursue criminal investigations against those who violate our laws by employing non-citizens without authorization. There will be consequences,” Sarcone said.

However, for employers the process is not that simple when balancing checking paperwork with illegally discriminating against an employee, Perez said.

“Employers would make sure that they have the correct paperwork, that they have the proper authorization, but they cannot go beyond reviewing the I-9 form and making sure that they have a Social Security card as well as a work permit. If you go and ask more questions, they could suddenly be violating the human rights of those individuals,” Perez said.

Finding family members

Family members of those who were detained in Cato, were unable to locate their loved ones for days. Perez said they are not put into the system quick enough for anyone to keep track of them. It’s a process, he said, that can take up to three days.

“If you’re taking the right person, if you’re fingerprinting them right there, why are you not going to provide information to the family, to the people that can actually look online, or even the attorney?” Perez said. “Sometimes we have clients that are lost that we don’t find in the system.”

Perez had one client scheduled to have a hearing Tuesday in Batavia but was instead moved to Tacoma, Wash., forcing him to miss the hearing.

“Those are the types of things that ICE is doing, and all his family is here in Central New York. Why are they going to move them to Washington? So they don’t have access to their family? So they get desperate and sign a self-deport issue then they are just gone?” Perez said.

This type of change is meant to confuse family members and those detained, Perez said.

Spectrum News 1 has followed the story of a man whose fiancée was detained in Cato. Neither are represented by Perez. On Monday evening, the man was told his fiancée would return home with an ankle monitor the next day. However, when he went to Niagara Falls on Tuesday in hopes of getting more answers, he was told she may not get to be released — but rather sent to another facility in the Louisiana.

News10NBC’s crew at the scene on Westminster Road saw a U.S. Border Patrol car and IRS personnel. Our crew also saw apparent roofing contractors working on the house. Protesters say they’re concerned that the agents are targeting those contractors.

We spoke to one woman Katie Tobin who first spotted the agents and made the calls to local advocacy organizations. The woman told us she asked the agents who they were, and she claims they told her they were ICE agents.

“And I was like ‘Are you ICE?’ And they were very polite. They said, ‘Yes we are.’ And I was like, ‘This is Rochester, New York. This is a sanctuary city. Get out! We don’t want you here! This is my neighborhood. I don’t want you here. Go, get out,” said Tobin.

When our crews first got there, about 20 people were there. After awhile, over 50 people were there.

The program director for Western New York Farmworker serving agency Maria Garcia tried to coordinate getting the two workers on the roof into her car. She gave them paperwork earlier to sign for an attorney.

Garcia asked the agents if they had a warrant. After they said no, they agreed to leave, but someone in the crowd slashed their tires, and the crowd blocked their car.

Several advocacy leaders who have spoken to our crew say they were trying to keep the crowd focused on the workers, not the agents. People said they were going to stay until the workers were able to safely leave.

In a statement, the Western New York Farmworker Serving Agency said they responded to “provide interim legal education and to help ensure that the rights of impacted individuals were respected.”

“The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies was on-site today alongside members of various organizations and community groups during today’s incident involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Westminster Road. Our organization, which serves immigrants, migrants, and farmworkers across the region, responded to provide interim legal education and to help ensure that the rights of impacted individuals were respected.

Today, our staff stood alongside community members to ensure that due process was upheld and that constitutional and legal protections were respected. In this difficult and distressing moment, they remained present to share vital information, and connect impacted individuals with their families and critical resources.

As an agency, our focus is on the well-being and safety of our clients. We remain committed to carrying out our work in a lawful, transparent manner that prioritizes the rights, safety, and dignity of those we serve.

‘The Coalition is committed to standing alongside farmworkers, immigrants, and migrants to ensure dignity, fairness, and access to justice,’ said Irene Sanchez, Executive Director. ‘In moments like this, our role is to make sure people know their rights and to safeguard their due process under the law.’

The Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies reaffirms its commitment to the immigrant, migrant, and farmworker community and will continue to respond to emergent situations where constitutional protections and human dignity are at risk.”

Our crew saw people chanting and holding signs at the scene.

Senator Jeremy Cooney says in a statement that he stands with the protestors.

“Rochester, NY, is not Washington, DC! I am proud of the way our local community came together today to protect our neighbors and protest the presence of Customs and Border Patrol agents on Westminster Road. We showed up to make it clear that Rochester will not stand by idly as the federal government commences its abhorrent immigration witch hunt in our communities.”

Congresswoman Claudia Tenney posted on X, saying:

Monroe County Republican Committee Chair Patrick Reilly released a statement, condemning what he calls officials cheering on vandalism and bullying law enforcement:

“The behavior of the mob that bullied the ICE agents in Rochester today, who were just doing their job to uphold the rule of law, is completely disgusting. The fact that elected Democrat Party officials came out to cheer on the vandalism and the bullying of our law enforcement officers shows you everything that is wrong with New York State one-party rule.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions.
Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?” he said in a statement.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump’s administration at the high court.

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court’s 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration’s harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. “The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,” he wrote in a concurrence.

Dissent Says Constitutional Freedoms Threatened

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part of Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California, with a hearing set for Sept. 24. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.

More Than 5,000 Arrests Made

The Department of Homeland Security said last week that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”

The agency promised in an online post to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles” after the high court’s decision.

The region has been top priority for the Trump administration, and its hard-line immigration strategy has spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines.

The number of raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store as the administration carries out the president’s goal of mass deportations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and border czar Tom Homan both separately applauded the ruling. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” Bondi wrote in a social media post.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

‘I Was Born Here In The States’

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops that do not align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Supreme Court decision will fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents and pressed against a metal fence with his arm twisted behind his back as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

A terrified Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

Democratic leaders in California condemned the decision. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she has directed city departments to follow rules barring the use of municipal resources on federal immigration enforcement. “This isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles. This is an attack on every person in this city, and in every city in this country,” Bass told reporters.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” he said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses.”

Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant.

“I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?” he said in a statement. “That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

The Trump administration has been using four criteria to see who ICE agents can stop for immigration inquiries. They include apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent.

A Sept. 8 Supreme Court decision gives permission to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to continue sweeps in the Los Angeles area that critics and federal judges said amounted to racial profiling.

The limited-scope decision came down in an unsigned, emergency action that did not disclose which justices voted to side with President Donald Trump’s administration and offered no reasoning. But it nonetheless temporarily overturned decisions from the lower courts that blocked ICE from making stops based only on race, language, location and occupation.

All that is known about the justices’ views is that conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh largely agreed with the decision, and three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Kentanji Brown Jackson — disagreed.

Here’s what to know about the decision.

Latino US citizens said ICE ambushed them in the streets

The case, Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, started when a group of Latino residents from California and related workers’ organizations sued the government, saying they were being subject to illegal stops as part of an enforcement blitz that started June 5 in the Los Angeles area.

In one case, a U.S. citizen born and raised in east LA said he was standing on a sidewalk when agents ran toward him with handguns and military-style rifles and repeatedly asked if he was an American. Despite saying he was, they pressed him to say what hospital he was born in, the lawsuit says, but he did not know.

The agents pushed him against a metal fence, put his hands behind his back and twisted his arm, according to the lawsuit. The man eventually produced his Real ID, a type of special drivers license that requires someone to show proof of legal residence. According to the lawsuit, agents took his Real ID and his phone, returning his phone minutes later but never returning his ID.

The Trump administration has a four-part test for immigration stops

The Trump administration has been using four criteria to see who ICE agents can stop for immigration inquiries, according to court documents. They are: (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location such as a carwash or day laborer pickup site; and (4) the type of work the person does.

The people who sued the administration argued that it was illegal for the administration to solely use these criteria. The Trump administration wrote in a court filing that the people suing and the courts themselves acknowledge that “ICE at least sometimes relies on additional factors.”

Two federal courts sided with the people who were stopped

A trial court in California called ICE's practices an officially sanctioned “pattern of conduct” and said that even though there was no evidence of an “official policy” for these four criteria, immigration agents were routinely using them to make stops. The court barred the administration from relying solely on the criteria to make stops in the Los Angeles area and required ICE to use a higher legal standard called ""reasonable suspicion"" to conduct stops.

The Trump administration appealed, and an appeals court agreed with the lower court. But the Trump administration then appealed to the Supreme Court for an emergency ruling, essentially saying law enforcement were being prohibited from doing their jobs.

The Supreme Court’s limited decision, which came Sept. 8, lets ICE return to using the four criteria in the Los Angeles area, at least during the current stage in the legal process.

In a blistering dissent, Sotomayor, a liberal justice, called the decision a ""grave misuse"" of the court's emergency power. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low-wage job,"" she wrote.

Legal technicalities could’ve played a role

The Trump administration argued that the people who sued them didn’t have the right to do so, an issue that can get a case thrown out. The administration wrote that the people’s allegations were “entirely speculative” and that they offered nothing to prove their premise that they could be stopped again by ICE.

The justices who sided with the Trump administration in the one-paragraph decision did not address this issue, so Americans don’t know if the justices sided with the administration based solely on this technicality. However, in his own opinion that only represented his view, Kavanaugh agreed with the Trump administration.

“Plaintiffs have no good basis to believe that law enforcement will stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors — and certainly no good basis for believing that any stop of the plaintiffs is imminent,” Kavanaugh wrote.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86074098007-20250909-t-214742-z-796904463-rc-2-hogahzjq-9-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=4555,2562,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-10 16:56:44.242409

The first is that CFC litigation itself will raise many questions—questions the Court has given little sign it appreciates.
Accordingly, it will not help in suits like the foreign aid litigation.
Zachary S. Price is a Professor at the University of California College of Law, San Francisco (formerly UC Hastings).","The Trump administration’s long-running effort to cancel certain foreign aid is back on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. In Trump v. Global Health Council, the government is seeking to stay an injunction that requires it to obligate some $10.5 billion in aid money before the money expires at the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Although it presents many other issues, the case’s posture—challenging a refusal to obligate funds that expire in twenty-one days (and counting)—highlights a potential mootness question looming over current appropriations litigation, as well as some virtues and vices of the Court’s past emergency rulings.

Consider first the Court’s ruling two weeks ago in National Institutions of Health v. American Public Health Association. In that case, in a split ruling joined in full only by Justice Barrett, the Court held that challenges to the termination of certain medical research grants belong in the Court of Federal Claims rather federal district courts. At the same time, in the other half of its split decision, the Court allowed a challenge to the agency’s overall grant-making guidance to proceed in federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act.

This outcome depended on the interaction of two statutes. On the one hand, the APA allows suits challenging final agency action, but it only permits remedies other than money damages, and it does not apply if another statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief” in question. On the other hand, a nineteenth-century statute called the Tucker Act gives the CFC jurisdiction to award damages based on breaches of an “express or implied contract with the United States” or violations of statutes or constitutional provisions that mandate payment.

In yet another emergency-docket ruling back in April, the Court suggested that some spending claims belong in the CFC. In that case, Department of Education v. California, the Court stayed an order that “enjoin[ed] the Government from terminating various education-related grants” and “also require[d] the Government to pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they accrue.” The Court held, with scant analysis, that claims for such relief “likely” belonged in the Court of Federal Claims.

In NIH v. APHA, the Court doubled down on that suggestion. In a concurrence, two justices even scolded the district court for “defy[ing]” the Supreme Court by failing to “follow [the Court’s] direction” in DOE v. California that claims seeking payment of grant obligations “do not belong in district court.”

Whether or not the Court’s ruling was sound, splitting apart different aspects of the spending challenges will complicate litigating them, and Justice Jackson wrote a fiery dissent in NIH accusing the majority of playing a form of “Calvinball” in which “this Administration always wins.”

There is, however, one potential silver lining for the challengers: For at least some claims, the DOE and NIH rulings could actually help guarantee eventual resolution of key issues. That is so because the government might well argue in a few weeks that the end of the fiscal year has rendered district court litigation moot with respect to any expired funding.

This argument should not necessarily succeed. Lower courts including the D.C. Circuit have long held that, if challengers sue while funds remain available, the court may preserve the status quo with a preliminary injunction extending unobligated budget authority past the end of the fiscal year. A statute, moreover, seems to validate this authority by providing that “[a] provision of law requiring that the balance of an appropriation or fund be returned to the general fund of the Treasury at the end of a definite period does not affect the status of lawsuits or rights of action involving the right to an amount payable from the balance.” Alternatively, challengers might argue that they have a live claim for declaratory relief or some other remedy even if they can no longer get paid. Given the administration’s zeal for asserting executive authority over spending, perhaps spending irregularities can fit within the mootness exception for wrongs “capable of repetition yet evading review.”

The Supreme Court, however, has not squarely addressed this issue, let alone explained how any equitable power to extend budget authority should apply in the current cases. This issue is just one of many now-urgent questions that Matt Lawrence, Eloise Passachoff, and I identified as unsettled in our essay on “Appropriations Presidentialism” (though I should say that I am writing here only for myself and not necessarily for my coauthors).

That brings us to a potential benefit of NIH’s claim-splitting: Whatever the correct answer to the mootness question in other settings, CFC litigation should sidestep it. That is because damages awards from the CFC do not get paid from time-limited appropriations, but instead from a permanent, indefinite appropriation called the Judgment Fund. Accordingly, cases seeking such relief should not become moot when the fiscal year ends; the court can still order payment. Indeed, the whole point of this arrangement is to prevent the government from stiffing people, and a damages remedy here could be quite potent: if nothing else, it would undermine the administration’s claims to have achieved significant cost savings.

To that extent, far from thwarting impoundment litigation, NIH v. APHA may have helped insulate some of it from certain objections. Nevertheless, there are at least two problems.

The first is that CFC litigation itself will raise many questions—questions the Court has given little sign it appreciates. For example, it is not obvious that all grant terminations amount to breach of contract; some might but others might not. In addition, past decisions on Tucker Act jurisdiction are notoriously murky, as evidenced by the disagreements about them in the concurrences and dissents in the Court’s own recent rulings. If CFC litigation is to provide a vehicle for resolving key questions, the Court will have to stick with its apparent view that the CFC has jurisdiction—and not pull the rug out when these issues come back up the appellate ladder.

The second problem is that even a generous understanding of CFC jurisdiction will not permit litigation in that forum of all the current disputes. CFC jurisdiction, again, requires some contractual, statutory, or constitutional entitlement to payment. Accordingly, it will not help in suits like the foreign aid litigation. There, the claim is not that the agency has failed to make required payments, but instead that it has refused to award grants at all.

In such cases, the other side of Justice Barrett’s holding in NIH should help: agency non-spending (assuming it constitutes final agency action) should be reviewable under the APA for the same reasons as the grant-making guidance in NIH. But that point returns us to the mootness question we started with: Once the fiscal year ends, what relief will courts still be able to order?

Though it may not be a focus of the briefing at this stage, this problem is likely to be particularly acute in the foreign aid case. In that case, the administration has not only unlawfully deferred spending over the course of the fiscal year. It has also now claimed that it may exploit those delays to cancel some spending outright.

This theory depends on a peculiar reading of the Impoundment Control Act, a statute generally designed to limit unilateral executive spending cancellations. Although the ICA does not allow the President to cancel spending on his own, it does allow him to propose that Congress do so, and if the President makes such a “rescission” proposal, the statute allows him to delay the spending in question for a forty-five day period. After that period, the statutes makes plain that the administration must release the funds for obligation “unless” Congress has enacted rescission legislation.

Taking advantage of these mechanisms, the administration has proposed rescinding some $4 billion of the foreign aid money at issue in GHC, yet it deliberately did so less than forty-five days before the fiscal year’s end. In a maneuver called a “pocket rescission” (by analogy to the “pocket veto”), the administration believes it can still run out the forty-five day clock on this money and thus allow the funds to expire on their own due to the fiscal year’s end.

This reading of the ICA is perverse. It ignores the statutory language requiring obligation of funds unless Congress rescinds them (something Congress cannot do once funds have expired), and it turns on its head the statute’s evident purpose of constraining non-spending. Yet the administration seems committed to acting on it, and even if it has a change of heart, the administration would likely have difficulty prudently obligating $4 billion in foreign aid in the next three weeks, as the district court’s injunction requires. As a result, litigating the validity of the pocket rescission may well require confronting the question whether courts can extend budget authority beyond its expiration.

In sum, the stay request in GHC seems likely to present, directly or indirectly, a thicket of complex and interwoven questions of judicial, executive, and congressional power, some with potentially large long-run consequences. Courts do not do their best work in such a posture, and the Court’s prior under-reasoned and over-confident rulings do not inspire confidence. These cases ultimately implicate Congress’s power of the purse, an essential legislative check on unilateral executive action, and it would be better if Congress stepped in to defend its own prerogatives. Political blowback actually caused Trump to back down twice from attempted pocket rescissions in his first administration, but this time I’m not holding my breath.

That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent more than 4 million school employees nationwide.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student’s father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn’t hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?” Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration’s decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.”

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said the Trump administration is creating fear and chaos and “our students, schools, and communities are paying the price.”

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump’s decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

It’s a dangerous mistake to think Trump’s immigration purge is just about Latinos.
Although this particular case was filed on behalf of Latino defendants, there is nothing in it that limits its scope to Latinos.
Detentions of people from Guatemala and Honduras add almost 14,000 Latinos to that number.
Certainly, by any measure, Latinos are bearing the brunt of immigration enforcement.","What makes someone suspicious enough to be grabbed by masked federal authorities?

Is it a Mexican family eating dinner at a table near a taco truck?

Afghan women in hijabs working at a Middle Eastern market?

South Asian girls in colorful lehengas, speaking Hindi at an Indian wedding?

According to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing a concurrence in the Supreme Court’s emergency ruling allowing roving immigration raids in Los Angeles, any of these could be fair game, using law and “common sense.”

Brown people, speaking brown languages, hanging out with other brown people, and doing brown people things like working low-wage jobs now meets the legal standard of “reasonable suspicion” required for immigration stops.

Living while brown has become the new driving while Black.

Of course, this particular high court ruling — and our general angst — has centered on Latino immigrants. That’s fair, and understandable. In California, about half of our immigrants are from Mexico, and thousands more from other Latin and South American countries.

But increasingly, especially for newer immigrants, more folks are coming from Africa and Asian countries such as China and India — some of which, you may recall, Donald Trump called “shithole countries” way back in 2018, while questioning why America doesn’t take more immigrants from white places such as Norway.

It’s a dangerous mistake to think Trump’s immigration purge is just about Latinos. He’s made that clear himself. We have reached the point in our burgeoning white nationalism when our high court has deemed brown synonymous with illegal, regardless of what country that pigment originated in. False distinctions about who is being targeted create divisions at a time when solidarity is our greatest power.

“It’s really about racial subordination, and this is really about promoting white supremacy in this nation,” George Galvis, executive director of Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice, told me. He’s part Native American and part Latino, and 100% against policies like this one that target people by skin color.

Mexico, India, China, Iran. People from these places may not always see what they have in common, but let me help you out.

Racists see two colors: white and not white. Although this particular case was filed on behalf of Latino defendants, there is nothing in it that limits its scope to Latinos.

“It’s not targeting, you know, Eastern Europeans. It’s not targeting people who are Caucasian,” said Amr Shabaik, legal director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in L.A., a nonprofit civil rights organization advocating for American Muslims. “This is going to be on Black and brown communities, and that’s who’s going to feel the brunt.”

For Black Americans, this argument is as old as dirt. Our criminal justice system, our society, has a long and documented history of viewing Black Americans with suspicion — considering it “common sense” to think they’re up to something nefarious for actions like getting behind the wheel of a car. But, for the most part, our courts have frowned upon such obvious racism — though not always.

That anti-Black discrimination can be seen today in Trump’s deployment of the National Guard into urban centers in what Trump has described as a “war” on crime, a callback to the war on drugs of the 1990s that targeted Black Americans with devastating consequences.

This ruling on immigration enforcement goes hand-in-hand with that military deployment, two prongs in a strategy to wear away our outrage and shock at the dismantling of civil rights.

As Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in her dissent, the 4th Amendment is supposed to protect us all from “arbitrary interference” by law enforcement.

“After today,” she wrote, “that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little.”

That makes this ruling “unconscionably irreconcilable” with the Constitution, she wrote.

ICE has detained about 67,000 people across the country since last October, according to government data. Of those, almost 18,000 are from Mexico. Detentions of people from Guatemala and Honduras add almost 14,000 Latinos to that number. Places including Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela add thousands more. Certainly, by any measure, Latinos are bearing the brunt of immigration enforcement.

Other parts of the brown world are not immune, however. More than 2,800 people from India have been detained, as have more than 1,400 Chinese people. Thousands of people from across Africa, including more than 800 Egyptians, have been locked up, too.

So we are not just talking about Latino people at car washes or Home Depots. We are talking about Artesia’s Little India; Mid-City’s Little Ethiopia; the Sri Lankan community in West Covina.

We are talking about Sacramento’s Stockton Boulevard, where Vietnamese men congregate in the cafes every afternoon.

We are talking about the farms, schools and towns of the Central Valley and the Central Coast, where Latino and Asian immigrants grow our food.

We are talking about cities such as Fremont in the Bay Area, where 50% of the population is Asian, from places including India, China and the Philippines.

We are talking about California, where immigrants make up 27% of the state’s population, more than double the national average. And yes, many of them lack documents, or live in families of mixed status.

A recent UC Merced study found that there are about 2.2 million undocumented immigrants in California. Of those, about two-thirds have been here more than a decade, and half have been here for more than 20 years.

“This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws — it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses,” Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media. “Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family — and every person is now a target.”

Remember a few short months ago when our dear leader swore they were only going after criminals? How quickly did that morph into criminals being anyone who had crossed the border illegally?

And now, it has openly become anyone who is brown — and we are not even shocked. We are happily debating what the rules of these broad sweeps will be, having given up entirely on the fact that broad sweeps are horrific.

Do you think it will stop with immigration, or even crime? What about LGBTQ+ people? Or protesters? Who becomes the next threat?

Immigration sweeps are not a Latino problem, a Latino fear. We have opened the door to target people who “common sense” tells us are un-American.

The only way to close that door is with our collective strength, undivided by the kind of “common sense” discrimination that men like Kavanaugh embrace.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07ece73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4241x2227+0+405/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F54%2F3af29ffc44eb80dbf5385f2cc2b8%2F1518827-me-anti-ice-rally-home-depot-ajs-02.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:57:53.699797

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Dan Goldman led 23 House Democrats in introducing an amendment to the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would prohibit any federal funds from being used to deploy the National Guard for purposes of immigration enforcement. Goldman’s amendment comes as the Trump administration has stationed Guard units at ICE facilities across the country, including in Washington, D.C. and California, and has threatened to send troops into cities like New York, Chicago, and New Orleans to bolster his anti-immigrant crackdown.

“The use of armed soldiers, often with obscured identities, to patrol American streets and assist in immigration raids is a direct assault on the rule of law and a terrifying step toward turning our military into Trump’s personal police force,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “Congress cannot allow the National Guard to become a weapon for the president to exact vengeance on his opponents and terrorize our communities. My amendment makes clear that our troops cannot be misused for these political stunts, and I urge my colleagues from the ‘party of small government’ to join this commonsense effort.”

In July, the Trump administration authorized the deployment of the National Guard to provide ICE agents with direct protection and security for operations and personnel during immigration enforcement actions, particularly in response to concerns about violence and disorder at protest sites, as well as administrative, clerical, case management, and transportation assistance. The deployments come as the Trump administration has used masked, plainclothes ICE agents to arrest law-abiding immigrants outside immigration courthouses and detain them in inhumane conditions without any oversight from other branches of government.

Congressman Goldman has led House Democrats’ opposition to the Trump administration’s lawless immigration crackdown.

In July, Congressman Goldman and 11 other Members of Congress filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration last month over its continued refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including the 26 Federal Plaza, which is also located in the Congressman’s district.

In August, Congressman Goldman and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led over 50 of their colleagues in demanding an immediate investigation into alarming reports that U.S. citizens are being wrongfully detained and deported by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. In a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal oversight offices, the lawmakers raised urgent concerns about a growing pattern of civil rights violations against U.S. citizens during immigration sweeps.

This summer, Goldman and Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Adriano Espaillat introduced the ‘No Secret Police Act,’ which would require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals and to ban them from using home-made, non-tactical masks.

Last Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from using emergency powers under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to quickly remove members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua from the United States. The ruling marks the latest development in a high-profile legal battle between the administration and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over use of the AEA to remove illegal aliens.

Background

On March 14, President Trump signed a proclamation entitled “Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.” Through the proclamation, the President invoked the AEA to quickly remove members of the newly designated foreign terrorist organization Tren de Aragua. The proclamation held that Tren de Aragua is conducting “irregular warfare against the territory of the United States,” both directly and at the direction of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. It further declared that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of Tren de Aragua in the United States (and not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents) are now subject to the AEA and thus, “liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

The proclamation was then promptly blocked by D.C District Judge James Boasberg in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU. In a brief opinion on April 7, the Supreme Court overturned the district court’s order and held that challenges under the AEA must be brought in the district where an alien is being detained (known as habeas relief).

Following the Supreme Court’s order, the controversy continued in another lawsuit filed on April 16 in the Northern District of Texas, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals. Again, supported by the ACLU, the suit challenged the detention of the two aliens where they were being detained – per the Supreme Court’s ruling – and sought a temporary restraining order blocking removals of any aliens held within the Texas district. District Court Judge James Hendrix denied that order on April 17, deeming it unnecessary as the federal government had agreed to not remove the two aliens while the case was pending. Judge Hendrix’s order left open the option to certify a class of detainees in the district, who, if certified, could then seek an order blocking their removal.

Immediately after the temporary restraining order was blocked, the ACLU filed appeals to both the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent removal of any other individuals in the proposed class. While the Fifth Circuit denied the motion as “premature” in order to give the district court time to act, the Supreme Court entered an unusual early-morning order on April 19 instructing the federal government “not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.” On May 16, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit.

Ruling

Last week, in a 2-1 ruling, the Fifth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction blocking removals under the AEA. According to the court, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate that Tren de Aragua’s activities constituted an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” as required under the AEA. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit held:

A country’s encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States. There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Andrew Oldham asserted that the majority in the case was undermining precedent and understating the threat posed by Tren de Aragua. First, he argued that the majority is “second-guessing” the President, pointing out that courts have never blocked a president’s invocation of the AEA and that historically the Supreme Court has treated a president’s declaration of invasions or incursions as conclusive. Oldham further warned that the threat posed by Tren de Aragua is “hard to overstate,” and cited reports of the gang’s deep infiltration into Venezuelan institutions and its exploitation of the border crisis over the past four years. Judge Oldham wrote in conclusion:

The majority’s approach to this case is not only unprecedented—it is contrary to more than 200 years of precedent. It reflects a view of the Judicial power that is not only muscular—it is herculean. And it reflects a view of the Executive power that is not only diminutive—it is made subservient to the foreign-policy and public-safety hunches of every federal district judge in the country.

Conclusion

Following the decision, the Trump administration pushed back. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson echoed Judge Oldham’s claim that the majority was second-guessing the President: “The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President. We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case.” The ACLU’s Lee Gelernt meanwhile praised the ruling. “This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

A new report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) has reached a startling conclusion: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have forcibly disappeared people in Washington state in at least 16 instances, including 14 individuals and two families, since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.

The center says the two federal agencies in charge of immigration enforcement have crossed a threshold into grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law, engaging in at least two types of international crimes: enforced disappearances and refoulement.

What is an enforced disappearance?

At an Aug. 21 press conference announcing the report, UWCHR director Dr. Angelina Godoy explained that an enforced disappearance consists of several aspects that go beyond a simple detention or arrest.

“To meet the criteria of forced disappearance requires three conditions,” Godoy said. “One, a person taken into custody, typically of the state under some circumstance; maybe a party acting in state-like capacity, but typically of the state, which is what we have here. Two, the state denies access to information about where they are, how they are doing. Families oftentimes don’t know if their loved one is alive or dead, let alone where they may be held at any given time. And third, as a result of that, people are placed outside the protection of the law. They’re held incommunicado in most cases, unable to obtain legal representation, unable to defend their rights legally. That means, of course, that they may then continue to experience other types of grave violations like torture and many other things.”

Godoy argued that in 16 cases the center had identified, detainees had been denied basic rights and due process such as the right to legal representation and to appeal deportations or transfers.

The UWCHR report also outlined a large but unknown number of deportation cases from Washington state in which the act of ""refoulement"" was committed, a legal term used to describe when a refugee or asylum seeker is sent back to the country where they faced political persecution. Refoulement is strictly prohibited by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocal, the latter of which the U.S. is party to. Much of the convention's text has been adopted into U.S. law under the 1980 Refugee Act.

While the concept of “non-refoulement” is established in U.S. law, enforced disappearance has not been recognized by U.S. courts. However, several provisions, such as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, mandate due process to all people detained by the state, regardless of their immigration status. The U.S. has not signed or ratified the 2006 U.N. Convention that prohibits enforced disappearances, which has been adopted by 76 countries. However, the U.S. is a party to the U.N. Convention against torture, upon which the enforced disappearance convention is based.

The allegations of grave human rights and humanitarian law violations by the U.S. are noteworthy as wealthy, historically colonizing nations of Europe, North America and the Anglosphere played an influential role in the development of international law.

This fact, as well as the lack of retroactive application to historical atrocities like the European invasion of the Americas and trans-Atlantic slave trade, has led some scholars from the Global South to accuse international legal institutions of bias. The UWCHR report could be seen as an attempt to finally apply human rights law to the Global North as well.

Families detained for weeks without access to the outside world

Among the 16 cases of enforced disappearance studied by UWCHR researchers, seven involved migrants who were expelled to El Salvador’s CECOT megaprison in violation of a federal court order and six were related to migrants who were transferred to a detention facility at Guantánamo Bay without any access to counsel or information provided to family members. Another of those cases was that of Tuan Thanh Phan, a Vietnamese American who was deported to South Sudan and later transferred to detention at a U.S. military base in Djibouti.

Phan’s case made national news headlines due to the fact he was deported to a likely unsafe third country, thousands of miles away from his home country of Vietnam. In an unsigned June 23 order, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue sending immigrants to “third countries.”

Among the most harrowing cases covered in the UWCHR report involve two families who were detained by CBP and held in confinement for weeks without access to legal counsel. A family of six asylum seekers from Africa were apprehended on April 26 and held in a single windowless cell with no bedding or bathing facilities for 24 days in Blaine, Washington, near the U.S.-Canada border. Their youngest kid was only 11 months old and a U.S. citizen, while the mother was in the second trimester of pregnancy during her detention.

A trend of migrant dehumanization

Immigration advocates who spoke at the press conference shared that the new phase of enforced disappearances by ICE and CBP is only the next step in a long process of dehumanization against migrants in the U.S.

Josefina Mora-Cheung, an organizer with the immigration justice group La Resistencia, said that immigrants in Washington state are currently experiencing greater hostility by the Trump administration.

“There’s already a fear among the heightened climate against immigrants already,” Mora-Cheung said. “And for family members to not know that their family members are being detained or deported just puts an immense amount of trauma on our immigrant communities. We know from historical attacks on many different immigrant communities that this leaves not only direct trauma, but intergenerational trauma as well.”

Although Godoy expected human rights conditions of migrants to worsen under the Trump administration, she expressed astonishment over the rapid pace of progression toward graver abuses.

“I never expected, not in my wildest dreams, that through that rigorous process of cross-checking and cross-corroborating, we would come up with 16 cases, or actually it’s 14 individuals and then two families, in just a few months who have experienced forced disappearance in ways connected to the state of Washington,” Godoy said. “That’s an atrocious number. It’s shocking. It defies understanding.”

She added though that even before Trump took office, immigrants had already faced an unacceptable level of deprivations and abuses within the immigration system that had become routine.

“The way we got here, to this place where people are being forcibly disappeared, is by collectively tolerating the daily violation of migrants’ rights in the detention process, in the deportation process — it’s happening every day,” Godoy said. “However, forced disappearances are yet another level of concern.”

Dr. Angélica Cházaro, an immigrant rights advocate and professor at the UW School of Law, said the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, commonly referred to as the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC), is notorious for its poor treatment of migrants. These conditions have led to numerous hunger strikes and protests from detainees.

“It’s both like the devil we know, the Northwest Detention Center and the terrible conditions there that hunger strikers for years have been calling attention to, and new practices of detention and disappearance that the report is pointing to.”

Critics of ICE have also said there’s an increased politicization of the agency, with some alleging that the Trump administration is targeting political dissidents such as Palestinian U.S. permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil. Here in Washington, immigrant rights advocates have accused authorities of targeting Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a farmworker union organizer, for his work opposing the H2A program. Juarez Zeferino returned to Mexico in July after what he described as nearly four months of poor treatment at the NWDC.

More recently, ICE’s Aug. 21 detention of Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, a U.S. veteran and anti-war activist, also raised concerns of political targeting. Chaudhry’s wife, Melissa Chaudhry, ran for congress in 2024 on a left-leaning, pro-Palestine and anti-war platform.

Potential for action by state and local authorities

At the UWCHR press conference, advocates claimed that Washington state and local government officials could take a more assertive approach to stymieing ICE and CBP’s attacks on migrants.

The center’s report revealed for the first time that ICE is now deporting immigrants on commercial flights from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, in addition to King County’s Boeing Field. Cházaro said the Port of Seattle, for example, could take further actions to increase transparency on ICE operations at SeaTac.

“The moment it was clear [Trump] was taking office, that was a moment for every single institution in Washington state to be taking a look at its practices to see how could we [be] or are we complicit in ICE’s practices? And that has not happened,” Cházaro said. “We see that with the Department of Licensing, with them releasing so much information to ICE actively. We see that now with the Port of Seattle, apparently not being aware that our airport in SeaTac is being used for these deportations. Those are the sorts of things that they should have proactively been looking for at the moment that they saw the [arrival of the new] Trump administration, not holding press conferences when they claim to be supportive of immigrants without actually doing the hard work that this group of researchers at UW has done on their own to figure out what those are.

“It shouldn’t take the UW Center for Human Rights spending months of their time to reveal these connections. That is the responsibility of the institutions themselves. And so that to me is part of what’s shocking.”

Cházaro also said that Washington leaders, including Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, have ignored the plight of the small subset of migrants who have been convicted of criminal offenses. She said that people who serve their sentences shouldn’t be punished a second time via deportation.

Washington’s Keep Washington Working Act, the sanctuary law that forbids cooperation between state and local authorities and federal immigration enforcement, has an explicit carve-out that lets the state Department of Corrections transfer immigrants directly to ICE custody after they finish their sentences.

According to Cházaro, Ferguson could have pardoned Phan after he completed his 25-year sentence for first-degree murder and second-degree assault, but before he was deported to South Sudan, which would have prevented immigrant judges from revoking his green card and thus allowed him to stay in the U.S.

“The case we were making was that Governor Ferguson was the one person whose decision could lead to Tuan returning to the U.S. on his green card,” Cházaro said. “And so the fact that he failed to take that action, to me, puts the responsibility on him.”",https://www.realchangenews.org/sites/default/files/p3%20UWCHR_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:57:58.934802

President Alex Sanchez said there was “no evidence” to support the claim.

Executive director Peter Bakken said his group heard over the weekend that federal agents had been looking for a place to stage a law enforcement operation in the county, planning for it to take place Sept. 11.

“This was sometime last week,” Bakken said. “I don’t know what they were planning.”

Mountain Dreamers removed its post and shared another Sept. 8 that stated the Dillon Ranger District offices in Silverthorne “will not be utilized by Federal Migration Agents,” but agents are likely to use another location.

“An organization was spreading a rumor that we already knew about,” Sanchez said. “We chose … not to spread it because we could not verify it independently.”

Sanchez added local authorities did not provide any evidence to support the rumor. He said people talking about it were acting “in good faith,” but “good intentions don’t always turn into good impact.”

“We need to make sure that nonprofits, government officials and elected officials are acting in a responsible manner,” Sanchez said. “We cannot traumatize people more than they already are.”

Voces Unidas’ post stated most local leaders do not know about ICE operations in advance, and although there has been a “surge in federal activity in Colorado” in recent weeks, the organization found no “credible intelligence” that an operation would occur in the county Sept. 11.

Bakken and Sanchez both emphasized the importance for immigrants of being prepared for interactions with immigration agents, regardless of speculation about when operations could occur.

“We need to be able to be resilient for four years, or three-plus more years,” Sanchez said. “We need to figure out how to best work as communities.”

Mountain Dreamers and Voces Unidas both have resources on their websites to help immigrants prepare. Sanchez said Voces Unidas posts daily about any confirmed immigration enforcement activity in Summit and surrounding counties.

Voces Unidas has a hotline for people to report ICE activity or request help for affected families, which is 970-340-8586. It also emphasizes the importance of immigrants knowing their rights.

Sanchez said most of the cases Voces Unidas has dealt with since January where people are detained by ICE have involved people not knowing their rights and offering information.

“The stop turned into a detention turned into a formal arrest, and eventually the proceedings happened,” Sanchez said. “Knowing your rights has been well documented to work.”

Both Voces Unidas and Mountain Dreamers have information about immigrant rights on their websites. For a full list of information on legal rights, visit MountainDreamers.org/knowyourrightsimmigration .

Sanchez also mentioned the importance of “family planning,” encouraging immigrants to think about what they will do if their family members are separated. He said contacting and establishing a relationship with an immigration lawyer before any issues arise can be helpful.

“Discuss about what happens with minors and who can take care of kids in the worst-case scenario,” Sanchez said. “As harsh and as traumatizing this process is, this process is not new to our communities.”

Voces Unidas has resources for making a family plan on its website.

Bakken said Mountain Dreamers has seen an “outpouring of support” for the immigrant community since the weekend.

“We’ve had lots of folks offering to volunteer with us and help out in any way they can,” Bakken said. “We’re just gonna be prepared for whatever happens, and hopefully nothing will.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2025/08/13093907/shutterstock_1043196382-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 17:57:21.919058

Washington state law gives the Attorney General broad authority to sue on behalf of the people of Washington.

As the state’s largest law firm, the Attorney General’s Office provides legal representation to every state agency, board, and commission in Washington.","SEATTLE – At an average of more than one lawsuit a week, Washington state has sued the Trump administration 37 times since January.

The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) filed these lawsuits to fight for the civil rights and privacy of Washingtonians, and to protect $14 billion in federal funding that supports vital public services for people across the state. Summaries of these lawsuits, and links to the case dockets are now available.

“This president refuses to follow the Constitution and abide by the rule of law. Fortunately, states like Washington are fighting to ensure our foundational principles and rights are protected,” Brown said. “Whether it’s attacks on workers, students, public safety, the environment, immigrants, or other core pieces of our communities, this office has an excellent team passionate about safeguarding Washingtonians’ rights. Together, we’re working every day to defend Washington law and help get the state through these times.”

Washington’s legal team has secured notable wins, including:

A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling blocking President Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship, which would have harmed thousands of Washington babies each year, and affirming the nationwide scope of the injunction

Full restoration of about $150 million in funding for Washington schools and educational programs that the Trump administration had frozen

An order blocking the president’s illegal actions to “end” gender affirming care to young people through withholding funding to medical institutions and providers who provide such care

Protecting more than $180 million in funding for infrastructure projects that guard against natural disasters, such as levees and earthquake retrofitting

Preserving more than $21 million in funding for AmeriCorps service and volunteer programs in Washington

Restoring more than $71 million in funding for the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure in Washington

The AGO has experienced some setbacks, including in orders issued by the U.S. Supreme Court through the emergency shadow docket, which refers to cases the court considers on an emergency basis without full briefing and oral argument. Decisions made this way are not the final word, and litigation on the core issues of each case continues. Some cases include:

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the federal government, and against Washington and 15 other states, effectively allowing the National Institutes of Health to terminate $783 million in grants that the administration deemed were related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, gender identity, and other topics. We are fighting to ensure these terminated grants are restored to researchers and that future terminations cannot be made based on illegal federal policies.

The high court granted an order that allows the Department of Education to take steps to dismantle itself while the underlying case proceeds. The AGO hopes to brief and argue the issue fully before the court, so that this critical federal agency can be preserved.

For Washington, there are three basic criteria that must be met when filing a federal lawsuit against the executive branch:

Whether the administration’s actions are illegal or unconstitutional,

Whether the actions are harming Washingtonians or entities in the state, and

Whether a lawsuit is necessary to protect Washington’s interests.

Washington state law gives the Attorney General broad authority to sue on behalf of the people of Washington. That means when Washingtonians’ rights are under attack, whether that’s by a company defrauding consumers or by the president of the United States curtailing the civil rights of residents, the office can file a lawsuit and seek justice on their behalf. The Attorney General also serves as chief legal officer for most of state government, and many of the federal lawsuits have been filed on behalf of state agencies harmed by the federal administration’s actions. At this point in time during the first Trump administration, Washington state had filed 13 lawsuits.

While the challenges created by the current president are significant, the work of the AGO encompasses much more than federal litigation. Some of the agency’s many responsibilities include protecting consumers and workers, enforcing antitrust laws against anti-competitive business practices, enforcing state civil rights laws, prosecuting sexually violent predators, protecting the rights of veterans, and safeguarding the environment.

She travelled to the Canada-U.S. border in Niagara Falls, Ont., Sunday to help argue the family's case.
Fearing arrest and deportation to Haiti by ICE, Paulna, her family and her sister, decided to come to Canada where Maxen already lived.
Border agents had taken issue with Paulna's paperwork due to a middle name on her documents that her siblings didn't have.
Maxen was told Paulna and her family were already on their way to ICE detention in Texas.","A Haitian family has been allowed in Canada, following nearly two months in an American immigration detention centre after being turned away by Canadian border agents.

The family had tried to reunite with a brother in Canada in mid-July but were denied entry by Canadian border agents who told them they believed their documents were fraudulent.

The two adults and three children, ages two, eight and 12, were handed over to United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and taken to a detention centre for families in Texas, where they were held until this weekend.

Heather Neufeld, the family's lawyer, says the case is part of a growing trend of Canadian border agents making erroneous decisions that are forcing asylum claimants into the punitive U.S. immigration detention system.

""A wrong decision means someone is sent back to the U.S., to detention in terrible conditions and very likely deportation,"" said Neufeld, who is based in Ottawa. She travelled to the Canada-U.S. border in Niagara Falls, Ont., Sunday to help argue the family's case.

""It's a completely different environment now.""

Neufeld said the fact that the family was let into the country after CBSA redetermined their case with only a few additions to their documents shows the agency appears to be making more wrong decisions in its push to remove an extra 4,000 people from the country by 2027.

CBC News reported the family's story last week, while they were still detained in Texas.

The mother, Paulna, had been trying to reunite with her brother, Maxen, who has been in Canada for 12 years and is now a citizen.

They went to the U.S. last summer under a humanitarian program for people from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti. That program was ended by U.S. President Donald Trump in June, which left more than 500,000 people in the country at risk of deportation.

Fearing arrest and deportation to Haiti by ICE, Paulna, her family and her sister, decided to come to Canada where Maxen already lived. Having a relative here meant they could claim asylum.

CBC News is not publishing surnames of Maxen and his family members because they fear it could jeopardize their immigration case or result in reprisals in Haiti if they are deported.

By the time Maxen arrived to pick up his relatives, CBSA had only allowed the elder sister, who did not want to be identified, to enter Canada and claim asylum. Border agents had taken issue with Paulna's paperwork due to a middle name on her documents that her siblings didn't have.

Maxen was told Paulna and her family were already on their way to ICE detention in Texas.

Over the following months, Maxen struggled to get a picture of the family's conditions in detention.

The family has begun to share details of what happened to them there. He says Edy, Paulna's husband, was hit by ICE guards at the centre and that the air conditioning was so powerful that they were always cold.

The children appeared pale and slightly dishevelled when he finally saw them Sunday night. The next day, he took them to the hairdresser.

""I love them so much,"" he said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7630068.1757523772!/cantoImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/maxen-portraits.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-10 15:58:04.137108

The National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers joined a federal lawsuit Tuesday after the Trump administration took away the directive for immigration officials to stay away from school grounds.

Although no Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) officials are known to have entered a school for enforcement, the lawsuit alleges people have been arrested while dropping off students and other parents have pulled students from school or certain activities due to fear of deportation.

The teacher unions point to studies showing enrollment drops or increases in absences after ICE activity has been reported in certain areas.

“Every student who comes into their public school — no matter what they look like or the language they speak — belongs in a safe and welcoming public school so they can learn and grow,” said Becky Pringle, NEA President.

“By targeting schools, Donald Trump’s ICE is creating fear and chaos, and our students, their families and communities are paying the price for these traumatic and extreme immigration actions. We have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe. We will continue to show up for our students and their families, and we will stand up at our schools and communities when they are under attack,” she added.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.”","A rightwing influencer accompanied officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Chicago on Sunday as the agency ramps up arrests in the city. Ice agents arrested four people on the city’s south-west side.

Ben Bergquam, the rightwing internet personality, was with agents, filming and making content as well as getting into altercations with local residents along the way, according to a video the Guardian viewed on X. In the video, he appears to be in the car with Ice agents and nearby as they arrest people; later on he yells at a group of Chicagoans who are gathered to prevent Ice operations that they are “the enemy within”.

Bergquam often travels to migrant shelters and protests, and has even filmed an Ice raid in Chicago previously to prove wrongdoing by those opposed to Donald Trump and his agenda. In a 2024 video he falsely claimed that Hurricane Helene victims wouldn’t be helped out financially because the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), spent all its money housing migrants in Chicago.

Usually based in Fresno, California, Bergquam has been traveling to the Illinois city since at least 2019, according to Block Club Chicago, when he falsely accused a local pastor of being part of a transnational group that guided migrant caravans from Central and South America. He is a part of the same rightwing network, Real America’s Voice News, that hosts shows by Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk and other far-right figures.

“Ice has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city, which protects them over law-abiding citizens,” the immigration agency told the Guardian, but did not respond to questions about whether it had authorized Bergquam to attend Ice enforcement activities. “We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge Ice resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.”

Bergquam did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The Department of Homeland Security posted on X that the agency’s operations on Sunday and Monday in Chicago constituted what it called “Operation Midway Blitz”, with a focus on the predominantly Latino neighborhoods surrounding the Midway airport.

This comes just as the supreme court ruled that Ice can continue its operations in Los Angeles, which were paused because of how the agency was conducting itself and detaining people based on criteria that included “blatant racial profiling”, according to a US district judge.

Trump took aim at Chicago’s sanctuary policies and depicted it as crime-infested On Saturday, he posted to Truth Social: “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” but he walked back that statement on Sunday. His stated plan is to deploy the national guard to the city to combat crime, as he has done in Los Angeles and Washington DC. However, the city’s crime rate over the summer was the lowest in 60 years, according to WBEZ.

Bergquam visited Chicago in January and accompanied the “border czar”, Tom Homan, on Ice raids, and again in April when he stood outside a city shelter that served newly arrived migrants and unhoused Chicagoans, and pointed at women standing outside, calling them “illegals”.

Members of the DHS and White House officials have put together their own sizzle reels to show off Ice operations and used the opportunities to promote their mass deportation plans, with the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, fully glammed up for videos during Ice raids. The DHS, the White House and Noem have all posted on social media in a bizarre fashion about the raids, with one August post from the DHS featuring a video of Ice agents raiding a car wash set to the 1976 single Car Wash by Rose Royce.

They have even had Dr Phil, the celebrity physician whose real name is Phil McGraw, attend, calling into question what purpose these raids serve for the agency.

Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, posted on Monday on X that he was not made aware of the federal government’s activities in the city when they began: “The City of Chicago received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration.

Roberts acted on the administration’s emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. President Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The high court order is temporary, though it suggests the justices will reverse a lower court ruling that withholding the funding was probably illegal. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and the possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs. The administration turned to the high court after a panel of federal appellate judges declined to block Ali’s ruling.

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that an additional $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

City of Chicago

What we know:

Mayor Brandon Johnson announced last week that Chicago is expanding its ""Know Your Rights"" and ""Family Preparedness"" campaigns.

""My administration will not allow our communities to be consumed by fear and uncertainty. We will continue to provide updated information so that all of the families of Chicago are prepared,"" Johnson said in a statement.

The initiatives include printable and fillable preparedness packets, infographics and guides with trusted resources and community contacts, and weekly workshops to help families create safety and communication plans. The city also launched an upgraded immigrant and refugee rights website.

Chicago suburbs

Skokie, Bolingbrook, Evanston, and Maywood have echoed similar messages, reminding residents of their rights under Illinois law and pointing to legal aid hotlines, community resources, and village services.

Skokie officials emphasized the village’s compliance with the Illinois TRUST Act, which bars local police from enforcing federal immigration law.

""The Village of Skokie values inclusion, dignity and respect for all, and is committed to providing safe access to Village services and protecting the rights of all who live in our community,"" the village said.

SKOKIE RESOURCES

Bolingbrook leaders said their police department does not question immigration status during routine stops and does not notify ICE without a federal judicial warrant.

""The Bolingbrook Police Department is dedicated to building trust within our community and will not waste resources eroding it,"" BPD said.

Evanston warned of possible ICE presence and urged residents to use the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline (855-435-7693) to report sightings.

EVANSTON RESOURCES

""In Evanston, we welcome our immigrant and refugee neighbors and protect each other,"" the city said. ""We will do all we can to safeguard our community and keep Evanston families together.""

City leaders stressed that Evanston police officers will continue to wear clearly marked uniforms or vests to distinguish themselves from federal agents. Residents who encounter suspicious or unmarked individuals claiming to be law enforcement are urged to call 911 or file a complaint with the Evanston Police Department.

Maywood Mayor Nathaniel George Booker said the village stands ""united with Illinois and Cook County"" and stressed that ""uninvited, unwanted and unjustified"" visits from ICE are not welcome.

""Together, we will ensure that no show of force is stronger than a united community,"" Booker said.

The backstory:

The warning comes as President Donald Trump has renewed his focus on Chicago, repeatedly citing violent crime as justification for tougher federal intervention.

Over the weekend, Trump pointed to recent shootings in Chicago and doubled down on plans to target immigration enforcement. He also defended a Truth Social post featuring an AI-generated image of himself styled as a Vietnam War movie character with the caption ""Chipocalypse Now,"" a post that critics said threatened deportations and military action in the city.

When pressed, Trump said his administration’s approach was about ""cleaning up cities,"" not war. Still, he has suggested deploying the National Guard to Chicago, calling it ""a mess.""

Local leaders say such rhetoric has fueled fear among immigrant families.

On Tuesday, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights reported that ICE vehicles were seen parked outside the Cook County Courthouse.

""During this time of uncertainty and fear, it is critical to maintain a strong sense of community, as well as provide accurate information,"" the City of Evanston said, adding they will continue to share updates and ""well-sourced information from credible sources"" as it becomes available.

Operation Midway Blitz

The Department of Homeland Security launched Operation Midway Blitz on Monday, an effort to crack down on undocumented immigrants in Chicago and Illinois.

The operation was launched in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed this year in a hit-and-run car crash with a Guatemalan man who was in the country illegally.

At the start of Trump’s second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student’s father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn’t hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?” Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration‘s decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.”

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump’s decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

In a statement, Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell revealed that the DOW was “identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve” in such a capacity. The move is part of the Trump administration’s multi-pronged strategy to finally tackle the many overlapping crises plaguing our immigration system.

The policy was made possible by a new federal rule published by the DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on August 28. The new regulation liberalized the requirements to serve as temporary immigration judges (TIJs), thereby allowing “the Attorney General and Director of EOIR to select TIJs from a larger pool of well-qualified candidates.”

According to one news report, approximately 150 of the 600 military attorneys authorized to serve as temporary immigration judges may potentially start working in their new capacities as early as the first week of September. Others will undergo two weeks of training.

The justification behind supplementing sitting immigration judges with temporary ones is the sheer size of the immigration court backlog, which, as of July 2025, consisted of almost 3.5 million pending cases. This is just slightly smaller than the total population of America’s second largest city, Los Angeles. Only a decade ago in 2015, the backlog was less than 460,000 cases, growing to 1.3 million in 2020 and 3.7 million in 2024. The key factors in growing this massive backlog were high levels of illegal immigration and large-scale asylum abuse.

The number of immigration judges has also grown over the years. In 2010, there were 245 immigration judges, doubling to 466 in early 2020. In 2025, there were approximately 700. Given the backlog, the pro-mass-migration media has argued that the termination of some 100 immigration judges by the Trump administration makes little sense and works at cross-purposes with the administration’s goals of mass removals and clearing the backlog. What they fail to mention is that the Biden administration was not averse to firing immigration judges either. The difference is that the Biden administration terminated immigration judges who believed in upholding the law and discouraging asylum fraud while the Trump administration fired judges who rubberstamped practically all asylum applications, some with asylum grant rates of 96 percent – which, of course, only incentivizes more asylum-fraud-driven illegal immigration, thereby adding to the backlog.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Judge-holding-gavel-in-courtroom-104821184_4841x3633.jpg.webp?itok=9-jXx-Tw,N,,2025-09-10 12:56:52.950282

The strange reference to a “secret” shared between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.
Last week, a local judge blocked South Carolina from releasing private voter information to the Justice Department.
A federal database would be out of date a day after any voter list was turned over to federal officials.
“Ask how many people are satisfied with what the Justice Department has done on the Jeffrey Epstein files,” he said.","The decision from Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia marked only the first salvo in what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle over the president’s ability to remove a Fed official “for cause,” a term generally understood to mean professional neglect or wrongdoing.

In her ruling, Judge Cobb said Mr. Trump’s justifications for removing Ms. Cook did not meet the threshold for sufficient cause, in part because the action in question took place before her tenure as a Fed governor began. Ms. Cook signed her mortgage documents in 2021, roughly a year before she joined the Fed after being appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

“The best reading of the ‘for cause’ provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a governor’s behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,” she said. “‘For cause’ thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office.”

Lawyers at the Justice Department argued in their first hearing that the president had expansive powers to determine what constitutes cause and that the court should be “highly deferential” to that interpretation.

Judge Cobb hit back at that assertion directly in her ruling. “According to the government, the determination of cause is committed to the president’s discretion by statute, leaving no role for this court. The court disagrees,” she said.

Ms. Cook also was denied adequate due process, Judge Cobb argued, agreeing with a central part of her lawyers’ argument.

“Today’s ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference,” Ms. Cook’s attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement. “Allowing the president to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law.”

The Trump administration is likely to appeal the ruling. In a statement, Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said the president had “lawfully removed” Ms. Cook, adding: “This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed.”

The judge’s order means that Ms. Cook will be able to cast a vote when the Fed gathers for its next two-day meeting, which will begin on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to restart interest rate cuts that have been on hold since January, most likely reducing borrowing costs a quarter point.

The Fed declined to comment on the ruling. It had previously pledged to carry out any decision rendered by the court.

“Removal protection is an important measure that helps insulate the Fed from inappropriate political interference,” said Graham Steele, a longtime financial regulation lawyer and former Treasury Department official. “The court’s thorough and well-reasoned decision reaches the right conclusion.”

Mr. Trump has sought to force down borrowing costs for months, accusing Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and other officials at the central bank of harming the economy by not moving quickly enough to cut rates. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate set in a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent since January. Mr. Trump has called on the Fed to slash borrowing costs by three percentage points.

The president is seeking to gain a majority of support on the Fed’s board, which would give him not only greater sway over deliberations related to interest rates and the oversight of Wall Street but also leverage over the 12 regional Fed presidents, who vote on big policy decisions on a rotating basis, as well as the central bank’s staff.

In its ruling, the court declined to take up the issue of Mr. Trump’s motivation for firing Ms. Cook.

Now, with the release this week of new information from Mr. Epstein’s estate, including a suggestive note apparently signed by Mr. Trump, the drip-drip-drip of revelations is complicating the White House strategy of brushing off the entire controversy.

The president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Tuesday was once again confronted with questions about the so-called Epstein files, a collection of documents from the law enforcement investigation into Mr. Epstein’s abuse of girls and women.

The White House has denied for weeks that Mr. Trump sent a bawdy birthday note to Mr. Epstein in 2003, the subject of an earlier Wall Street Journal report. But on Monday, the House Oversight Committee obtained the document and released it.

Suddenly, there it was out in the open for all to see. The drawing of a naked woman. The strange reference to a “secret” shared between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein.

In response, Ms. Leavitt at first deflected. She accused Democrats of opportunistically clamoring to release the Epstein documents while Mr. Trump was president, something they did not make a major push for during the Biden presidency.

“Why are the Democrats all of a sudden caring about this? It’s because they are desperately trying to concoct a hoax to smear the president of the United States,” Ms. Leavitt said.

Then she shifted to denial.

Ms. Leavitt again denied that Mr. Trump had written the note in question. She said the White House would even support a professional handwriting analyst’s evaluation of the signature, which she said would vindicate the president.

The signature on the note closely matches the first-name-only version of the way the president signed his name in letters to New York City officials at the time.

Ms. Leavitt was then asked about another item in the documents released Monday: an oversized check that purports to be a joking payment of $22,500 from Mr. Trump to Mr. Epstein, to buy a “fully depreciated” woman.

Ms. Leavitt again denied Mr. Trump’s involvement, saying he “absolutely” had not signed the check in question.

But even as Ms. Leavitt called the situation a “hoax” and claimed Mr. Trump had no role in the documents released, she said she had never claimed they were fake.

The documents were subpoenaed from the Epstein estate. Under questioning from reporters, Ms. Leavitt said she “did not say the documents are a hoax.” Instead, she suggested that someone must have forged Mr. Trump’s signature. “The president has one of the most famous signatures in the world, and he has for many, many years,” she said.

It was clear she was following the lead of her boss.

Throughout the month of July, Mr. Trump repeatedly attempted to instruct the media and fellow Republicans to move on from the Epstein files. In a post on Truth Social, he urged the G.O.P. to “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

But the clamor for the files persisted, and the president repeatedly referred to the controversy as a “hoax,” angering Mr. Epstein’s victims.

After The Wall Street Journal reported on the Epstein birthday note, Mr. Trump filed suit accusing the paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, of defaming him.

“These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Mr. Trump has long drawn pictures and even sold them at auction.)

He repeated his denial on Tuesday night, saying that “anybody that’s covered me for a long time knows that’s not my language. It’s nonsense.”

Democrats have seized on the controversy. But more concerning for Mr. Trump, he has not been able to convince all Republicans to back off an effort to release the files.

Four Republicans, Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, have joined with Democrats to support what is called a discharge petition to force the release of the files.

Still, Republicans have mostly fought the effort, and G.O.P. leaders in Congress have largely sided with Mr. Trump’s insistence that he played no role in the bawdy birthday note to Mr. Epstein.

“I’m told that it’s fake,” Speaker Mike Johnson said of the note.

Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, said that he accepted Mr. Trump’s denial about the note.

“The president says he did not sign it, so I take the president at his word,” Mr. Comer said on Tuesday.

He added that he was not inclined to investigate the signature’s authenticity, even as Mr. Comer is leading an investigation into the legitimacy of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature on documents that were signed with an autopen.

Michael Gold contributed reporting.

Chief Justice Roberts’s order noted that the money is the subject of a proposal from the administration pending before Congress. That proposal, known as a “pocket rescission,” is a legally untested effort to claw back appropriated money by waiting so late in the fiscal year to make the request that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires. It could make the court challenge moot.

The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, before the 45-day period in which Congress is required to consider a rescission request from the White House. Republicans could bring the matter to a vote sooner, but party leaders have shown little appetite for resisting the president’s spending demands and asserting their own prerogatives.

The case before the Supreme Court has reached the justices three times. In an emergency application filed Monday, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, told the court that the judge’s order requiring it to spend $4 billion in payments by the end of the month raised “a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.”

Mr. Sauer noted the proposal before Congress. “While proposed rescissions are pending, presidents do not spend the funds, for obvious reasons: it would be self-defeating and senseless for the executive branch to obligate the very funds that it is asking Congress to rescind,” he wrote. “Yet the new injunction would force the executive branch to start obligating those funds at breakneck speed to meet the Sept. 30 deadline, even as Congress is considering the rescission proposal and before its 45 days to do so elapse.”

The application was the latest in a barrage of emergency requests by the administration seeking broad executive authority, including the power to halt federal spending appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court, with six conservative justices, has proved receptive to most of the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Still, in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case, in March, the chief justice and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, two nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s authority over spending.

The case has bounced around the court system. The latest application concerns a ruling last week from Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington that said the administration had “given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must be followed” and requiring the administration to allow the funds to flow.

A federal appeals court last month invalidated many of President Trump’s punishing global tariffs, saying the law he relied on did not authorize the administration’s program. The import taxes remain in effect while the litigation continues.

In a 7-to-4 ruling in late August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the president had unlawfully used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose steep taxes on major U.S. trading partners.

Last week, Mr. Trump’s lawyers urged the justices to review the ruling quickly by adding the case to the court’s calendar for the new term that begins in October. They issued a stark warning against allowing the appeals court ruling to stand, saying it threatens to unwind trade deals.

“That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the president has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,” according to the filing from Solicitor General D. John Sauer.

“Few cases have so clearly called out for this court’s swift resolution.”

While the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has repeatedly granted Mr. Trump’s emergency requests and cleared the way for the administration to at least temporarily put into place its policies, the tariffs case will be the first occasion for the justices to hear arguments and weigh the underlying legal merits of a key administration priority.

Five small businesses and a dozen states sued over the tariffs, saying Mr. Trump’s actions were unlawful and that the powers to tax must remain with Congress. Their position has support from a coalition of prominent conservative and libertarian lawyers, scholars and former officials.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement.

The Constitution generally gives Congress the power to tax. But a 1977 statute gives the president broad emergency powers to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to regulate imports. The president’s lawyers say that language affords him the authority to impose tariffs when he believe an emergency exists.

Mr. Trump and his economic advisers say the tariffs and subsequent negotiations with trading partners are reversing decades of trade policies that have reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity and military readiness. The levies, they argue, have spurred other countries to invest in the U.S. economy.

But the appeals court said the emergency law does not give Mr. Trump the authority to impose his sprawling tariffs program. The majority did not decide whether the statute might allow the president to impose more limited tariffs, finding Mr. Trump’s particular program so significant and enduring that it must be expressly authorized by Congress.

Mr. Trump used the emergency law last month to tax imports from about 90 countries and previously invoked it to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico.

Other presidents have invoked the emergency statute, typically to issue sanctions, but Mr. Trump is the first to try to use the emergency powers to impose broad levies of 10 to 50 percent on trading partners. The administration can turn to other statutes to impose tariffs, but they are more limited than the emergency powers he has relied on.

Separately, the Supreme Court in June refused to fast-track a second case from two toy manufacturers challenging part of the president’s tariffs program. In that case, the companies were seeking to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has scheduled argument for Sept. 30. A district court judge sided with the companies, finding that the tariffs were not authorized under the emergency statute and were “an existential threat to their businesses.”

Lawyers for the toy manufacturers renewed their request to the justices in a filing Thursday, asking the court to consider consolidating and expediting the pair of cases involving tariffs.

The New York Times obtained a draft of the report in August. The final report is largely unchanged, and does not always clearly explain how the government will implement its recommendations.

In the report, Mr. Kennedy has returned to his usual talking points: that American children are sick, stressed and screen-addicted, and that corporate interests and prescription medications are to blame. It is the clearest articulation yet of how the administration plans to carry out the aims of the MAHA movement.

Yet even with the familiar rhetoric, the report is very likely to disappoint some corners of Mr. Kennedy’s MAHA coalition.

It demonstrates both the ambitions and limits of his agenda. It stops short of calling for direct restrictions on pesticides and ultraprocessed foods, which Mr. Kennedy has called major threats. The strategy suggests collaboration — not confrontation — with the food and agriculture industries, saying that the government will back “precision agricultural techniques” to help farmers use less pesticides. After The Times reported on the draft, some members of the MAHA movement expressed frustration at what they saw as signs of Mr. Kennedy’s capitulations to these industries.

Read the MAHA strategy report.

A report from the White House outlines strategies to combat childhood chronic disease and attempts to set a MAHA agenda for the country.

Read Document 20 pages

The report points to a number of actions the Trump administration has already announced and branded victories, including establishing an infertility training center, cracking down on food dyes, relaunching the Presidential Fitness Test in public schools, studying the “root causes” of autism and working to define ultraprocessed foods and update the U.S. dietary guidelines.

Other significant parts of the strategy are at odds with actions the administration has taken. For example, the report calls for providing “whole, healthy food” through the government-funded SNAP nutrition program for low-income Americans — but Mr. Trump signed legislation this year that significantly cut SNAP funding. It also suggests prioritizing research and analysis of the health effects of poor water and air quality, but the administration has abandoned major pollution regulations.

There are also places where the report’s goals conflict with each other. For example, it says the government will “review new scientific information on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water,” but also identifies poor oral health and childhood cavities — which fluoride in drinking water helps prevent, according to decades of research — as potential causes of chronic disease. It says the C.D.C. will issue new recommendations on fluoride in water, which Mr. Kennedy has called dangerous despite the fact that most U.S. water supplies fall well within what scientists consider safe fluoride limits.

The report contains a few bold ideas, but not always a clear path to implementing them. The document suggests the government will crack down on direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs, and calls for closing the so-called “GRAS” loophole, a provision that lets companies put new chemicals or ingredients into food products as long as they are “generally recognized as safe.” It also says the government will consider developing guidelines to limit the ways companies market “unhealthy” foods to children.

In May, the commission released a report that blamed ultraprocessed foods, toxic chemicals and prescription drugs for fueling “the sickest generation in American history.” The May document cited studies that did not exist, and in some cases drew faulty conclusions from existing evidence.

Tuesday’s 20-page document charges the government with “ensuring America has the best childhood vaccine schedule” at a time when Mr. Kennedy has named vaccine critics to a key vaccine advisory panel, overseen changes that restrict Americans’ access to Covid vaccines and seeded doubt about the safety and effectiveness of many shots. The report also calls for new research into vaccine injuries, a topic Mr. Kennedy has consistently brought up as he fuels suspicion around routine immunizations.

It also says the government will create education campaigns aimed at improving fertility and will evaluate “overprescription trends” in the use of SSRIs, antipsychotics, stimulants and other mental health drugs for children.

Though the report pushes for new research initiatives and public awareness campaigns, it does not include many specific policies. It says the government will commission a slew of new studies to better understand microplastics, air quality, the cumulative toll of chemicals and even electromagnetic radiation. It also says the surgeon general will start campaigns on educating children about the effects of screen time, vaping, cannabis and alcohol. (The current nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has not yet been confirmed.)

It is not clear how the government might fund these initiatives. The Trump administration has made large cuts to scientific funding over the last few months.

Mr. Kennedy and other members of the commission, including Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, and Dr. Marty Makary, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, are speaking at an event at 2 p.m. Eastern to release the report.

Its proponents, Representatives Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, appear poised within weeks to draw enough backers to force action on the House floor, provided Democrats win special elections this month in districts where they are heavily favored.

But while their effort is expected to continue being a political headache for Republican leaders and the White House, there is still no guarantee it will receive a vote, and little chance that the House would compel the Justice Department to comply even if it passed.

Here’s how it works.

A House majority can force action, even if leaders object.

Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump administration officials had hoped they could thwart Mr. Massie and Mr. Khanna’s effort to force their measure to the floor.

But Mr. Massie, a frequent Trump antagonist, is on the brink of drawing enough support from the House to move forward. Last week, he introduced what is known as a discharge petition, a maneuver that allows lawmakers to circumvent party leaders and bring a bill to the floor if 218 lawmakers demand it.

By the time the House Oversight Committee investigating the handling of Mr. Epstein’s case released a 2003 drawing and note that appeared to contain Mr. Trump’s signature, the petition had 216 signatures. Just four are from Republican representatives: Mr. Massie and Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

Mr. Johnson has made his opposition to the discharge petition explicit, and Mr. Massie has said that the White House has been pressuring lawmakers not to sign. Several Republicans who supported Mr. Massie’s resolution have withdrawn, and the effort to win more appeared to stall.

But the two signatures that Mr. Massie needs could come later this month from newly elected Democrats, who are projected this month to win special elections in deep-blue districts to succeed lawmakers who died in office this year.

James Walkinshaw is the favorite to win an election on Tuesday in a Northern Virginia district left vacant since May by the death of Representative Gerald E. Connolly, whom he served as chief of staff. Mr. Walkinshaw has promised to sign Mr. Massie’s discharge petition if he is elected.

Two weeks later, Adelita Grijalva is expected to win a special election in a solidly Democratic district in Arizona to succeed her father, Representative Raul M. Grijalva, a 12-term congressman who died in March. She is also expected to join the rest of her party in signing Mr. Massie’s petition.

A vote would be politically toxic for the G.O.P.

Should both Democrats win and sign, Republican leaders would find themselves in a political jam as they continue to navigate competing demands from Mr. Trump.

After his administration promised shocking revelations in the case, the president has weathered a backlash for its sudden reversal and refusal to make public its investigative files. He has condemned the continued fallout as a Democratic hoax, and lashed out at his own supporters for demanding more information on the investigation into Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

If the measure were to pass, it is not clear whether the Republican-led Congress, which has deferred to Mr. Trump at every turn, would take any action if the Justice Department declined to comply with its demand for the files. That would require a separate vote to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress.

But a vote on whether to compel the release of the files would be politically painful for Republicans who have echoed the calls of constituents who have long clamored for the material. They would have to choose between backing the voters who elected them or backing Mr. Trump in his desire to keep the matter closed.

Republican leaders are still trying avoid a vote.

Even if the petition were to receive the requisite 218 signatures to force action, there is no guarantee it would proceed to the floor. House leaders have a range of procedural maneuvers they can use to thwart legislation even if it has the support of a majority of the House.

The White House is also expected to continue trying to pressure the Republicans who have signed the discharge petition to remove their names. And Republican leaders have pointed to the Oversight Committee’s investigation and recent release of files as evidence that no vote by the full House is needed to assure transparency on the Epstein case.

News of the recall came amid a debate over the Trump administration’s policy toward the country. Mr. Grenell, who serves as an envoy to Venezuela, has advocated negotiations with its authoritarian government, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio has pushed for a more hard-line approach.

But other officials said the recall of the report had little to do with competing camps in the Trump administration and was more about improperly identifying a senior official in an intelligence document.

The report focused on Mr. Grenell’s conversations and negotiations with Nicolás Maduro, the authoritarian leader of Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The report and the recall were issued several months ago, at a time when Mr. Grenell was negotiating the return of undocumented immigrants to Venezuela, according to people briefed on the report.

President Trump had appointed Mr. Grenell as an envoy to Venezuela and asked him to lead negotiations. Mr. Rubio was working on a different track on Venezuelan negotiations.

The original report was circulated throughout the intelligence community. But more recently, the White House has ordered spy agencies to limit the number of people receiving intelligence on Venezuela.

The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies routinely retract reports when new information renders old ones erroneous or if mistakes are detected. But the unclassified note retracting the Venezuela report noted that the N.S.A. work remained sound.

“The report is accurate and in accordance with all N.S.A. policy, directives and guidance; however, the D.N.I. directed N.S.A. to recall the report,” the recall notice said, referring to the director of national intelligence.

Multiple people briefed on the matter insisted the report was recalled because it did not adequately hide Mr. Grenell’s identity, describing him as the presidential envoy to Venezuela. Ms. Gabbard has asked intelligence agencies to take special care with reports that either directly identify Trump administration officials or are written in ways that could easily identify them.

During the first Trump administration, the issue of “unmasking” U.S. officials who were caught up in communications intercepts became a contentious issue. As a result, Ms. Gabbard has tried to avoid identifying Americans in intelligence reports out of concern for privacy and civil liberties, multiple U.S. officials said.

Some administration officials said that making edits to intelligence reports is commonplace, adding that the N.S.A. document was later republished, stripping the identifying information from it. But other officials disputed that account and said there was no evidence an updated report was produced or circulated.

The N.S.A. report appears to have included information about Mr. Grenell that was collected by the spy agency. It is not clear whether that involved conversations between two foreigners or conversations Mr. Grenell had directly with Mr. Maduro. The N.S.A. is not supposed to deliberately target the messages of Americans for surveillance, but it nevertheless collects communications involving or about Americans while targeting foreigners abroad.

Mr. Grenell declined to comment. The National Security Agency and a White House official did not comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Grenell has been at odds with Mr. Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, over the Trump administration’s policy on Venezuela.

Mr. Grenell has pushed for a deal-making approach that seeks reaching agreements with the Maduro government that could benefit American energy companies. Mr. Rubio has taken a much harder line, vetoing any energy deals, and supported the more militaristic approach the administration is currently pursuing with Venezuela.

A deal to release hostages held in the country fell apart this year, after Mr. Grenell and Mr. Rubio’s State Department pursued separate deals. Mr. Grenell was pressing for an agreement that would have allowed American oil companies to do business in Venezuela. Chevron has been particularly interested in continuing its oil operations in Venezuela, a vital source of revenue for its authoritarian government. Mr. Rubio opposed that concession.

The initiative has proceeded along two tracks, one at the Justice Department’s civil rights division and another at its criminal division, seeking data about individual voters across the country, including names and addresses, in a move that experts say may violate the law. It is a significant break from decades of practice by Republican and Democratic administrations, which believed that doing so was federal overreach and ripe for abuse.

“Nobody has ever done anything like this,” said Justin Levitt, an election law expert at Loyola Marymount University’s law school and a former Justice Department official.

The Justice Department has requested data from at least 16 Republican-controlled states, including Mississippi, Alabama and Texas. It has also sent more formal demands for data to at least 17 mostly Democrat-controlled or swing states, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin and New York.

Nearly every state has resisted turning over voter files with private, personally identifiable information on voters like driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers. Last week, a local judge blocked South Carolina from releasing private voter information to the Justice Department.

In a private meeting with the staff of top state election officials last month, Michael Gates, a deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, disclosed that all 50 states would eventually receive similar requests, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times. In particular, he said, the federal government wants the last four digits of every voter’s Social Security number.

The administration plans to compare that voter data to a different database, maintained by the Department of Homeland Security, to see how many registered voters on the state lists match up with noncitizens listed by immigration agents, according to people familiar with the matter.

Justin R. Erickson, the general counsel for Minnesota’s secretary of state, raised fears that the data would be used to further the administration’s own priorities. In a letter last month to the Justice Department, he wrote, “Equally concerning is the possibility that the D.O.J. will use the data inappropriately and the fact that the D.O.J. does not appear to have complied with the necessary legal requirements to obtain or use data on several million people.”

Studies and state audits have found that noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent.

Mr. Levitt likened the effort to sending federal troops to bolster local police work. “It’s wading in, without authorization and against the law, with an overly heavy federal hand to take over a function that states are actually doing just fine,” he said, adding that “it’s wildly illegal, deeply troubling, and nobody asked for this.”

In a statement, a Justice Department spokesman, Gates McGavick, said, “Enforcing the nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the civil rights division.”

He cited longstanding voting laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Civil Rights Act, saying that it gave the department leeway to obtain the data. Doing so will “ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections,” Mr. McGavick added.

Already, the Justice Department has made extraordinary moves in the name of election integrity. It has unsuccessfully sought access to voting machines in Missouri and weighed the possibility of pursuing criminal investigations of state election officials over how they have done their jobs.

A memo from the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities obtained by The Times detailed the request by the Justice Department to scrutinize equipment used in the 2020 election.

The memo states that “Missouri is now part of a multistate attempt by the Department of Justice to access, physically inspect and perhaps take physical custody of election equipment used in the 2020 November general election.” At least two counties in the state received a request from Andrew McCoy Warner, a Justice Department official.

The Missouri Independent earlier reported the requests for machines.

Employees at the agency have been clear that they are interested in a central, federal database of voter information. In a letter to multiple states, Scott Laragy and Paul Hayden, two prosecutors from the criminal division, asked to “discuss a potential information-sharing agreement” that would help the department investigate election fraud.

“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce federal election laws and protect the integrity of federal elections,” the lawyers wrote to election officials in Connecticut, according to records obtained by The Times. Multiple states, including Georgia and Nevada, received similar requests.

While the department has sought to gather all the data itself, Trump administration officials have also offered some states a slightly different option. In conversations with at least two states, prosecutors from the civil rights division asked election officials to simply run their entire voter list through the federal database for citizenship records, known as the SAVE database, that is housed by the Department of Homeland Security.

D.H.S. officials have also contacted election officials with a similar request, according to records obtained by The Times. North Carolina received a letter inviting it to the “soft launch” of a new functionality of the database using the last four digits of a Social Security number.

Mr. Levitt said requests by the Justice Department for states to explain how they maintain voter lists were aboveboard. But what officials are demanding from many states goes so far beyond that, he said, that the moves may violate the Privacy Act, a post-Watergate law that carries criminal penalties and forbids the federal government from gathering certain types of information about citizens without stating beforehand the purpose of the data collection.

When Mr. Gates, a top lawyer in the civil rights division, met with the staff of top state election officials, he said the purpose of collecting the data was to conduct tests and analysis to ensure total compliance with federal laws. He did not specify the type of test or analysis, though acknowledged that officials would be receptive to sharing more detail in conferring with individual states.

Adrian Fontes, the Democratic secretary of state in Arizona, voiced unease in a statement responding to Justice Department requests. “Arizona voters deserve to participate in elections without fear that their personal information will be collected and stored in federal systems without proper legal safeguards or transparency,” he wrote, adding that the demands “raise serious legal and constitutional concerns.”

Outside voting rights and good governance organizations expressed alarm that the moves signaled an overarching scheme by the Trump administration to interfere in the midterm elections.

“The biggest structural concern is using this information in an irresponsible manner to fuel the narrative that something is amiss in any election in which the preferred outcome is not the actual outcome,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Election officials also note that creating a federal database has its own complications. A state’s voter file is not a static document; new voter registrations, changes in address, deaths and other adjustments to voter rolls take place every day. A federal database would be out of date a day after any voter list was turned over to federal officials.

Even as states are mostly responsible for overseeing voter rolls, the executive branch has tried in the past to do so, most notably during the first Trump administration.

After the 2016 election, Mr. Trump created a commission charged with rooting out voter fraud, putting Kris Kobach, then the secretary of state in Kansas, in charge. But Mr. Kobach’s requests for sensitive voter information were nearly universally denied by election officials, and Mr. Trump abruptly shut down the commission in 2018.

This March, Mr. Trump, who has falsely claimed his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud, issued an executive order intended to force states to more aggressively examine its voter rolls.

The order suggests that any states that fail to comply could face lawsuits, or lose federal funding.

But almost every election official has steadfastly refused to hand over private data.

“Nowhere does the Constitution provide the president or the executive branch with any independent power to control or otherwise conscript states to carry out nonstatutory policy priorities of the president,” Shirley Weber, the Democratic secretary of state in California, wrote to the department in August, adding, “My office is not obligated to follow along.”

Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of the commonwealth in Pennsylvania, wrote that the department’s requests “represent a concerning attempt to expand the federal government’s role in our country’s electoral process.” Mr. Schmidt, like the leaders of other states, offered the Justice Department publicly available voter files, but denied the request for more sensitive, private information from voters.

Election experts and officials worry what else the Trump administration may try to do with the data. The Department of Government Efficiency tried to cross-reference various giant government data sets to accomplish a number of policy goals, including reviving false claims of extensive voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

At her confirmation hearing to become attorney general in January, Pam Bondi said she accepted “the result” of the 2020 election, but in the next breath suggested there were major problems with the vote.

“I saw many things” in Pennsylvania, she said. She had gone to Pennsylvania after the election to amplify misleading claims of mass voter fraud, including helping arrange a news conference at a Philadelphia-area business, Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Around that time, she told Fox News that “we know that ballots have been dumped,” and that she had heard “people were receiving ballots that were dead.”

In less than a year of the new administration, Mr. Levitt said, the Justice Department has burned so much of its credibility with the public and the courts that any of its findings under Ms. Bondi based on the voter roll data were unlikely to be persuasive.

“Ask how many people are satisfied with what the Justice Department has done on the Jeffrey Epstein files,” he said. “It’s not just among liberals that they have lost credibility.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/22/multimedia/09trump-news-promo-1020p/22dc-fed-explain-mwpg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:58:10.500972

The document contradicts claims by the agency that all 475 people arrested during the raid were working illegally or violating their visas.
He was at the Hyundai factory as a contractor with a South Korean company.
The raid angered the South Korean government, which announced billions of dollars of investment in the US following a new trade deal between the countries.
On Sunday, the South Korean and US governments negotiated a deal to take the arrested workers home.","At least one of the Korean workers swept up in a huge immigration raid on a Hyundai Motor factory site in Georgia last week was living and working legally in the US, according to an internal federal government document obtained by the Guardian.

Officials then “mandated” that he agree to be removed from the US despite not having violated his visa.

The document shows that immigration officials are aware that someone with a valid visa was among the people arrested during the raid at the Hyundai factory and taken to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention for removal proceedings, where the people arrested remained on Tuesday before expected deportation flights back to South Korea.

The document in question reports on the man’s case and was leaked exclusively to the Guardian. It was written by an Ice agent. The Guardian is redacting the identity of the man in question, who arrived in the US in June, because it has not been possible to reach him directly and it is unclear whether he has any legal representation.

The document says that immigration agents from Atlanta “determined that [redacted] entered into the United States in [redacted], with a valid B1/B2 visa and [redacted] was employed at HL-GA Battery Company LLC as a contractor from the South Korean company SFA. From statements made and queries in law enforcement databases, [redacted] has not violated his visa; however, the Atlanta Field Office Director has mandated [redacted] be presented as a Voluntary Departure. [Redacted] has accepted voluntary departure despite not violating his B1/B2 visa requirements.”

The internal file describes “an actual crime”, according to Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia – but with the crime allegedly being committed by the government, not the detainee in question. Kuck, who is representing a number of people arrested during last week’s raid, said it was illegal to detain a valid visa holder in this way.

“This is outrageous,” Kuck said.

The document contradicts claims by the agency that all 475 people arrested during the raid were working illegally or violating their visas. Attorneys scrambling in recent days to provide representation to the men detained had already claimed that immigrants with a valid working status were swept up alongside the people allegedly working unlawfully, and placed in removal proceedings. That view was backed up by an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.

The arrest “is illegal”, the official claimed in an interview with the Guardian. The government maintains it is the detainee who acted unlawfully.

It is not yet clear whether other people with valid visas were detained in the raid, nor how many were actually alleged to be working illegally at the factory.

Approximately 300 people arrested could be put on flights back to South Korea as early as Wednesday, according to one source familiar with events who requested anonymity to speak about what is going on behind the scenes. Non-Koreans arrested during the operation are expected to remain in Ice detention.

Last Thursday, Ice led a raid at the Hyundai battery factory under construction in Ellabell, near Savannah, Georgia, and arrested nearly 500 people, the majority of whom were from South Korea, part of a $12.6bn investment program in Georgia by the company. Construction had to be halted on the plant that is designed to supply batteries for electric vehicles.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the federal parent agency of Ice, said in a statement to the Guardian that: “This individual admitted to unauthorized work on a B1/B2 visa. He was offered voluntary departure and accepted it,” despite this being the opposite of what the leaked document says. When pressed for further clarification, the DHS reiterated its first statement. Ice did not respond to a request for comment about legal workers being arrested.

“This is a clear violation of the law in detaining somebody who is not lawfully detainable,” Kuck said. “That’s a crime – that’s unlawful imprisonment in the United States. This isn’t an accident. People go to prison for stuff like this.”

According to the file written by an agent with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), an agency within Ice, the man entered the US “with a valid B1/B2 visa”, which allows for some business-related activities and tourism. He was at the Hyundai factory as a contractor with a South Korean company.

“‘ Voluntarily’ means something different in immigration than it does in the real world,” Kuck said. “When you basically leave under Ice custody, then you have immigration consequences that come with that, including the loss of visa and possibly an inability to return [to the US].”

After the raid, additional Ice officers and agents were sent to the detention facility to process the sheer number of people arrested, according to the agency official who spoke to the Guardian.

Although officials say that the people arrested were in some violation of immigration laws, many others with valid legal status were offered voluntary departure, the official claimed. The official added that it was unclear what would happen with any legal immigrants who refuse to be deported voluntarily, since there is “no legal mechanism to remove them if they are not in violation” of US civil immigration laws. There is no suggestion that the Korean man in question has a criminal record in the US.

“The arrest itself is illegal and this just might be a way of pushing up [arrest] numbers and covering up mistakes,” the official added.

The raid angered the South Korean government, which announced billions of dollars of investment in the US following a new trade deal between the countries. On Sunday, the South Korean and US governments negotiated a deal to take the arrested workers home.

The wanted stood outside of a U-Haul truck rental outlet in the San Gabriel Valley. They polished other people’s BMWs and Range Rovers at a Pasadena car wash. I saw the wanted women too, walking to jobs as nannies and housekeepers.

They looked suspicious, all right, by the definition outlined Monday by Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. They were natives of Mexico and Central America, seeking “certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction.”

They were suspect to many Californians too, but only of wanting to work, wanting to earn a little cash, wanting to pay their bills and feed their families. One hundred and seventy five years to the day after land that once belonged to Mexico became the 31st American state, California felt to many people Tuesday like it had reverted to a kind of frontier justice, where racial profiling had become the law of the land.

“I am just working hard and paying taxes,” said Mario, 50, between sips of coffee on the sidewalk outside the U-Haul station. Even before the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids began three months ago, the Honduran immigrant said, life for street-corner workers was not easy.

“People are just looking for work. Some of them are even homeless,” said Mario, who declined to give his last name. “But some people are showing them hate, sometimes even hitting or kicking the homeless. We see it out on the street.”

At the Pasadena car wash where six workers were carted away in late August, those left behind continued their buffing and polishing Tuesday.

“It feels like we have come down low, really low,” said Cesar, between checking in customers. Though he was born just blocks away at Pasadena’s Huntington Hospital, he said he does not feel immune from the raids.

“If now they are just going to judge you by how you look, or maybe how you talk, I can get pulled over. Anyone can get pulled over,” said Cesar, who did not give his last name. “It’s gonna be harder for people to live a normal life. They’re gonna just have to deal with harassment. That’s not something I would want anyone to have to go through.”

Earlier raids by Trump immigration agents have spread far beyond snagging the criminals and drug traffickers the president and his allies claimed to be after. With 10 million Latinos living in the seven Southern California counties covered by the court’s order, a rights group said the high court’s action cleared the way for “an extraordinarily expansive dragnet, placing millions of law-abiding people at imminent risk of detention by federal agents.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

The action offered portentous echoes of the mistreatment and greater violence unleashed on Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s. Today, it had U.S.-born citizens, such as The Times’ Gustavo Arellano, feeling they will have to carry their passports to prove their citizenship.

Outside the U-Haul, Mario said he holds a green card. So he will continue waiting on the sidewalk for his next job.

“I believe in God,” he said. “We might think different things, but we all have the same heart. There should be the same heart for everyone. Everyone.”

""We get a tip from the hotline, or if we see something on social media, and our responsibility is to check out if it really is an ICE sighting. This is our first defense to combat fear in the community,"" Bautista told CBS News.

Southside neighborhoods targeted by ICE have been noticeably quiet, as many residents fear for themselves, their friends and their family. Community organizers say they have even postponed Mexican Independence Day events to protect people.

Lawyers argue Trump's decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Labor unions representing millions of educators and school employees are suing President Donald Trump's administration over its immigration crackdown, saying arrests near school campuses are terrorizing children and their teachers, leading some students to drop out.

At the start of Trump's second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools — long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent more than 4 million school employees nationwide.

Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student's father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn't hear the commotion outside.

Teacher Lauren Fong, who teaches the child whose father was arrested that day, said she was troubled by the decision to confront the father in the school parking lot, which is private property.

“Why a school? Why not someplace else, any place else?"" Fong said in an interview. “It was in the parking lot, where it could be witnessed by so many young children.”

The educators are joining a lawsuit filed in April by an Oregon farmworker union and a group of churches, challenging the Trump administration's decision to open houses of worship to immigration enforcement as well. The amended lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Eugene, Oregon.

A request for comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.

For nearly three decades, immigration agents were instructed to steer clear of “sensitive locations” like schools, hospitals and places of worship, except under extraordinary circumstances. Homeland Security, according to a 2021 memo, could “accomplish (its) enforcement mission without denying or limiting individuals’ access to needed medical care, children access to their schools, the displaced access to food and shelter, people of faith access to their places of worship.""

A day after Trump took office, the department rescinded the memo and instead urged agents to use “common sense” when operating near schools and churches. In a statement, officials outlined their reasoning behind the move: ""Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”

The lawsuit describes several instances of masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement making arrests in and around school and church grounds. In Los Angeles, masked border patrol officers descended on a car parked next to a high school and ordered a 15-year-old boy with disabilities out at gunpoint while searching for a man with gang ties. They handcuffed him and only released him when they discovered they had the wrong person.

The lawsuit includes testimonials from unnamed teachers who report seeing increased anxiety and decreased participation and attendance from students who are either immigrants or the children of immigrants.

High school teachers in Pennsylvania and Virginia said some students stopped showing up in the spring, fearful they would be arrested on campus. A speech pathologist at a California elementary school said immigrant parents were reluctant to sign up their children for special education services because it would mean giving more information to the school. A Texas high school teacher for students learning English said enrollment in her classes has dropped precipitously.

“America’s classrooms must be safe and welcoming places of learning and discovery,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT.

Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said the Trump administration is creating fear and chaos and ""our students, schools, and communities are paying the price.”

Leaders in the heavily immigrant churches that sued also described increased anxiety and a drop in Mass attendance.

Lawyers argue Trump's decision to open up churches to immigration enforcement violates the First Amendment rights of parishioners because it makes them too fearful to attend church. Rescinding the sensitive-locations memo, the lawsuit says, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which bars agencies from implementing policies that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”

The incident in Ann Arbor mirrors other widely reported cases in which ICE agents have detained parents near schools, raising concerns among educators, parents and local officials about the potential emotional effects on children.
What To Know Federal immigration agents took Osorio into custody after he dropped his son off at Lakewood Elementary School on September 4, according to the news outlet MLive.
""What triggered a lot of people is that it happened near the school,"" Osorio told MLive.
Both ICE and Ann Arbor Public Schools told MLive that federal authorities did not enter school grounds and no students witnessed agents taking Osorio.","Rodrigo Osorio, a 31-year-old father, was taken into federal immigration custody after he dropped his son off at a school in Ann Arbor, Michigan, last week.

Osorio, who was released later that day, was held in custody at an immigration facility in Detroit for about eight hours before his release, reports said.

Why It Matters

Policy changes under President Donald Trump's administration have loosened restrictions that previously required Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to obtain prior approval before arresting individuals at ""sensitive locations,"" such as schools, hospitals and churches.

According to critics, enforcement actions have since increased in and around those places. The incident in Ann Arbor mirrors other widely reported cases in which ICE agents have detained parents near schools, raising concerns among educators, parents and local officials about the potential emotional effects on children.

What To Know

Federal immigration agents took Osorio into custody after he dropped his son off at Lakewood Elementary School on September 4, according to the news outlet MLive.

He told the outlet that he was a block away from the school when he saw the lights of a few vehicles and pulled to the side to allow them to pass. But they stopped and apprehended him instead.

Osorio, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 7 and has lived most of his life in the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti areas of Michigan, has been protected from removal under DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, since 2012.

""What triggered a lot of people is that it happened near the school,"" Osorio told MLive. ""That they waited for me to drop my kid off and pick me up.""

""My kid is pretty traumatized out of this, I would say. He's been asking me, 'Are they gonna come pick you up again?' He asked, 'Who picked you up? What's going on?' And I don't think an 8-year-old should be concerned about [that].""

""It's just been pretty hard in a way,"" he added.

Osorio said he was never provided a reason for his detainment, adding that federal authorities ""kept changing up the story.""

Both ICE and Ann Arbor Public Schools told MLive that federal authorities did not enter school grounds and no students witnessed agents taking Osorio.

In a statement on Friday, an ICE spokesperson told MLive that Osorio was found ""not amenable to removal for the United States"" upon further review.

Federal officials said that claims of individuals being apprehended as part of broader, school-based ""raids"" were completely inaccurate. A Department of Homeland Security memo issued on Tuesday described such reports as ""fake news.""

""After media force-feeding the public stories about parents and children being scared to return to school, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is setting the record straight: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does NOT raid or target schools,"" the memo said.

It added that the DHS directive that allows ICE to go into schools ""gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs.""

""Our agents use discretion,"" the memo continued. ""Officers would need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.""

What People Are Saying

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: ""The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement. These smears are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them. ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or 'raiding,' schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.

""Criminals are no longer be able to hide in America's schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2718841/ice.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:57:45.418321

But its decision this week to lift a lower court injunction barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting raids around Los Angeles by armed and masked agents engaged in racial profiling is among the most shameful.
The Court said Lyons could sue for damages based on the actual chokehold, but not for an injunction against future police practices.
Under these circumstances, the Court had every reason to doubt that Lyons needed the protection of a court order barring the future use of chokeholds against him.
As Sotomayor says, what the plaintiffs proved in the trial court about ICE’s conduct is “unconscionably irreconcilable with our Nation’s constitutional guarantees.” This Court is not meeting the challenge.","By now, it’s routine for the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts to misuse its so-called emergency docket to short-circuit lower court orders blocking the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-constitutionalism. But its decision this week to lift a lower court injunction barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from conducting raids around Los Angeles by armed and masked agents engaged in racial profiling is among the most shameful. In the context of affirmative action, this Court has piously opined: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Yet when it comes to immigration, the Court will allow ICE to proceed for now as if any brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking, low-wage worker in central California is reasonably suspected of being deportable.

The public owes Justice Brett Kavanaugh some gratitude for explaining his vote in concurrence with the majority; often, the Court’s “emergency” orders arrive simply as unsigned riddles. His opinion, however, is deeply unpersuasive. Still, it provides a service by presenting both the Court’s seemingly blinkered understanding of the practices in dispute and its disregard for the role of trial judges in fact-finding decisions.

The case in question, Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem in the lower courts, was filed as a potential class action brought by five individual plaintiffs and three membership organizations. They proved to the satisfaction of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that senior federal immigration officials working in and around Los Angeles had authorized ICE agents to stop and detain individuals for interrogation based entirely on four highly generalized factors: (1) their apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work. In other words, instead of responding to a “reasonable suspicion” that might legally justify individual stops, ICE was detaining people based on characteristics likely to describe a great many innocent people. Justice Sonia Sotomayor explains in her dissent that the Fourth Amendment does not allow stops based on criteria that broad. Yet in Central California, a judicial district where nearly half the population identifies as Latino or Hispanic, there are quite likely millions of U.S. citizens and fully documented alien residents whom such an indiscriminate, ethnicity-based filter would catch. The Ninth Circuit had already declined to stay the District Court’s injunction barring ICE’s practice, viewing the plaintiffs as likely to prevail after a full trial and judging that the government would suffer no irreparable harm while its four-factor searches were suspended.

Kavanaugh, to the contrary, argues that the government is likely to prevail on two issues. One is whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue—in other words, did their allegations raise a sufficient likelihood of imminent harm to warrant an injunction barring interrogation stops that have not yet occurred? But “standing” is a notoriously malleable doctrine, and the case Kavanaugh cites as relevant precedent for the government quite easily supports the opposite conclusion.

City of Los Angeles v. Lyons is a 1983 case involving a motorist stopped for a vehicle code violation. Despite offering no resistance to officers, Adolph Lyons was placed in a chokehold that rendered him unconscious and damaged his larynx. He sought both damages for his injury and an injunction against the use of chokeholds by the police. The Court said Lyons could sue for damages based on the actual chokehold, but not for an injunction against future police practices. Lyons, the majority concluded, had not proved “a sufficient likelihood that he [would] again be wronged” by the police employing excessive force.

Lyons and Vasquez Perdomo are fundamentally different. Because Lyons was suing only as an individual, speculation about future harm could focus only on him personally. The plaintiffs in Perdomo are asking the trial court to allow them to proceed as a class action on behalf of “[a]ll persons who, since June 6, 2025, have been or will be subjected to detentive stop by federal agents in the District without a pre-stop, individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion concerning whether the person (1) is engaged in an offense against the United States or (2) is a noncitizen unlawfully in the United States.” There are thousands, if not millions, of people whose futures are at stake.

Moreover, by the time Lyons’s case was heard in 1982, the Los Angeles Police Department had adopted a ban on “bar-arm chokeholds” and entered into a moratorium—since made permanent—against “carotid artery” holds, except in circumstances that would justify the use of lethal force. Under these circumstances, the Court had every reason to doubt that Lyons needed the protection of a court order barring the future use of chokeholds against him. As for Vasquez Perdomo, Justice Sotomayor describes the vastly different policy orientation at stake: “Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has called the District Judge an ‘idiot’ and vowed that ‘none of [the Government’s] operations are going to change.’ The CBP Chief Patrol Agent in the Central District has stated that his division will ‘turn and burn’ and ‘go even harder now,’ and has posted videos on social media touting his agents’ continued efforts, chasing, cuffing, [and] deporting’ people at car washes.” Against this background, any brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking Californian appearing to work in a low-wage occupation or even waiting for a bus has reasonable cause to fear being stopped by a federal agency running amok.

Kavanaugh suggests that the government will likely prevail on the argument that its four factors are sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. After all, he argues, it is probable that many of the undocumented aliens in California come from Mexico or Central America, “do not speak much English,” and seek employment in a predictable set of jobs that “do not require paperwork.” None of this negates the fact, however, that without some additional factor—for example, the record of a particular employer in hiring undocumented persons—these elements alone are likely to describe a large percentage of the low-wage workforce in Central California, documented or not.

Finally, under Supreme Court precedent, emergency relief for the Trump administration should require a showing that the so-called balance of equities—weighing the harms caused to the government by the injunction versus the interests at stake for the defendants—is tilted in the government’s favor. In conducting his own balancing, Kavanaugh drastically minimizes the interests of the detained individuals. Undocumented persons who are detained, he claims, do not have any “especially weighty legal interest” in avoiding interrogation based on ICE’s criteria. Persons lawfully present, he says, face only “questioning” that is “typically brief.” They will “promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.” Unfortunately, the District Court record shows that the second of these claims is untrue. And Kavanaugh’s accounting does not acknowledge the reasonable fear and apprehension of millions of law-abiding Californians who fit the “suspect” criteria and are stigmatized by ICE’s policies.

In Trump v. Hawaii, the Court’s 2018 decision upholding the so-called “Muslim ban” imposed by the first Trump administration, Chief Justice Roberts took umbrage at the suggestion in a Sotomayor dissent that the majority was making an error of judgment akin to the Court’s infamous Korematsu decision. Yet one paragraph in the Kavanaugh opinion struck me as worthy of a similar rebuke. He writes: “To the extent that excessive force has been used, the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action … I agree with the dissent on that point. But … this injunction against brief stops for questioning does not address the use of force issue.”

Korematsu legitimized the decision of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration to place Japanese-Americans in internment camps because, the authorities claimed, it was too difficult to sort out the loyal from the disloyal as individuals. But Justices in the majority denied they were doing any such thing. Fred Korematsu had been convicted only of violating a so-called exclusion order, requiring him to leave the San Leandro area but not specifying where he was to go. The Court refused to “pass at this time upon the whole subsequent detention program in both assembly and relocation centers,” because “the only issues framed at the trial related to petitioner’s remaining in the prohibited area in violation of the exclusion order.” In other words, the majority could not be expected to recognize that Japanese-Americans were effectively being moved into internment camps by “excluding” them from everywhere except the camps themselves and where they would be assembled for transport.

Kavanaugh implicitly endorses a similar inattention. As Sotomayor wrote this week: “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.” Kavanaugh’s opinion implicitly asks readers to keep this reality outside their field of vision.

We do not know whether the five Justices other than Kavanaugh who are also content to leave ICE undisciplined are motivated by the standing issue, the Fourth Amendment issue, or a disinclination to confront the Trump administration in a case where it might choose outright defiance of the high court. But their unexplained votes do them no credit. As Sotomayor says, what the plaintiffs proved in the trial court about ICE’s conduct is “unconscionably irreconcilable with our Nation’s constitutional guarantees.” This Court is not meeting the challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25212621113523-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1587&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-10 11:58:22.881837

Reporting from Washington

Former Vice President Kamala Harris opened up about former President Joe Biden’s decision to seek re-election in her forthcoming campaign memoir, writing that deferring to the Bidens to make the decision on their own was “recklessness.”

“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris said.

“Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,” she continued. “The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”

The comments in Harris’ upcoming book “107 Days” mark her harshest criticism of the Bidens’ circle yet, laying bare divisions in the White House and grappling with the former president’s decision to seek a second term despite widespread concerns over his age.

Trump called this morning for the suspect accused of fatally stabbing a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, to face the death penalty.

""The ANIMAL who so violently killed the beautiful young lady from Ukraine, who came to America searching for peace and safety, should be given a 'Quick' (there is no doubt!) Trial, and only awarded THE DEATH PENALTY. There can be no other option!!!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., who's been accused of fatally stabbing Iryna Zarutska in August, was charged yesterday with the federal crime of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. The Department of Justice said that if convicted, he could either face life in prison without parole or the death penalty.

Court records show that Brown has a criminal history spanning more than a decade and some have questioned whether he has mental health issues.

Even before his second term began, Trump called for expanded use of the death penalty across the country. After he was sworn in, he signed an executive order that directed the attorney general to pursue the death penalty “for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.”

Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., are renewing their call for the U.S. to ramp up sanctions on Russia after its recent strike on Kyiv.

In a statement from the senators, who serve as co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, they said that Russia ""deliberately struck EU diplomatic facilities and other Western assets in Kyiv — a calculated provocation against America’s allies.""

They said that as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates the war in Ukraine, the U.S. ""appears to be cutting back"" certain programs, such as some that are ""lifelines for NATO’s eastern flank.""

""The message this sends is dangerous: that the United States is pulling back just as the stakes in Ukraine and for NATO’s security are at their highest,"" they said. ""Our adversaries are taking note that they can wait out American support — that does not make America safer.""

Poland also said earlier today that during an attack on Ukraine, Russian drones had entered theNATO countrty's airspace and were shot down.

The Senate Banking Committee will vote this morning on the nomination of Stephen Miran to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.

Democrats have been demanding that he resign from his job as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers if he's confirmed by the Senate. Miran, however, testified last week that he plans only to take a leave of absence from his current job instead of resigning.

The Council of Economic Advisers is an agency within the White House that advises the president on economic policy, while the Federal Reserve is supposed to maintain independence within the government. If confirmed, Miran would hold a spot on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates and the Federal Reserve is soon expected to cut them.

Trump nominated Stephen Miran in August to fill the seat of Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her 14-year term that expires in January. At that point, Miran would need to be re-nominated and re-confirmed in order to continue to serve on the board.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke with his Chinese counterpart via video teleconference from the Pentagon yesterday, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the call.

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell later confirmed the call, saying the two officials ""exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner.""

""Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,"" Parnell said. ""At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.""

This is the first time Hegseth is known to have spoken with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun. There was potential for them to meet at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May, but Dong did not attend, instead sending a delegation of other officials.

At the conference, Hegseth called on U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific to increase their defense spending to counter the threat from China.

“There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,” Hegseth said.

Beijing criticized his speech, labeling it divisive.

Hegseth’s call with Dong comes just weeks before Trump could meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit in South Korea late next month.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican Vivek Ramaswamy has landed another labor endorsement in his bid to be Ohio’s next governor.

The Central Midwest Regional Council of Carpenters, which represents 37,000 trade workers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky announced its support for the Trump-backed candidate today.

“The CMRCC appreciates your commitment and support to our member’s priorities and values,” Jason Clark, the group's senior political adviser, wrote in an endorsement letter to Ramaswamy that was shared first with NBC News. “Your leadership and dedication to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women we represent is well documented. We look forward to working with you and further strengthening our relationship.”

It’s the third union endorsement in recent weeks for Ramaswamy, an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2024 who later helped Trump and Elon Musk establish the federal Department of Government of Efficiency. In recent days the biotech entrepreneur has also secured support from the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council and the Cleveland Building & Construction Trades Council.

“The carpenters, millwrights and skilled tradespeople of Ohio represent the engine that drives our economy,” Ramaswamy said in a statement shared by his campaign. “As governor, I will work to expand vocational training, partner with CMRCC on their priorities, and invest in infrastructure so that union workers and all Ohioans can thrive.”

The carpenters group has a mixed partisan record when it comes to endorsements. Last year, for example, the union backed Democrat Kamala Harris for president but Republican Mike Braun for governor of Indiana. In Ohio the union endorsed then-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, in his unsuccessful re-election campaign. The carpenters also supported Democrat Tim Ryan in his unsuccessful 2022 Senate race against future Vice President JD Vance.

Ryan is considering a run for governor in 2026 and expects to make a decision in the coming weeks. Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio’s former health director, is already seeking the Democratic nomination. Incumbent Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is term-limited.

“The other side is still trying to get their partisan endorsements in order, trying to figure out who’s going to be running,” said Jai Chabria, Ramaswamy’s chief strategist.

Ramaswamy, he added, has “already unified the Republican Party, and is actually looking toward the general election, and he’s making very big inroads in to win there. And I am pretty proud of that right now.”

Trump told reporters last night that he plans to announce a crime crackdown in another city “probably tomorrow.”

He made the remarks as he was lauding his administration’s crackdown in Washington while he was going into dinner at tJoe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab in downtown D.C.

He added that he loved working with Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith. Fellow Democrats rebuked Bowser last month after she said crime in the district has gone down since Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement in the city.

A bipartisan group of staffers from the House Oversight Committee will travel to New York City today to meet with lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein’s estate and view unredacted versions of the documents the estate is turning over to the committee, according to a source familiar with the visit.

NBC News has reported that materials the estate is transmitting are redacted but that the committee staff members will be able to view the original unredacted versions in person.

“As agreed with the Committee, the Co-Executors will make the original ‘birthday book’ and unredacted versions of documents, records and other materials available to Committee members and their staff for their personal examination and review,” the lawyers for the Epstein estate wrote in their production cover letter to the committee yesterday.

The lawyers referred to the materials transmitted yesterday as the “first production of documents.”

Asked yesterday when the next batch of documents will be turned over, one of the lawyers, Daniel Weiner, told NBC News in a statement: “As agreed with the House Oversight Committee, the Estate is making a rolling production of documents responsive to the Committee’s subpoena. We hope to be producing additional documents soon.”

Trump’s rare outing to a local restaurant last night got off to a rocky start tonight when he came face to face with protesters.

Trump, accompanied by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other administration officials, arrived by motorcade at Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab less than a quarter-mile from the White House.

Trump briefly spoke to reporters on the street outside the restaurant, where he was met with cheers and some chants of “free Palestine.”

Once he was inside, as he greeted restaurant patrons, a group of protesters holding Palestinian flags began chanting, “Free D.C., free Palestine, Trump is the Hitler of our time.”

The seat that had been vacant since Rep. Gerry Connolly, who had esophageal cancer, died in May at age 75. Walkinshaw spent a decade as a top aide to Connolly.

Democrats will have 213 representatives in the House once Walkinshaw is sworn in, while Republicans have 219 representatives, with three seats still vacant because of deaths and resignations. A number of key votes loom on the horizon.

If only aggressive policing is used, it most likely will bring frustration and conflict between the community and law enforcement, he said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — One month after President Donald Trump’s law enforcement surge in the nation’s capital, there may be less crime. There are fewer guns on the streets and fewer homeless encampments, according to official figures. But for some who work or live in Washington, D.C., the operation has sparked fear and prompted a change in how they see their place in the United States — and how they think the United States sees them.

Without an extension by Congress, the 30-day emergency declaration issued by President Trump that federalized the district’s police force expires Wednesday. The National Guard deployment continues, at least for now.

With Trump now setting his sights on Chicago and Baltimore, all eyes are on the District on Columbia and how it emerges from this unprecedented takeover.

Here are some takeaways from the emergency period:

Crime appears to have gone down. But it was already falling

The president has lauded his surge as a resounding success. But reality is less clear cut.

According to data released by the White House, there have been more than 2,100 arrests from August 7, when federal law enforcement began their deployment, through September 8.

The White House says those include 20 suspected gang members, including several from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua groups. In addition, 222 firearms have been seized and 50 homeless encampments dismantled, according to the White House.

Metropolitan Police Department figures show that violent crime during the surge was down 39% from the same period last year, including a 53% drop in homicides, with seven during the surge, compared to 15 during the same timespan in 2024.

The roughly 2,000 guard members from D.C. and seven states have largely patrolled Metro stations and the main transit hub, Union Station, while occasionally cleaning up litter.

Brian Levin, professor emeritus of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino, said crime was already in decline according to a report issued in January by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. The surge likely intensified that, although it is hard to say by how much, he said.

“D.C. is one of the smaller cities in the United States. It’s easier to police,” Levin said. “This might not work elsewhere.”

For Trump, projecting a tough on crime image may be helping him politically, at least for the moment. His overall approval rating increased slightly, from 40% in July to 45% a month later, according to an AP-NORC poll from late August, at a time when 81% of Americans see crime as a “major problem” in large cities.

D.C.’s mayor caught between Trump and her voters

Mayor Muriel Bowser has mostly avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks against the president that has been typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders.

Instead, she cooperated with the administration’s efforts, including having MPD officers work more closely with federal immigration agents, as Trump has demanded. Last week, in a nod to continued collaboration, she issued an order to continue the work of an emergency operations center the city set up in response to the federal law enforcement surge.

She also backed up the administration’s claims on the success of the surge. Bowser said crime was falling before Trump issued the emergency order. But she acknowledged the federal surge had a “significant” impact on crime.

Speaking at a press conference on Aug. 27, the mayor said that carjackings were down 87% since the same 20-day period last year.

“We know that when carjackings go down, when use of guns goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason.”

Her approach is a stark contrast to other, more oppositional Democratic leaders in Chicago or L.A. It highlights how much D.C. is subject to the whims of the federal government. The district is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 but federal political leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council. Republicans, who control both chambers, have already frozen more than $1 billion in local spending, slashing the city’s budget in the middle of the financial year.

City council members, however, have shown less restraint, and were fiercely critical of the surge. Last week, the district, led by its elected attorney general, asked a federal court to intervene in the takeover, which it called a “forced military occupation.”

The nation’s capital is taking stock of its future

If, as anticipated, the emergency is not extended by Congress, the MPD will no longer be under the president’s authority and participating in federal operations, like immigration roundups.

“The MPD is not compelled to provide MPD services as directed by the president. That’s what changes,” Bowser said on Monday. “Shooting somebody? Still illegal. Committing carjackings? Still illegal. Stealing from stores? Still illegal. That won’t change on September 11. It will be illegal.”

In practical terms, what citizens see might not change much. D.C. guard members’ orders have been extended through December, and they are under the president’s direct command, unlike in the states where governors command their National Guard contingents. Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said he plans to send another 300 guard members to D.C. in the coming weeks to support law enforcement.

Asked about future plans, a White House spokeswoman said the details of the continued law enforcement involvement “are subject to change to meet law enforcement needs as the operation continues.”

James Nolan, professor of sociology at West Virginia University, said it remained to be seen whether the influx of law enforcement is sustainable or addresses underlying problems.

“Things that are related to crime are also related to physical and mental and emotional health issues,” he said. If only aggressive policing is used, it most likely will bring frustration and conflict between the community and law enforcement, he said.

The surge may have damaged community relationships

The takeover, with uniformed and armed Guardsmen patrolling Metro stations, tourist sites and neighborhoods, unnerved many residents. In one storied D.C. neighborhood with a traditionally high crime rate, residents felt they wanted more law enforcement, but not the kind Trump had deployed, especially as it came with the use of masked ICE officers taking people into custody.

“What relationships do we have to repair once this surge is over?” asked senior police commander Jaron Hickman.

At a protest Saturday against the surge that drew thousands, two women, both immigrants, said fear stemming from the surge was alienating the community.

Laura, 43, who migrated from Mexico 25 years ago, said she has encountered immigration enforcement officers three times in the past month, most recently at a checkpoint on one of the city’s main thoroughfares, New York Avenue. A restaurant worker, she said avoided them by taking a side street.

Guadalupe, 49, who like Laura, did not want to share her last name or be photographed out of fear of retribution, said she tried to get her grown children to come to the protest but they were wary. “They are American but they have Latino faces,” she said, adding that she came to the U.S. from El Salvador when she was 18.

“I’m legal in this country, but still I’m a scared because I have a Latino face,” she said. “I feel we don’t have any rights in this country anymore.”

In San Diego, ICE agents began arresting people in immigration court on May 22.
Courthouse arrests are part of a larger legal strategy meant to speed up Trump’s mass deportation campaign.","A San Diego law firm filed a class action lawsuit late last week asking a federal judge to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting asylum seekers at immigration court.

“We’re asking the judge to declare that the agency’s behavior is unlawful,” said Kimberly Hutchison, a civil rights lawyer with locally based Singleton Schreiber.

The firm filed the suit on behalf of two asylum seekers who were arrested at San Diego’s immigration court earlier this year. The class action argues that courthouse arrests violate the constitutional rights of asylum seekers and delegitimize the integrity of the legal process.

“You can’t just take away someone’s liberty without giving the process to determine whether that is an appropriate decision,” Hutchison said. “They are doing it across the board and that’s a violation of due process.”

The class, as defined in the lawsuit, is limited to people actively seeking asylum who do not have a criminal record and have already been determined not to be a flight or public safety risk.

Neither of the two asylum seekers identified in the lawsuit have a criminal record. They also regularly attended all their immigration court hearings, Hutchison said.

“These are the quintessential people that can be trusted to remain out in the community,” she added.

Aside from claiming to erode trust in the immigration court system, lawyers argue courthouse arrests are traumatizing to their clients by subjecting them to unnecessary detention.

ICE did not respond to questions from KPBS about the lawsuit.

An abrupt change in policy

During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) explicitly prohibited courthouse arrests.

According to a 2021 memo, the agency explained its rationale against courthouse arrests, “so as to not unnecessarily impinge upon the core principle of preserving access to justice.” The memo explicitly defined a “courthouse” as any municipal, county, state, federal, tribal, or immigration court.

But in January, Trump administration officials suspended the 2021 memorandum and a separate Biden-era policy against arresting individuals in sensitive areas like schools, hospitals and courthouses.

In San Diego, ICE agents began arresting people in immigration court on May 22.

Courthouse arrests are part of a larger legal strategy meant to speed up Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The strategy involves government lawyers asking immigration judges to dismiss immigration cases of people who have been in the country less than two years. Once those cases are dismissed, ICE agents can rearrest those individuals and place them in a fast-track deportation process called expedited removal.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/571e6d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F49%2F2ffd762449058a780baad510c9a4%2Fice-in-hallway.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:57:31.310923

Abraham died in a hit-and-run on Jan. 9 in Urbana, Ill., after an alleged drunk driver, who police say was undocumented, hit the 20-year-old’s vehicle with an SUV.

Days after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the D.C. police chief, Pamela A. Smith, issued an order to her department, outlining the extent to which officers could cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.
For her to publicly reassure immigrants in the city, he said, would risk triggering a new round of intervention from the Trump administration.
Two days later, she declined to offer unequivocal support when Mr. Schwalb sued the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.","One month ago, President Trump declared that “crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor” in Washington, D.C., represented such a dire emergency that he was placing the local police department “under direct federal control.” The announcement, coming a year and a half into a steady decline in D.C.’s violent crime rates, was one of the most aggressive encroachments on Washington’s self-government since Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act more than five decades ago.

At the stroke of midnight on Wednesday, that particular intervention will end. The 30-day window that temporarily grants presidents great powers in the city’s affairs will come to a close, a moment that city officials and many residents have been looking to as a sort of deliverance after four surreal weeks.

But it is unclear how much, if anything, will immediately change.

The end of the 30-day period has no bearing on the thousands of National Guard troops, drawn from the District of Columbia itself and from eight Republican-led states, who have been deployed to Washington. Neither does it directly affect the hundreds of additional federal law enforcement officers — from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies — who have been sent out into the city to patrol. And U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will continue to take people into custody around Washington, as they did long before the emergency was declared.

Congress is marking the last day of the emergency by taking up a range of legislation that would eat away at D.C.’s self-government, including bills that would expand federal oversight, cancel local laws and eliminate some locally elected positions. (Although the district has about 500,000 eligible voters, they do not have congressional representation.)

For now, the specter of ever-greater federal control over the city, even if it has loomed particularly large over the past month, is going nowhere.

“With this administration and this particular crop of individuals in the Congress, you give an inch, they will take a mile,” said Christina Henderson, a member at large of the District of Columbia Council. “This is a group of people that require you to have your head on a swivel at all times.”

The Wednesday night deadline pertains only to presidential authority over local police, as detailed in the 1973 Home Rule Act, and even this authority is not as comprehensive as the White House has claimed.

The Trump administration was never actually able to take over the Metropolitan Police Department, though Mr. Trump and Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, declared their intention to do so. Days after the announcement, Brian Schwalb, the elected D.C. attorney general, filed a lawsuit arguing that the law didn’t give presidents the authority to take full control of the police department, only the authority to direct the mayor to provide certain police services for a declared federal emergency.

Facing hostile questions from a federal judge, the administration backed down from its broadest claims to power. After talks with the city, the Justice Department issued an order listing the services that the Trump administration was demanding, chiefly involving immigration enforcement.

That is one of the few things that will be different, on paper at least, on Thursday: The local police, whose cooperation with federal immigration enforcement is strictly limited under D.C. law, will no longer be compelled to cooperate with ICE.

But police operations on the ground might not change right away. Days after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the D.C. police chief, Pamela A. Smith, issued an order to her department, outlining the extent to which officers could cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

Tom Lynch, a spokesman for the police department, said that the order currently remains in place, and he declined to comment on what might happen after the deadline.

Phil Mendelson, the chairman of the D.C. Council, said he believed that the degree of police cooperation with ICE would wind down, though not at the stroke of midnight. “I think what we’re going to see is a slow and gradual transition,” he said. “I don’t think there will be a night-and-day separation.”

People who work with local immigrant communities said that the involvement of local police with ICE over the past month had undone years of community work by city officials.

“D.C. has made a lot of great efforts to have a Latino liaison,” said Abel Núñez, the executive director of Carecen, a social services organization for Latino immigrants. Police reassured immigrants that they could safely report domestic abuse or come forward with witness accounts about violent crime, he said. Now, “it’ll take years to rebuild that trust.”

Mr. Núñez said he expected that city leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, would probably not begin repairing that break right away. For her to publicly reassure immigrants in the city, he said, would risk triggering a new round of intervention from the Trump administration.

“She’s measuring what’s best for the overall city from her perspective,” he said. “That means that as immigrants we are left in a very vulnerable situation.”

Republicans in Congress are set to discuss more than a dozen bills concerning the District of Columbia on Wednesday, some of them seeking to permanently expand the federal government’s already considerable power over the city. Even without new legislation, the ability of the city to run its affairs remains precarious: Earlier this year, House Republicans declined to insert a routine clause pertaining to Washington in a budget resolution, leaving D.C. with a $1.1 billion funding shortfall.

There is also a lingering fear among D.C. officials, usually raised in whispers, that the president could simply decide to declare another emergency at any time, starting a new 30-day window of federal intrusion.

Mayor Bowser has said repeatedly that the city’s vulnerability required her to be strategic in dealing with the administration, a stance that has drawn criticism from residents and other elected officials who are urging a more confrontational stance. Last week, she announced the formation of a “Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” to help coordinate with the federal law enforcement agencies — not including ICE — that have sent officers to do police work in the city. Two days later, she declined to offer unequivocal support when Mr. Schwalb sued the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

“My 100 percent focus is on exiting the emergency,” the mayor said to reporters when asked about the lawsuit. “That’s where all of our energies are.”

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) says election officials have used the tool to check the information of more than 33 million voters — a striking portion of the American public, considering little information has been made public about the tool's accuracy or data security.

The latest update to the system, known as SAVE, took effect Aug. 15 and allows election officials to use just the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers — along with names and dates of birth — to check if the voters are U.S. citizens, or if they have died.

The upgrade makes the tool far more accessible, since it now aligns with the information most states collect or have access to for most voters. But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses USCIS, has not responded to questions about the system from members of Congress, and numerous election officials NPR spoke with expressed concern about what else the Trump administration could do with the data it acquires from states.

""There's still uncertainty about what is happening, what happens to the data that are shared with USCIS,"" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor who directs the MIT Election Data and Science Lab. ""I don't know if this means that the USCIS now has a depository of one-sixth of all [the country's] registered voters.""

In recent months, several Republican-led states have brokered new agreements with USCIS to use SAVE, or announced the results of SAVE reviews. Ohio election officials will begin removing from their rolls thousands of inactive voters that SAVE identified as deceased. And Louisiana's secretary of state announced last week that officials identified 79 likely noncitizens who had voted in at least one election since the 1980s, after running nearly all of the state's 2.9 million registered voters through SAVE.

DHS is encouraging officials in other states to upload data to the system — even going so far as to make millions of dollars of grant money contingent on them using it.

But USCIS did not respond to NPR's questions about what happens to the data states upload and who has access to it.

And officials in other GOP-led states have expressed caution about using the system.

Last month, North Carolina's Republican-controlled state election board did not take up an offer by USCIS to participate in a ""soft launch"" of the upgraded tool. Spokesperson Patrick Gannon told NPR in a statement that state officials are pursuing ""agreements to ensure that proper safeguards would be in place to protect and secure the data, if a decision is ultimately made to use the service.""

Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, a Republican, told NPR the upgraded SAVE seemed like a ""fantastic tool,"" but he still has questions before he can run his voter list through it to ensure it is authorized under state law.

""Where's that data going? And at the end of the day, is it stored? What are they going to do with it? Who has access? Is it shared?"" Watson told NPR last month. ""I don't want to do something that I don't necessarily have the ability to do without legislative authority. So we just want to be very clear on that before we move forward.""

SAVE concerns are compounded by other Trump moves on elections

The push for states to use the upgraded data system comes as the Trump administration is taking unprecedented steps to assert control over elections as well as collect and aggregate personal data on Americans — at times potentially risking the security of that data.

Numerous voting officials told NPR they felt the revamped SAVE tool could be useful for confirming citizenship status without encumbering voters, and many Democrats also acknowledged the efforts by Trump's USCIS to work in a bipartisan fashion.

But concerns about SAVE are compounded by other moves by President Trump's administration. Trump continues to make baseless claims about widespread noncitizen voting, has attempted to change voter registration rules to include proof-of-citizenship requirements, and has directed the Justice Department to prioritize prosecuting noncitizens who register or vote. DHS also recently elevated a person who spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election to a post on election integrity.

As part of the administration's stated aim to crack down on noncitizen voting, USCIS prioritized updating the data system known as Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, that state and federal agencies have for decades used to query DHS databases to determine if foreign-born individuals are eligible for various benefits.

The agency, working with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, made SAVE free to states and allowed bulk searches, as opposed to looking up one person at a time — changes that were celebrated by many voting officials.

""It's getting access to data that already exists and just making it so [election officials] can more easily compare things without making it hard for voters,"" said Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican who has begun testing out SAVE's upgraded capabilities. ""I'm trying to make it easier for voters while also doing these validations.""

In May, USCIS linked data from the Social Security Administration, allowing election officials for the first time to check the citizenship of many U.S.-born citizens with the voter's name, date of birth and nine-digit Social Security number. NPR was the first news outlet to report on the change.

The integration with Social Security Administration data also means SAVE can show if someone appears on that agency's Death Master File.

Since most states only collect the last four digits of Social Security numbers from voters, the latest upgrade swung open the door for many more states to use SAVE. USCIS says almost 80% of the 33 million voters validated via SAVE were run through the system since the Aug. 15 change.

An unprecedented push for voter data

In mid-July, California Sen. Alex Padilla and two other Democratic U.S. senators formally requested information on the updated SAVE system from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, including the accuracy rate of the SAVE program, what data USCIS stores and who has access, and whether the agency is following protocols spelled out in federal privacy laws.

The senators asked for answers by July 29 but have not heard back.

""In light of the president's threats to issue unconstitutional executive orders to interfere with state elections, DHS owes Congress and the public some basic transparency about what they are doing with state voter rolls,"" Padilla told NPR.

SAVE pings a number of data sources, as opposed to being a database in and of itself. But under USCIS policy, all queries are saved for 10 years for audit purposes, so if a state runs its whole voter list through the tool, that data will remain with DHS for a decade.

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, told NPR that such a system sounded like the beginnings of a national voter registration list that would raise privacy and security concerns.

""They said they're going to keep our data for 10 years,"" Bellows said. ""If [former Attorney General] Merrick Garland were asking for this or President Biden, I have to think that the red states would be calling for their heads.""

The agreements that states sign to use SAVE include a clause that grants DHS permission to use information from states ""for any purpose permitted by law, including, but not limited to, the prosecution of violations of Federal administrative or criminal law.""

At a White House meeting about SAVE in late July, USCIS officials tried to reassure state voting officials about sharing sensitive voter data, according to Connecticut Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas, who attended the meeting.

""They said many times like, 'Look, we know the states are in charge of elections. We don't want your data. We don't want your lists,' "" Thomas recalled.

But in recent weeks, the Department of Justice has been making controversial demands to numerous states to turn over such data, including in several instances voter rolls that include personal data like driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.

Thomas, a Democrat, said that when a Republican secretary of state pointed out the DOJ's voter data demands to USCIS officials, the officials responded that they worked for a separate agency.

""The worst thing you can get is a false positive""

USCIS hasn't publicized detailed evidence about the accuracy of the tool or shared what testing went into the program before it was released to states, though it asserts SAVE's accuracy has markedly improved with the recent upgrades.

But voting rights groups and some election officials are voicing concerns that eligible voters could face barriers to casting ballots or be improperly removed from the rolls if states over-rely on incomplete information from SAVE.

USCIS acknowledges that certain categories of people who acquired U.S. citizenship, such as some foreign-born children of U.S. citizens, cannot be verified by SAVE.

Furthermore, data matching in elections is notoriously difficult and there are questions about the completeness of the Social Security Administration's citizenship data USCIS is relying on.

Wesley Wilcox, a Republican elections supervisor in Marion County, Fla., signed an agreement this summer giving his county access to SAVE. But he said he plans to double check any data he gets from the system, since he's encountered multiple instances in which SSA data indicated a person was dead when they weren't.

""It's like any new process that you put into effect … we're going to do that legwork,"" Wilcox said. ""I want to be as accurate as humanly possible at all times.""

For a portion of foreign-born individuals, SAVE prompts user agencies to submit more information, such as a person's naturalization certificate number or alien registration number, for their case to be manually reviewed. USCIS told NPR that of the 33 million voters submitted to the upgraded SAVE so far, less than 1% have required that manual review. The agency did not respond to NPR's question about the results of the manual review, how many noncitizens on voter rolls have been identified to date or what portion of the results so far were inconclusive.

While USCIS' materials say election officials are not supposed to reject voter registrations or remove voters from the rolls if the SAVE system asks for more voter information, it is not yet clear if there are consequences if states skip those steps.

Last year, thousands of U.S. citizens in states including Alabama, Virginia and Texas were removed from the rolls or deactivated after election officials relied on imperfect data to identify suspected noncitizens.

Conservative election integrity advocates have broadly celebrated SAVE's development, but among some, there is also an acknowledgement that states need to be cautious when removing people from voter rolls.

""I am hopeful that a great deal of care and a great deal of contemplation is going into this process because the worst thing you can get is a false positive,"" said J. Christian Adams, president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation. ""The worst thing you could do, as some states have done in the past, is remove a citizen from the voter rolls as a noncitizen. That should not happen.""

In 2019, a court settlement required Adams to apologize to a group of Virginia voters his organization incorrectly claimed were noncitizens.

Louisiana's test case

The most in-depth data about how the updated SAVE is working came last week from Louisiana.

The state's Republican secretary of state, Nancy Landry, told reporters that by using SAVE, her office identified 390 people on the voter rolls who they believe are noncitizens. Seventy-nine of them were found to have voted. Landry said there was a review of each suspected noncitizen and her office worked with the FBI to investigate their citizenship status.

""They have been given notice we have reason to believe they are not a U.S. citizen,"" Landry said. ""They have the opportunity to come in and provide documentation that they are in fact a U.S. citizen.""

Anyone who does not respond or provide proof within 21 days is removed from the rolls, Landry said, and noncitizens who registered to vote — regardless of whether they were among the 79 who voted in recent decades — will be referred for criminal prosecution.

The number of suspected noncitizens Louisiana found to have voted amounts to less than 0.003% of the state's registered voters, a percentage that aligns with what many other reviews on the issue have found.

""The very small numbers suggest that the results are what we expected, and that they are not alarming,"" said Stewart of MIT.

He added that number might shrink further as some people may prove to be citizens.

Yet even as there are signs the SAVE program is generating helpful data, Stewart said it is troubling that USCIS is withholding answers to key questions, like what happens to the data that is uploaded or detailed breakdowns on SAVE results so far.

In Minnesota, state voting officials would need a change to state law to use SAVE for elections. But Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, said he won't push for such a change until he has more clarity on how it works.

""Certainly it's impressive what they've done in a short period of time,"" Simon said. ""[But] I'd want to see a lot more by way of testing and assurances about the accuracy before we would be a willing and enthusiastic participant.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1862x1047+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F5f%2F8d0f150b4ac29e3bb41c336d28f7%2Fgettyimages-2182415974.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 06:56:35.547531

That will not change the course of events that is to follow, however, because Gregorio Cordova Murrieta is to remain behind bars while he awaits a likely deportation.

U.S. District Court Judge Micah Smith sentenced Cordova, who pleaded guilty in August to illegal re-entry, to time served — the 76 days he has already spent at the Federal Detention Center on Elliott Street in Honolulu.

Smith said that all the factors he considered, from Cordova’s motivation for unlawfully crossing the border to his stellar conduct in the community, “overwhelmingly weigh in favor of time served.” The maximum sentence he could have faced was two years in prison, and a fine of as much as $250,000.

Cordova — who was not charged with any other crime and Smith noted has no past criminal record — was to be placed directly into the custody of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE.

On Tuesday, the judge spent several minutes reading aloud portions of letters submitted to the court in support of Cordova.

From a U.S. soldier grievously wounded in combat in Iraq whom Cordova helped to recover enough to play soccer again. From another wounded combat veteran who said Cordova had been “instrumental in my mental wellbeing.” From his fiancée’s children, who called him a “source of joy, companionship, and stability” for their mother and “an example of resilience.” From clients in his tile setting and countertop business who called his workmanship “first class” and described him as a “benefit to our economy who filled a need for honest and trustworthy workers.”

Letter after letter, Smith said, “showed that you have made a very significant impact on others who lived here.”

In the Aha Kaulike courtroom, or Place of Equity, the judge gave Cordova the opportunity to speak before being sentenced. He asked for forgiveness from Hawaiʻi’s governor, the judge and prosecutors for illegally entering the state and country.

He then turned to about a dozen family and friends. They were crying and so was he.

“I’d like to thank all my family,” he said through an interpreter, “and ask their forgiveness for putting them through this.”

Traced Through Transfers

Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, traced Cordova’s whereabouts through records of his money transfer transactions, according to the criminal complaint they filed in the case. Experts said it was the first time they were aware of those kinds of records being used to investigate cases related to solely immigration-related offenses.

They said the government’s access to the records most likely came through a database maintained by the nonprofit Transaction Record Analysis Center, or TRAC, to which companies such as Western Union and MoneyGram have submitted transaction data since at least 2014. It was first set up to help investigators track money laundering, drug trafficking and other such crimes.

TRAC was established following a 2010 settlement between the Arizona Attorney General’s Office and Western Union, which was required to send information about transfers over $500 — including details that identify the sender — to the nonprofit.

Immigration attorneys said Cordova’s ability to seek asylum or take any other measures to try to persuade authorities to allow him to stay in the country where he has lived for approximately 17 years, is extremely limited.

“He is going to be definitely handed to ICE to deport him almost immediately,” said Neribel Chardon, senior staff attorney at The Legal Clinic, a nonprofit that represents immigrants. “That is what’s going to happen.”

The only hitch, Chardon said, is if Cordova does not have a current passport or travel documents, in which case ICE would work with the Mexican government to obtain them before sending him back.

Cordova’s fiancée, Grace Perez Parra of ʻAiea, said that at this point he just wants to go see his parents and children, who live in a rural region of Puebla state. They were the ones he was helping support with proceeds from his work on Oʻahu.

She said Cordova, in their most recent telephone conversation, said: “Mama, I just want people to know I’m not a criminal.”

Parra said she is going to try and contact an immigration attorney to see whether Cordova could be allowed to return to the United States at some point.

“If I can, I’m going to try, but if not, then I’ll just go there,” she said. “It’s sad, you know, but I can’t do anything about it, right? You just got to go with the law.”

Having the illegal reentry conviction on his record is almost certainly “a permanent bar” to Cordova ever being granted legal permission to return, Chardon said.

According to court documents, Cordova, now 48, had been detained at the U.S.-Mexican border in 2004 and sent back to Mexico. Then, within the space of a few days in 2008, he was detained and sent back twice more.

Federal investigators who located him in Honolulu through details collected in the MoneyGram transactions staked out his house and used an anonymous source to confirm his identity. Shortly after dawn on June 26, they banged on his and Parra’s front door and arrested him.

Cordova originally pleaded not guilty to the charge of illegal reentry but changed his plea to guilty in August because, Parra said, he just wanted to see his family in Mexico again.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/02/03103523/230201-dc-Federal-Court-7214.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:56:40.707065
