She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.
Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.
“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver.
Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.","WASHINGTON — The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting TSA director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the TSA’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised TSA workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is funded in the United States.

They also asked McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Kennedy pressed McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting immigrants lacking permanent legal status, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Trump.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01212026_tsa-tzr_tzr_183402.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-22 01:56:55.642077

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in an email that it began on Tuesday what it’s calling “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier told Fox News that it had arrested nearly 50 people so far.

Those numbers have not been independently verified by Maine Morning Star nor community organizers because of Homeland Security’s otherwise silence on the matter and the inherent challenges with tracking people in the immigration system. Maine’s congressional delegation, the governor and local public officials have also not gotten responses from President Donald Trump’s administration about operations in Maine.

“We have no information,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Press Secretary Blake Kernen.

The community hotline tracking enforcement action in Maine began ringing continuously with reports of sightings on Tuesday, after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities announced last week that they were expecting a surge in ICE activity.

As organizers continue to crowdsource sightings and attempt to track down specifics, Project Relief Maine, Presente! Maine and No ICE for Maine are advising immigrants to shelter in place, especially in the Greater Portland area.

“Right now, it is unsafe to be outside, whether walking, driving, or waiting at bus stops,” the group posted on social media.

Sightings of federal agents in Maine were centered around Portland and Lewiston on Tuesday but on Wednesday expanded to Westbrook, South Portland, Biddeford, Scarborough, Waterville and Belfast, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, which runs the hotline.

By 12:30pm Wednesday, the hotline had received 522 calls, with the most being about federal agent sightings. At the end of the day yesterday, organizers had fielded 870 calls. For comparison, the hotline received 288 calls in the entire month of December, and 195 in November.

Gov. Janet Mills said she’s monitoring ICE activity, too. “If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said in a statement Wednesday evening. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Maine’s members of Congress have responded to the ICE operations in their state with varying support. While Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent U.S. Sen. Angus King offered clear condemnation, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said they’re supportive so long as it is a targeted operation focused on people who have engaged in criminal activity.

DHS Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News that the agency has 1,400 targets in Maine. In an email, DHS said they are “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” DHS only released information about four of the nearly 50 people reported to have been arrested Tuesday. Those the agency highlighted have convictions such as aggravated assault and operating under the influence of alcohol.

Maine organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive

Meanwhile, ICE detained an Angolan man at a routine check in on Tuesday at the Scarborough field office and his lawyer told the Bangor Daily News that he has no criminal record to justify his detention. A federal judge has ordered ICE to explain why the agency detained him.

As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held nationwide in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

DHS has not responded to requests from Maine Morning Star to confirm overall arrest numbers or the reasons for those arrests.

Community impacts

Maine is not seeing a singular method for arrests. There’s been apprehensions in parking lots and of people walking in downtown areas or pulled over on the highway. “There’s a reason we call it a dragnet,” Ruben said.

As a result, he said, “Some folks have been avoiding work. Some folks have been avoiding sending their kids to school and going to appointments altogether. Some folks have been creative in working with community networks that have been established to be able to get rides to go to doctors appointments.”

It’s not only immigrants who are altering their daily lives out of fear. Ruben, who is a person of color, said he’s had people accompany him to places like the grocery store so that he is not the only one in the car.

These changes in behavior ripple out to the entire community, such as businesses that rely on foot traffic and employers who may face staffing shortages for an unknown amount of time.

MaineHealth has reported higher than usual call-outs in some segments of its workforce.

Portland Public Schools is reporting a drop in attendance. Though the specific reasons for absences don’t show up in the data, Superintendent Ryan Scallon said Wednesday during a press conference overall attendance is down more than 5%, with some schools down as much as 15-20%.

Project Relief Maine has called for the district to close for the remainder of the week, in light of a mother who was detained after dropping her child off at school.

Local police cooperation

Echoing Maine Republicans, Hyde and DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine for restricting local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

Police are already not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws. A new state law, which won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns, aims to prevent local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, while still permitting police to investigate crimes and execute judicial warrants.

However, Maine State Police is already following the law. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck issued a directive last month that essentially implemented its underlying policies.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5436-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:56:51.501533

Then she heard rumors about the former private prison in Hudson being repurposed into a new ICE detention center.","HUDSON — Scores of demonstrators lined up outside a defunct private prison in northern Colorado on Wednesday then filled the Town Council’s chambers as they protested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plans to turn the facility into a detention center.

The prison in the small Weld County town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, was identified by ICE last year as a likely site of a new federal immigration detention facility.

“These are our neighbors,” Sydney Engel, who lives in nearby Fort Lupton, told the Hudson Town Council of the immigrants being apprehended by ICE. “It’s hard, but I won’t stand here and let my voice not be heard, especially living so close to this community.”

After nearly three hours of public comment from Coloradans across the state opposing an ICE facility coming to Hudson, Mayor Joe Hammock said,”Public comment is closed. Let’s move on.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has sued ICE multiple times, forcing the agency to turn over documents that revealed plans for additional detention centers in the state, including the use of the former Hudson Correctional Facility. The most recent document release, this month, confirms ICE is moving forward with plans to turn the former private prison into what the agency is calling the Big Horn Correctional Facility, said Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director.

The documents show ICE inked a six-month deal last year worth nearly $40 milion with contractor GEO Group for services at the Hudson prison. They also reference the Huerfano County Correctional Facility, another former private prison — in Walsenburg — that has been eyed by ICE for expanded detention capacity in Colorado.

However, most details, including operational timelines and contracts, were redacted or withheld, Macdonald said.

“They’re trying to hide what they’re doing,” Macdonald said in an interview with The Denver Post. “We know that ICE is trying to do this in secret. We’re seeing ICE act in renegade ways across the country. Shooting people, killing Renée Good in Minneapolis, shooting people in Portland. ICE has gone rogue. … We don’t know exactly how they’re proceeding with the expanded detention here, but we know they’re trying to do it in the dark without transparency, even though they’re using our public taxpayer dollars to do this. They should be accountable to us, the people.”

Representatives of Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the Hudson Correctional Facility, could not be reached for comment this week. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Post.

Weld County resident Jenifer Montes helped organize Wednesday afternoon’s protest at the prison site, which drew more than 100 people. Many of those demonstrators then attended the Town Council meeting, where they addressed the elected leaders to voice their opposition to the detention center.

An October protest outside the facility drew about 70 people.

On Wednesday, Jody Whitmore, a 67-year-old Frederick resident, held a sign outside the closed prison that said “No to concentration camps in Hudson.”

Whitmore attended the Hudson protest in October and returned Wednesday even angrier than before, she said, after witnessing the recent ICE activity in Minneapolis.

“It is disgusting,” Whitmore said. “It’s out of control. The federal government is out of control, and they want to ramp it up even more.”

Whitmore said the inhumane treatment of detained immigrants was why she likened the facilities to concentration camps. “Plus they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars,” she said

Gina McAfee, 71, said there were so many misconceptions about immigrants. Growing up in Greeley, she knew many immigrants and has worked in the immigrant rights space for about 10 years.

When McAfee learned about the Hudson ICE facility, she said, she felt compelled to protest.

“I was appalled,” she said. “The inhumane treatment currently going on at the Aurora detention center is just shocking. The fact they want to add another facility is just appalling.”

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, a progressive who is challenging U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in this summer’s Democratic primary, implored the crowd to keep speaking out.

“You all demonstrate the power of the Constitution of this country,” she said. “The Constitution protects us all. I don’t care what ICE has to say about it.”

‘The wishes of the people of Hudson’

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock did not respond to a request for comment. Before Wednesday’s meeting, The Post also reached out to the members of the Hudson Town Council — Matt Cole, Candace Nolf, Lisa Marie Buesgens, Zachary Reyes, Don Post and Rachel E. Thwaites — asking what they knew about ICE taking over the former prison and their thoughts on the situation.

Only Reyes responded, saying in an email that as a nonpartisan elected official, his personal viewpoint was “irrelevant.” He said Hudson has not been approached by the federal government or the GEO Group — which also runs ICE’s current 1,530-capacity detention center in Aurora — regarding permits or use of the facility.

“I will always act with the wishes of the people of Hudson,” Reyes wrote.

“The town has minimal say in what the owner of the property chooses to do with their property. The town can only enforce code requirements set forth with current ordinances in effect both locally and with the state. … We as the council know just as much about the rumors as you, the public, knows.”

Macdonald said a review of the town documents suggests Hudson officials believe ICE is moving ahead with the detention center, which could open within a year. Hudson has about 1,600 residents, and the new ICE facility effectively would double the town’s population with an expected capacity of about 1,300 detainees.

“That doesn’t even include workers, so the demand for water will go through the roof, and we know from their planning documents they’re concerned about how they’re going to manage that and what that will mean for existing water uses in Hudson,” Macdonald said.

The documents turned over to the ACLU also revealed:

ICE last year issued a contract to the GEO Group for more than $39 million for six months of services, between April and October, at the Hudson facility.

ICE issued another contract for the GEO Group dated Dec. 1 for the Hudson facility but redacted the terms and pricing.

ICE redacted more than 100 pages of documents from late August that appeared to be in justification of why the agency should award a sole contract to the GEO Group for the Hudson facility without full and open competition.

A contract for the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center, valued at less than $100,000, was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security for approval in August. No details about whether the proposal was approved could be located. Documents previously obtained by The Washington Post indicated ICE planned to add 28 beds to the existing Southern Ute detention center in Ignacio.

Another potential detention site, the former Huerfano County Correctional Facility in Walsenburg, was declared “funded,” but no additional details about the facility could be found in the documents.

Macdonald said the addition of any ICE detention centers in Colorado would be “a travesty.”

“They’re housing people who have in large measure never been accused or convicted of any crimes whatsoever,” Macdonald said. “They are people who have come to this country for a better life, and the way we treat them reflects on the values we have as a society. When we mistreat immigrants who are in civil detention, that’s a sign of how our government is treating all of us, so people should care when our government abuses the civil rights of anyone in our community.”

‘Nobody should have to live in fear’

Before this summer, Montes wasn’t an activist, but increasing ICE activity lit a fire beneath her. Now, the 34-year-old is organizing and leading protests against the proposed ICE facility that could open in her county.

“I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history,” Montes said. “I don’t want to look back and say all this happened before my eyes and I just stayed silent just because I was scared of some white guy.”

Montes’ parents came to the United States illegally from Mexico but now have legal status. Her family moved to Colorado in 2007, a year after one of the largest immigration raids in U.S. history played out at a Greeley meatpacking plant.

“We knew about it, and I have had family that worked there. And it’s something you always think about,” Montes said.

When ICE activity ramped up across the nation and in Colorado last year under the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations, Montes said she was too scared to speak up.

Then she heard rumors about the former private prison in Hudson being repurposed into a new ICE detention center.

“That’s way too close for comfort,” Montes said. “I wanted to be more involved and help the community also be prepared instead of just living in fear because nobody should have to live in fear.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GRE-L-HudsonICEProtest0121-0531x.jpg?w=1024&h=701,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:41.175303

Geoff Bennett: Kaohly Her, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, thanks again for your time this evening.","Geoff Bennett:

The Trump administration is ramping up its aggressive approach to immigration as it begins its second year.

The Associated Press reported today that an internal memo shows some new federal immigration officers have been trained to forcibly enter homes without a judge's warrant, a sharp reversal of guidance that protected constitutional limits.

That comes amid news that ICE's latest surge has targeted the state of Maine. At least 50 people were arrested there earlier this week. Some top local officials have condemned ICE's aggressive approach, including Portland Mayor Mark Dion during a news conference today.

Mark Dion, Mayor of Portland, Maine: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. What we have been concerned with as a council is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.

Geoff Bennett:

In Minnesota, there's been no letup in ICE's surge there now in its third week. Today, a federal appeals court put a hold on a lower court's order that had restrained federal immigration agents' use of force against peaceful protesters.

State and local officials are continuing to push back against the federal presence in the Twin Cities. And more details are coming to light about a naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family, who was arrested and detained by ICE in an incident that went viral.

Chongly Scott Thao, a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota, was later released and spoke recently about the ordeal after he was pulled from his home out through the snow.

Chongly Scott Thao, Detained By ICE:

So I just said, OK, let's open the door, see what they want. And then, suddenly, there's guns pointed at us. I was like, whoa. Then, suddenly, they just handcuffed me. They didn't ask for my I.D. or anything until after they handcuffed me.

Geoff Bennett:

And we are joined now by Kaohly Her, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota.

Thank you for being with us.

Give us the latest picture of what's happening right now on the ground in your city with federal immigration enforcement. And is there any coordination between ICE and local law enforcement?

Kaohly Her, Mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota: So there is no coordination between ICE and local law enforcement. We are not informed when they go out on their assignments or who they're targeting. We do not get that kind of information.

And I think that that is what is causing the environment on the ground right now. People are afraid. They are frustrated. They are angry. But, I mean, there's also a lot of hope that we see on the ground as well with the love and the care and the kindness that people are showing each other. And so I feel hopeful about what can be the outcome, even if it feels like there's despair all around us right now.

Geoff Bennett:

The police chief of the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Park said that off-duty police officers of color had been targeted by ICE, at least on one occasion with guns drawn.

Are St. Paul officers seeing that kind of activity?

Kaohly Her:

We are seeing accounts of off-duty officers being stopped by ICE. This is not an isolated incident of in the Brooklyn Park area. We have heard accounts across the state of law enforcement being stopped by ICE.

Geoff Bennett:

I also want to ask you about this incident in St. Paul where protesters disrupted a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE official.

At this moment, when tensions are already high, do you believe entering a house of worship during a service is an acceptable form of protest or does that cross a line?

Kaohly Her:

You know, there is an active investigation into that situation. I wouldn't -- police did arrive on the scene, but by the time they got there, the individuals who disrupted the service were already gone.

So I can't expand too much on really that particular situation, but I will say that, for me personally, I am somebody who is a person of faith. I'm a Christian. I think that places of worship are sacred spaces. But I have said this before, is that, if our federal government and our friends from the other side of the aisle want us to respect sacred spaces, which I believe are churches, a place of worship is a sacred space, that means that we have to also respect other spaces, such as hospitals, places of which people are needed to get exams or needed to be treated because of the hands of ICE have been injured.

That means that schools, where children are present, should be off-limits. And so I think that it is really important that if there's going to be call for respecting sacred spaces, then our federal government and the agents of the federal government should be respecting those sacred spaces as well. That is the only way that we're going to bring calm and order back to our city is if everyone on both sides of the spectrum agree that they're going to respect sacred spaces.

Geoff Bennett:

You are among a number of Democratic state and local officials to receive a Justice Department subpoena tied to an investigation into alleged disruption of ICE operations.

What's your reaction to being subpoenaed and how will your office respond?

Kaohly Her:

Yes, I mean, I wasn't surprised by it.

Our president has stated very clearly that he -- that there's retribution to be paid by states and municipalities that do not agree with him. And so -- but we remain committed to protecting our residents, our neighbors and our communities. It doesn't change the process or our actions moving forward.

But, yes, I wasn't surprised by it.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you intend to respond?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, we are having our legal team look at it right now. I mean, we will -- we are law-abiding citizens. We will comply with this subpoena.

But it doesn't mean that it's lawful what has been done and what we have been served with. But we will comply and we will work with our legal team to figure out the best steps forward.

Geoff Bennett:

What do you want people to know about what's happening in your city right now and how the folks you represent are responding?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, I think it's important for people to remember that they should not just believe in the rhetoric from their sides of the party, that the -- what I'm hearing out there is, if people would just comply with the law, that if they would just not resist, that if they were here legally, that they have nothing to worry about, that they shouldn't be scared.

And that is just not true. I mean, ICE has made it very clear, the federal government, HSI, has made it really clear that anybody in the path of anything that they're -- any task that they're executing on or any mission that they're executing on in that, they are fair game. And so we're allowing people to target based on the way someone looks and the way that they sound.

And now we have incident after incident after incident of American citizens being detained and being injured at the hands of ICE, people with no criminal record at all. We are hearing more of those cases than actual situations where somebody had a criminal record or is a danger to our communities, that we are hearing less of those stories and more of just everyday Americans being targeted.

We should not listen to the rhetoric of just our own sides of the party and hear the real stories of individuals who have been impacted. And I want people to know that this administration can punish our city and can punish our state, but they will never break our spirit, and that we will show and continue to love each other and create networks to support each other and that we will continue to show kindness to those who are the most hurt by what this federal government is doing.

We will continue to be Minnesotans.

Geoff Bennett:

Kaohly Her, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, thanks again for your time this evening.

The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.
An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant.
A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.
The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.","A whistle-blower group on Wednesday said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials drafted guidance saying that deportation officers are allowed to enter homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant.

The claim was based on information provided by two government officials, said the group, called Whistleblower Aid. The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.

An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant. It is typically drawn up after an immigration judge has ordered someone deported, and serves as the basis to arrest them. A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.

Whistleblower Aid said the guidance violates the constitutional protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

“D.H.S.’s new policy to permit arrests in an alien’s residence, without a judicial warrant or consent, is a complete break from the law and undercuts the Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects,” Whistleblower Aid said in a statement. “As far as our clients understand, D.H.S. has failed to articulate any change in the law to allow for a policy reversal of this magnitude.”

The Times has not independently verified the memo or spoken to the whistle-blowers involved, who are described as two U.S. government officials. The whistle-blowers’ claim was reported earlier by The Associated Press.

One Homeland Security Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had not seen the memo but said their understanding was that the idea was piloted in one or two locations earlier this year.

The whistle-blower group said that the memo was not widely distributed within ICE. Rather, some ICE officials were provided an opportunity to read the memo in the presence of a supervisor and give it back. One of the whistle-blowers, according to the group, said that agents were entering homes without judicial warrants in Texas, and that the practice was carried out there because of the conservative judges in the area.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings and demanded an explanation from the Homeland Security Department’s leader, Kristi Noem.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement. “It is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time.”

Department of Homeland Security officials did not contest the specific allegations made by the whistle-blower group.

“Every illegal alien who D.H.S. serves administrative warrants/I-205s,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman, has had “full due process” and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

“The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,” she added. “For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.”

ICE officers historically have relied on people voluntarily opening the doors of their homes to make arrests, or by tracking down targets in public spaces. The inability to enter homes has long stymied officers, in part because rights advocates advise immigrants not to open their doors when immigration officials arrive.

A 2025 Homeland Security training manual indicated that the agency itself agreed that entering homes without a judicial warrant was prohibited.

“Entering a home to arrest a person without a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement is typically a violation of the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether the officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect,” the manual reads.

The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.

“Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence,” the memo reads, “the D.H.S. Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo adds that officers and agents must knock and announce themselves first but says that if an immigrant does not respond, they can use a “reasonable amount” of force to enter the home.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/21dc-ice-warrant/13nat-minneapolis-protests-01-jlqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:45.580494

Ahmed said that she was in the area when she believes ICE were targeting two men she did not know, only for agents to shove her to the floor. She said that one of them called her a racial slur before putting her into a vehicle, where she said she met another woman who was detained.

""We were holding each other tight. I'll never forget the fear that we both felt in our hearts that day,"" Ahmed said, ""they pushed me hard, they used a lot of violence.""

Ahmed spent the next two days detained, only to be released without any charges. The 23-year-old was born in the United States and WCCO found no evidence of a criminal record.

Her story is one of many reported instances where ICE has detained an American citizen without charging them since Operation Metro Surge began in December. MN Ice Witness, a website driven by independent citizens, is recording media reports that detail these detainments. According to their efforts and WCCO's own review, ICE has detained at least 12 Americans, at times violently. DFL Representative Mohamud Noor shared video which he said shows ICE pulling an American man from his car in St. Cloud on Wednesday.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino did not answer a question about the number of Americans ICE has detained. The agency provides no public data regarding these arrests, with many of those involved accusing the agency of profiling them. WCCO has asked multiple times for data related to American detainments, questions the agency is choosing to ignore.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today in a landmark legal battle centered on President Trump's efforts to shape the Federal Reserve in his image.

Our justice correspondent Ali Rogin has more on the case that could threaten the independence of the nation's Central Bank -- Ali.

Ali Rogin:

Geoff, you may recall it was a key moment in the president's standoff with the Federal Reserve. Back in August, President Trump posted on his social media platform that he was firing one of the Central Bank's governors, Lisa Cook, alleging she'd committed mortgage fraud.

But Cook, who was appointed by President Biden, sued Trump to block her removal, claiming her firing was illegal, and lower courts have blocked her dismissal. A majority of the justices had tough questions today for Solicitor General John Sauer, expressing skepticism about the rushed nature of the case and Cook's lack of recourse.

Samuel Alito, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody, by the executive branch, by the district court, by the D.C. Circuit, in such a hurried manner?

Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Was Ms. Cook given the opportunity in some sort of formal proceeding to contest that evidence or explain it?

D. John Sauer, U.S. Solicitor General:

Not a formal proceeding. She was given an opportunity in public because she was notified.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

In the world?

D. John Sauer:

Yes.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Like, she was supposed to post about it, and that was the opportunity to be heard?

Ali Rogin:

The case comes as the Trump administration has moved to exert greater control over the Federal Reserve. This month, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about a building project.

For analysis on today's argument, we're joined now by ""News Hour"" Supreme Court analyst and SCOTUSblog co-founder Amy Howe and David Wessel, director at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings institute.

Thank you so much, both of you for being here.

Amy, this case has massive implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve. What were the key questions that were being looked at today and what are your major takeaways?

Amy Howe:

So the key questions -- I mean, as a really technical matter, the questions before the justices was simply whether to leave in place an order by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that leaves Lisa Cook in office.

This case came to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. The Trump administration was seeking permission to fire Cook and asking the justices to put this order by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb on hold. And after nearly two hours of oral arguments today, the justices seemed inclined to leave Cook in office, to turn down the Trump administration's request to pause Cobb's order.

The real question is how they are going to do it. Are they going to just send the case back to the lower courts and let the litigation play out there? Or are they going to try to resolve some of the thorny issues that are in play, things like what does it mean for the president to fire someone for cause? Can courts review a president's determination that he has fired a governor of the Federal Board -- Federal Reserve Board for cause?

What kind of process is someone entitled to before she can be fired? And the justices really sort of weren't sure. Several of them seemed inclined to send the case back to the lower courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, on the other hand, seemed to suggest that the court maybe should go ahead and decide the case right now.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, it was interesting, David. Some of the conservative justices seemed to engage in some of those thorny questions that Amy was talking about.

Justice Kavanaugh raised concerns about what this attempted dismissal code means for the Fed's independence. He said that, if the president alone can determine whether somebody can be removed for cause and what that cause is, that that could -- quote -- ""weaken, if not shatter the independence of the Fed.""

Why is the independence of this body so important?

David Wessel, Brookings Institution:

So the argument is that politicians, if they set interest rates, will tend to sit them too low in order to get more growth now and at the cost of more inflation later.

And so the U.S. and other major capitalist democracies have decided it would be better to have an independent Central Bank that is insulated from that political pressure. The Fed has a mandate set by Congress, maximum employment and price stability. And Congress has said, you guys decide what's the best interest rate to achieve that goal.

Ali Rogin:

And we have heard from a number of bankers, economists had written briefs in favor of Lisa Cook today, saying why this would be such a bad idea.

Why is there so much concern now over the firing for cause of just this one person on the Board of Governors?

David Wessel:

If President Trump gets his way, he will be able to fire any Fed governor for anything he deems is cause. The administration argues that the courts can't even review that.

So, for instance, his attacks on Jay Powell, the Fed chair, over the building, the Fed's handling of the building, not its finest hour, by the way, could become perhaps a reason to fire him for cause. And if the president can get rid of all seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, he would have control.

In fact, one of the questions that lawyers were asked today was, well, if we let Trump do this, will his successor just do the same and get rid of all the Trump appointees?

Ali Rogin:

The Supreme Court, Amy, has had to weigh in on a number of these sort of existential questions this term. They have looked at different ways the president has tried to exert control. They heard a case just this month, last month, about Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump had dismissed.

How is the court grappling with Trump's efforts to reshape the federal government in this major way?

Amy Howe:

So up until the case of Lisa Cook, the Supreme Court has green-lit Trump's efforts to remove the heads of independent multimember agencies. And so most of that has happened on the court's emergency docket.

The Supreme Court has given the OK to the Trump administration to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, even though there are similar statutes that only allow the president to remove officials at those agencies for cause.

And then the Supreme Court heard oral arguments, as you said, in December, in the case of Rebecca Slaughter, a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump fired. And they seemed inclined to rule in favor of the Trump administration.

So in one of the orders on the emergency docket, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that members of the NLRB and the MSPB had made that said, if you are allowed to -- if Trump is allowed to fire us, what happens to the Fed? Because the statutes are similar.

And the Supreme Court in that case said, essentially, the Fed is special, and don't worry about the Fed. And so the case of Lisa Cook today suggests that the Supreme Court does regard the Fed as special.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, we are now worrying about the Fed.

David, last question to you.

Today's arguments, of course, were part of a longstanding -- just the latest in the longstanding effort by President Trump to take on the Fed. We mentioned the investigation into Jerome Powell. It's hard not to look at these things all in concert together. Are they all of a piece, or should we be looking at them discretely?

David Wessel:

They are definitely all of a piece.

I mean, as Amy pointed out, the court is a hard time here to explain why the Fed is special. I can argue why the Fed is special, but I don't have to make a legal argument. Jerome Powell was in the courtroom today, and I think that was a reminder to the justices that this is not about one Fed governor who may or may not have made a mistake or cheated on her mortgage application.

This is about the very concept that people are appointed to the Federal Reserve Board for terms of up to 14 years, and they can only be removed for cause, and most of the justices seem to think that whatever she did on her mortgages wouldn't qualify.

Ali Rogin:

Amy Howe with SCOTUSblog, David Wessel of the Brookings Institution, thank you both so much.

David Wessel:

You're welcome.

Amy Howe:

The shooting of Ms. Good, an unarmed mother of three, has led to sustained protests against federal agents in Minneapolis.
Instead, the department has signaled that it intends to scrutinize possible connections between Ms. Good and her partner, Becca Good, and left-wing protesters in Minnesota.
Ten federal prosecutors from Michigan have been assigned to work in Minnesota for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter.
But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.","Federal prosecutors issued subpoenas on Tuesday to at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota, ramping up the Justice Department’s investigation into their response to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The subpoenas sought documents from Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state. Similar subpoenas sought information from Keith Ellison, the state attorney general, and from Hennepin County, where Mary Moriarty, the county attorney, has said she has jurisdiction to investigate the fatal shooting this month of a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, by a federal immigration agent.

The subpoenas, all of which were formally served on the officials’ offices, represent a significant expansion of the inquiry into Minnesota leaders that was disclosed late Friday. The investigation was initially said to have focused on Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz, who have both criticized the crackdown. But it now appears that prosecutors will also scrutinize other public officials.

While the subpoenas did not cite a specific criminal statute, the inquiry as a whole was said to center on whether elected officials in Minnesota had conspired to impede the thousands of federal agents who have been in the state since last month looking for undocumented immigrants. But the investigation is likely to run up against stiff pushback for examining political speech and conduct that is traditionally protected by the First Amendment.

The shooting of Ms. Good, an unarmed mother of three, has led to sustained protests against federal agents in Minneapolis. In the immediate aftermath of Ms. Good’s death, Mr. Frey used an expletive to demand that agents leave the city. Mr. Walz has also sharply criticized the agents’ conduct, asking residents to monitor their efforts.

Justice Department leaders, in turn, have vowed to arrest anyone impeding the agents’ mission. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, recently accused Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz of “encouraging violence against law enforcement” and referred to their actions as “terrorism.” But there is no evidence that either man has incited violence — let alone engaged in acts of terrorism.

The investigation into the elected Democrats comes as the Justice Department has all but announced that it will not bring charges against Jonathan Ross, the agent who killed Ms. Good. Instead, the department has signaled that it intends to scrutinize possible connections between Ms. Good and her partner, Becca Good, and left-wing protesters in Minnesota.

That decision led to the resignation last week of six prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis. Among those who quit was Joseph H. Thompson, the office’s second in command, who oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that President Trump and his allies have repeatedly used to criticize Democratic leaders in the state.

Federal investigators have refused to cooperate with state and local officials like Mr. Ellison and Ms. Moriarty, who have the power to open their own inquiries into Ms. Good’s killing. But the additional subpoenas could further complicate those efforts.

In recent days, the Trump administration has started enlisting prosecutors and agents from other states to travel to Minnesota to assist in pursuing criminal cases against protesters they claim have impeded the activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Over the weekend, Attorney General Pam Bondi pressed U.S. attorneys in Midwestern states to provide personnel.

Ten federal prosecutors from Michigan have been assigned to work in Minnesota for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter. Additional prosecutors are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

Administration officials have repeatedly said that ICE agents have been under sustained assault from protesters. But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.

The Justice Department needs additional personnel in part because so many senior prosecutors left the Minneapolis office rather than follow orders from the department’s leaders to conduct a criminal investigation into Ms. Good. The office already faced a significant staff shortage because many prosecutors had left last year as the Trump administration offered buyouts and encouraged prosecutors to quit.

To try to address the shortage, Justice Department leaders plan to draw staff from six states: Michigan, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, according to people familiar with the matter and internal department communications.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/dc-minnesota-tzqh/dc-minnesota-tzqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:56:54.564217

However, Norristown police chief Michael Trail acknowledged that officers do have contact with ICE agents.
According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.","A nationwide immigration crackdown has cast waves of fear, frustration and uncertainty throughout the Montgomery County seat.

More than 70 people gathered Tuesday evening for a vigil outside Norristown Municipal Hall to call attention to a surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the community.

“This community is under siege by ICE,” said Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer with Montco Community Watch. “What people are seeing in Minnesota is not new — the violence, the kidnapping, the disrespect for due process is happening right here in our towns and in Norristown.”

The candlelight gathering coincided with a municipal council meeting. Organizers used the public comment section to demand transparency from the Norristown Police Department regarding its relationship with ICE.

“We see them all the time together,” said Denisse Agurto, executive director of Unides Para Servir Norristown.

Agurto began her public comment with a mask on — a mask she said ICE officers often wear when patrolling along Marshall Street.

Norristown does not honor ICE detainer requests unless accompanied by a “validly executed judicial warrant.” The municipality also discourages government departments, including the police, from sharing information with the federal agency.

However, Norristown police chief Michael Trail acknowledged that officers do have contact with ICE agents. Trail told WHYY News that his department is “trying to balance” its responsibilities, but he said his officers are not assisting ICE.

“When you’re seeing a Norristown police officer in the proximity of an ICE agent, it’s natural assume that we’re assisting, but lot of times we are called there for other ancillary reasons or quite frankly, I would like our officers there because I want our officers to know and I want federal law enforcement to know that we’re out here protecting our community,” Trail said.

Trail met with Agurto shortly after her public comment, and the two shared a dialogue outside of the council’s chambers.

Despite the blistering cold Tuesday night, the vigil drew members from various communities in and around Norristown.

“We are reminded that whereas it is not a sin or moral failing to not have worldly paperwork, it is a sin and moral failing to turn away our neighbor,” said Rev. Leslie Mamas, of Olivet-Schwenkfelder United Church of Christ in East Norriton.

According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.

“We’ve crossed into the territory where ICE has become the law enforcement arm of a fascist regime,” Vincent said. “And it’s time to start saying that out loud. It’s time to say that our public officials, our towns cannot work with this organization. It’s not acceptable, it’s not OK, and it’s about defending the Constitution.”

The Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has only heightened tensions.

“We were always saying that something is going to happen — like somebody’s going to be killed,” Agurto said. “And now we are seeing this.”

The Department of Justice is not actively investigating the circumstances of Good’s death. Instead, the federal government has pushed prosecutors to look into Good’s widow, sparking resignations among some prosecutors. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would open the door for the deployment of active-duty troops.

“I’ve been a registered Republican my whole adult life and what’s happening in this country is making me — I don’t even recognize it anymore,” said vigil attendee Fiona Palladino, of King of Prussia.

Palladino said she’s a nurse who works with a 911 agency. She reiterated testimony from some of the public speakers that people are reluctant to call 911 for medical attention.

“They’re afraid, and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to reassure people, ‘We’re not the cops. You’re safe with us. We’re not the cops,’” she said. “But that right there is going to discourage people from getting help, and there are going to be real injuries. There are going to be real deaths due to this kind of thing.”

Palladino called on people to “step up and be out here.” Lori Warren, of West Norriton, said she came out to support her fellow neighbors.

“I’m a white middle-aged woman, so I’m privileged, and I’m using my privilege to come out and to let our neighbors know that they’re not alone and that we want our police to protect them just like they would protect us,” Warren said.

Vincent said it’s a “pivotal moment” for police. She wondered aloud if ICE descends en masse on the Philadelphia area as it has in Minneapolis, how would local law enforcement respond?

“Are the police going to protect them?” she asked. “Are the police going to stop them?”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/norristown-ice-vigil-KC-012126-09.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:54.765203

Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).
230,000 Interior Removals With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.","A recent article in the New York Times is headlined “How Many People Has Trump Deported So Far?” The stats offered by the “Gray Lady” look fairly accurate, but the story it’s attempting to tell — that Trump II is lagging prior administrations in “deporting” removable aliens from the United States — is suspect. That’s largely because of the facts the “newspaper of record” conveniently ignores — particularly about the correlation between “at large” arrests and “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

“What Is a Deportation?”

The Times asks the question “What is a deportation?”, which is fundamental to its analysis.

But then the article fails to answer that critical question, asserting: “Counting deportations is not as straightforward as it seems because there is not a specific legal definition.” Perhaps an outlet that holds itself in high esteem should check its own archives (colloquially the Times’ “morgue”).

The reason there’s no “specific legal definition” for “deportations” is because Congress formally retired it nearly 30 years ago (for legal reasons), swapping out both that term — which referred to the expatriation of aliens who had entered the United States — and “exclusions” (which referred to aliens stopped and turned around at the ports and borders) for “removals”.

“Removal” refers to the expulsion of aliens ordered removed by DHS under the “expedited removal” process in section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as well as those ordered removed by immigration judges at the end of administrative “removal proceedings” process under section 240 of the INA.

To be fair, most — expert and casual observer alike — continue to use “deportations” to refer to removals, because it’s a term we all understand.

Vestiges of that retired term continue to haunt the INA, including when Congress delineated the grounds of removability for aliens who have been “admitted” to the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA) in section 237 of the act, captioned “Deportable aliens”.

The real goal the Times is attempting to achieve is valid, which is measuring the number of removable aliens who have left the United States since Donald Trump returned, including: aliens removed under final removal orders, aliens turned around at the borders and the ports, crewmen with denied requests to land, and otherwise removable aliens who left on their own accord (so-called “self-deportations”).

The newspaper’s effort is complicated by the fact that various administrations have fudged their “deportation” totals for decades by lumping in “turn-arounds” at the borders and the ports (as well as crewmen) with more formal removals.

The Obama administration was likely the most egregious offender in that regard, which is why you should take characterizations of the 44th president as the “deporter in chief” with a grain of salt.

It was a title he gleefully accepted in a failed gambit to pass the amnesty he desperately desired, but at this point it’s so baked into the analysis it’s unfair to judge his successors by any other metric.

By the way, measured in this manner, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush would share the “deporter in chief” title for the 1.864 million removals and returns they oversaw in FY 2000, with Reagan a close finisher at 1.61 million in 1986. In contrast, Obama broke 850,000 just once, in FY 2010.

The Demographic Shift in Illegal Immigration

For most of his administration, Obama (and his predecessors) had a “deportation” advantage Biden and Trump didn’t: Prior to FY 2011, illegal migrants at the Southwest border were almost exclusively single adults — mostly male — from Mexico, and even up to FY 2014, the majority were.

When Border Patrol agents apprehend a single adult from Mexico at the Southwest border, they can generally process the alien and turn him back to Mexico in about eight hours. That’s a “deportation” under that continuing Obama-era calculus.

The problem is that about a quarter of those FY 2011 illegal migrants were “recidivists”, meaning they came back after they were turned around, and when they were apprehended again and returned once more, officially counted as a second deportation.

Given that the Southwest border recidivism rate was 30 percent or higher between FY 2005 (when DHS first attempted to capture that statistic) and FY 2009, you can understand how specious Obama’s record on “deportations” was.

From FY 2014 until Trump II, however, most illegal entrants weren’t Mexican nationals, and importantly at certain times weren’t single adults (let alone males), either.

In FY 2019, the high point for illegal immigration under Trump I, just 19.5 percent of the 851,500-plus Southwest border apprehensions involved Mexican nationals, and more than 64.5 percent involved either adult migrants entering illegally with children in “family units” (“FMUs”, 55.6 percent) or “unaccompanied alien children” (“UACs”, 8.9 percent) travelling alone.

Thanks to a combination of poorly reasoned court decisions and equally poorly considered laws, DHS had to release nearly all of those FMUs and UACs, and because most of the single adults were “other than Mexican” (OTMs), they couldn’t be quickly turned around, either.

Trump I responded to that OTM/FMU surge with the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico”, under which a small number of OTM FMUs and single adults were sent back across the border to await their asylum hearings, but that process didn’t produce “deportations” even under the lax Obama-era standards.

The good news for Trump II is that those pre-FY 2014 border demographics have returned, for now.

Of the 79,507 illegal migrants apprehended at the Southwest border between last February (the first full month of Trump II) and December, two-thirds (67 percent or 53,395) were Mexican nationals, 86 percent of whom were single adults.

Because, again, those Mexican nationals can be quickly returned, that flow boosts total “deportations” under the lax Obama-era “deportation” definition the Times prefers, but because Southwest border illegal entries have fallen by more than 90 percent under Trump II, it also detracts from the total.

The differences in border apprehension and return totals between the current administration and the last one are why the Times argues “the total number of deportations since Mr. Trump took office [is] 540,000 — fewer than in the last two years of the Biden administration, when border crossings were at record highs”, but the higher Biden numbers signal the weakness of his policies, not their strength.

More aliens attempted to enter illegally under Biden because they assumed (usually correctly) that they’d be able to remain. Fewer are coming now because they understand they likely won’t be allowed to stay, and lower attempted entries means more border security, or as Congress termed it, “operational control”.

“Interior Removals”

As I’ve explained in the past, the key metric for measuring the effectiveness of immigration enforcement efforts is ICE “deportations” of aliens within the United States (as opposed to at the border), formally known as “interior removals” (a term of art, even if it’s news to the Times). Here’s why that’s true.

Border enforcement is “reactive” because generally, DHS can’t control the number of migrants who come to the border illegally.

Biden was the exception to that rule, because by releasing nearly all (88.5 percent) of the illegal entrants who arrived at the borders and the ports, his administration spurred the largest illicit migrant surge in U.S. history, while (ironically) also boosting “deportations” of the rest under the Times’ flawed reasoning.

Interior enforcement, on the other hand, is proactive: DHS must identify, arrest, detain, and prosecute those aliens before it removes them.

Under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in FY 2009, ICE set its most recent record for interior removals, nearly 238,000 that fiscal year. Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).

That decline occurred when the Obama administration added a new wrinkle to interior removals, focusing its interior enforcement efforts at first (in March 2011) to a degree and then (in November 2014) almost exclusively on criminal aliens living in the United States.

That Obama “criminal alien” standard has come to define the purpose of “deportations” in the collective minds of many Americans and most in the media, which is why you see so many hit pieces now that deride ICE under Trump II for arresting “non-criminal” aliens in the interior.

“Deportation Is Crucial”

Trump supporters and many on the right usually respond to such attacks by noting most of those aliens are “criminals” because it’s a crime to enter the United States illegally (under section 275 of the INA) or highlighting the crimes “otherwise law-abiding aliens” must commit to remain here, like identity theft.

Those points are true and indisputable, but they miss three more important points.

First, it’s impossible to secure the border against a surge in illegal migrants, drugs, and other contraband if would-be migrants believe that if they can enter illegally and avoid the cops once they are here, they will be inoculated against “deportation”.

Second, the cognate to the (legitimate) focus on the due process rights of aliens in removal proceedings is the duty of the United States to remove aliens who have been accorded that due process and ordered removed.

Simply put, aliens have some level of protection under the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, but so do Americans in the removal process, which is why ICE represents their interests in immigration courts.

Third, as Barbara Jordan explained:

Deportation is crucial. Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave. The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.

If the lead-up to the November 2024 elections demonstrated anything, it’s that Americans’ support for even legal immigration inevitably declines when they realize our immigration system lacks credibility and fails to serve our “national interest”.

Restoring credibility to our immigration system requires removals, regardless of whether those aliens are criminals or not. Obama may have minimized non-criminal removals, but there’s no reason ICE must continue to play that game.

230,000 Interior Removals

With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.

Assuming that interior removal statistic is correct, the agency has fallen just slightly short of that (most recent) FY 2009 record of almost 238,000 interior removals, but then again: (1) ICE is far outperforming interior removals during the Biden years; and (2) is doing so in a much more challenging environment.

The Times concedes the first point but let me explain the second.

The Center defines “sanctuary jurisdictions” as:

cities, counties, and states [with] laws, ordinances, regulations, resolutions, policies, or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE — either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers, imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance, denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens, or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers.

As I explained to Congress last May, while some jurisdictions implemented sanctuary policies decades ago, the movement really took off in response to DHS’s mid-2010s “Secure Communities” program. Basically, state and local support for ICE enforcement took a nosedive around 2014.

Which brings me to the following excerpt from the Times’ article:

In the past, ICE made most of its arrests in partnership with local jails and prisons, quietly taking into custody immigrants who had already been arrested by another law enforcement agency.

. . .

Arrests at jails and prisons went up over the past year, but the increase was far exceeded by the growth in what ICE calls “at-large” arrests, the apprehensions of immigrants on the streets, in courthouses, and at homes and businesses. These quadrupled to about 150,000 and made up a majority of immigration arrests in 32 states and Washington, D.C.

They were most common in states like California, Illinois and New York, where local governments have passed laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody.

The Times doesn’t use the word “sanctuary”, but “laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody” are the definition of such policies. Its omission of the term was deliberate.

In any event, that article includes a map of the states in which ICE has made “at-large” arrests under Trump II, concentrated almost exclusively in the Northeast (including New York and Massachusetts), the Northwest (Washington and Oregon), Illinois, and (curiously) Alaska.

Except for Georgia, at-large arrests are significantly lower south of Virginia and (aside from Oklahoma) in the Plains states and in the Southwest.

That at-large arrest map correlates with the Center’s sanctuary jurisdiction map, which explains why clashes between protestors and ICE officers are almost exclusively limited to a few areas.

As I recently explained, three states (Texas, Florida, and Tennessee) accounted for more than a third of all ICE arrests, because those states mandate cooperation by local officials with immigration authorities.

When ICE can simply pick up a criminal alien from a “secure location” like a jail or prison, officers don’t need to hit the streets looking for them.

When the agency is barred by sanctuary laws from arresting those aliens as soon as they are released from state and local custody, however, it must go into the community looking for them, and the pervasiveness of such laws explains a separate chart in the Times article showing a rise in “at-large” arrests under Trump II.

A Toxic Mix of Stupidity and Political Calculation

Two weeks after Trump returned, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued an opinion finding that counties in his state could not hold criminal aliens on ICE detainers.

That, of course, forced ICE officers into neighborhoods looking for those criminal aliens, and soon, officials in the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes began vilifying the agency’s enforcement efforts, with Gov. Tim Walz (D) referring to ICE as “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo” and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) claiming the agency’s “activities are largely built around terrorizing people”.

That was a month before Frey told ICE to “Get the f*** out of Minneapolis”, and the situation has since devolved into a toxic mix of stupidity and political calculation with Walz, Frey, and the rest egging on (likely) well-meaning but misinformed and occasionally violent protestors who attempt to interpose themselves between ICE officers and arrest targets.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/newyorktimes-social.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:52.795383

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on.
House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir.","Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on MS NOW’s Morning Joe, where he made clear that, one year into Donald Trump’s term, House Democrats will continue to hold the Trump administration accountable for the corruption and extremism they are unleashing on American communities and their failure to fulfill the promise of lowering the high cost of living.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let’s bring in right now, House Majority—Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. I’m sorry there was a little time lapse to next year, still Minority Leader for now but before we go to that, I want to say, first of all, Independent voters, a plurality, close to a majority, are now calling for the elimination of ICE. I don’t think a lot of mainstream Democrats on the Hill want to do that, but the polls are breaking that way. So, Minority Leader Jeffries, before we get to funding for DHS and their brutal tactics which, by the way, it sounded even like Donald Trump was suggesting that they made a mistake in the killing of Renee Good. I’m curious about the Epstein Transparency Act that you passed well over a month ago. The Department of Justice was required by law, in an almost unanimous House vote and Senate vote, required to release all the files. They’ve only released about 1% of those files, most of those heavily redacted. What can you do, what can Democrats do, to answer the pleas of even MAGA Republicans—

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: When are they coming?—

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Who want these files released and want the White House to stop hiding them?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, good morning. The Department of Justice has completely and totally failed to comply with the law under that statute that was passed and of course signed by Donald Trump, almost unanimously enacted by both the House and the Senate. The DOJ was required to turn over the Epstein files by December 19th. A month has now passed, more than five million documents have failed to be released and the Department of Justice has not provided any reason that justifies their obstruction. The American people deserve the transparency and accountability connected to the release of the Epstein files. And, in my view, to the extent that Republicans are actually interested in making sure that that transparency occurs, then the Department of Justice needs to either come up to Capitol Hill and explain why they’ve failed to comply with the law or be held in contempt of Congress.

WILLIE GEIST: Leader Jeffries, as you know, Republicans, the Justice Department in particular, are saying there’s so many files, there’s millions of files, it’s going to take us a while. Are you buying that explanation and, if not, what do you suspect?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, from the very beginning of this whole sordid saga, Trump administration officials have claimed that they want to release these files, that they plan to release these files, they’re now compelled to release these files by a law that was passed in the Congress, and yet they continue to obstruct. And so, clearly, I think the American people can reasonably conclude they’re hiding something. Right? Who are they protecting is the question that we need to get a real answer to because the American people simply deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Leader Jeffries, let’s switch gears now and talk about the upcoming government funding bill, whether the government will perhaps even shut down as that deadline approaches. A thorny issue is funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular ICE, in the wake of that fatal shooting in Minneapolis a couple of weeks ago. Talk to us about the divisions that you and your colleagues feel. What happens next?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, ICE is completely and totally out of control. Donald Trump promised with respect to immigration enforcement that the administration was going to target violent felons who are here in the country illegally. That’s something the American people support. The American people do not support the targeting, the arrest, the detention, the brutalization of American citizens, certainly do not find acceptable the killing of Renee Nicole Good and the targeting of law-abiding immigrant families and communities. And so, I think from our standpoint, and we’ll have a discussion in about an hour in our Caucus meeting about the path forward, but clearly there needs to be accountability mechanisms that is put into law so that ICE conducts itself like every other law enforcement agency in the United States of America. That’s not too much to ask. So some of the things that we believe are appropriate in this instance, are demanding be part of any final bill, are a warrant requirement. That’s common sense. ICE should not be able to storm houses of worship, hospitals and schools. That’s common sense. That relates to protocols that exist for every other law enforcement agency in the country. ICE should have a use-of-force standard. None currently exists. Of course, the notion that masked ICE agents are running around brutalizing American citizens, utilizing taxpayer dollars, completely and totally unacceptable. And so these are the types of things that we believe should be put into place to get ICE under control, consistent with the demands of the American people.

MIKE BARNICLE: Leader Jeffries, the Department of Justice is not the same Department of Justice that existed 12 or 14 months ago. Hundreds of prosecutors have left. The FBI has been stripped of a lot of skillful agents who left the Department of Justice. I realize you are in the minority, but what can be done to restore the integrity and the skill level of the Department of Justice?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on. From our standpoint, we’ve got two pillars that we need to proceed with as we move forward. One, of course, is affordability and making sure that we are driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken healthcare system. Donald Trump promised that costs would go down on day one. Year one has passed. Costs haven’t gone down. They’ve gone up. But in addition to the affordability agenda that we’ll aggressively push, we need accountability. And Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice, they’ve weaponized this institution against political enemies. Highly qualified individuals have left, and they’re proceeding with impunity. And so from my standpoint, there have to be consequences for some of the outrageous things that have been done. Congress needs to function like a separate and co-equal branch of government as opposed to what my Republican colleagues have done, which is a reckless rubber stamp for Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. We’re going to continue to press the case, to elevate, to make the Department of Justice great again, but the reality is that work is not really going to happen in a meaningful fashion until Democrats take back control of the House of Representatives after the November midterm elections.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right. House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.

The effort was a threat by the administration to withhold billions of dollars in education funding from states and schools that refused to sign a document attesting that they did not have diversity and equity programs. Education groups sued in federal court and won a favorable ruling in August, which the government then appealed.

But on Wednesday, the administration withdrew its appeal. The federal judge in Maryland who heard the case, Stephanie Gallagher, ruled against the Trump administration on multiple grounds. She found that the administration had not followed proper procedure in attempting to withhold the funding, and that the underlying policy threatened educators’ free speech in the classroom.

Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said the case was the most important of the 22 lawsuits that her union had filed, along with partner groups, against President Donald Trump in his second term, because of the precedent it would establish for limiting executive power.

“You cannot, by executive fiat, rewrite 60 years of educational opportunity,” Weingarten said in an interview, referring to the civil rights laws that protect students from racial discrimination in schools.

Orange County Democrats claim ICE is taking things too far in Central Florida

Democrats in Orange County are urging residents to organize and oppose the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Central Florida, as the agency reportedly plans to expand its operations in the area.Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Democratic candidate for the state House in Orange County who immigrated from Venezuela, joined other candidates and county party leaders to encourage community involvement. Reports indicate that ICE is considering opening a facility near the Beachline in Orange County, and there have been accounts of large numbers of ICE agents renting hotel rooms.According to the Orange County Jail, as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday, there were 201 individuals held with immigration holds and local charges, and 138 people with ICE holds and no local charges.

Democrats in Orange County are urging residents to organize and oppose the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Central Florida, as the agency reportedly plans to expand its operations in the area.

Samuel Vilchez Santiago, a Democratic candidate for the state House in Orange County who immigrated from Venezuela, joined other candidates and county party leaders to encourage community involvement.

Reports indicate that ICE is considering opening a facility near the Beachline in Orange County, and there have been accounts of large numbers of ICE agents renting hotel rooms.

According to the Orange County Jail, as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday, there were 201 individuals held with immigration holds and local charges, and 138 people with ICE holds and no local charges.

The organization hosted a press conference Wednesday morning in Downtown Orlando asking residents to speak out against the current administration. Republicans, though, are encouraging ICE to continue doing its job.

“The happiest place in the world has turned in to show me your papers city,” said on of the Democratic Party leaders.

Within the last week, the Orange County Democratic Party said there have been confirmed reports of ICE seeking warehouse space in Orlando. Democratic leaders said there have also been confirmed reports of up to 200 hotel rooms booked by ICE in and around Orange County.

Leaders gathered on Wednesday to speak out against those moves and to say ICE is making residents live in fear.

“A person was taken, we don’t know where they are, is that the country we want to build?” another Democratic leader voiced.

Governor Ron DeSantis said ICE is simply doing the job it’s asked to do. He said its partnership in Florida is the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history.

In the wake of those operations, democratic speakers said they want Central Floridians to be informed, prepared, and knowledgeable about their rights, and that these implications will extend far beyond just immigrants.

“The price will be at the grocery store, when we need a roof fixed after a hurricane,” another Democratic leader said.

DeSantis said he is proud of ICE’s work and said the mission will continue in the state.

In addition to the Governor, Channel 9 has reached out to multiple Republican leaders and the Orange County GOP.

Republican Representative Byron Donalds responded, saying, “What Democrats are doing to obstruct, impede, and sabotage ICE is treasonous. The American people granted President Trump a mandate to deport illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. As Governor, any Florida official who blocks these lawful actions will be removed from office.”

We also received a lengthy statement from the Orange County GOP:

It should be of serious concern to all residents of Orange County when any elected official or community leader takes actions or supports efforts that hinder law enforcement. Recent statements and actions by local Democratic leadership appear to align with advocating for individuals who break the law rather than supporting those who uphold it.

The Republican Party of Orange County stands firmly with our law enforcement professionals and with victims of crime. We support fair, respectful treatment of those who protect our communities and the vigorous prosecution of those who violate our laws.

Central Florida, including Orange County, experiences a disproportionately high volume of human trafficking activity. Far too often, victims — including women and children — are trafficked across state lines or international borders by heartless criminals, and it is law enforcement that leads the rescue and recovery efforts.

Federal, state, and local agencies — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — play a critical role in identifying and dismantling trafficking networks. These operations also require the support of facilities, transportation, and safe housing to ensure that survivors receive the care and resources they need.

If local Democrat leaders were genuinely concerned about the well-being of our tourism and hospitality economy, they would stand with law enforcement and support efforts to protect vulnerable individuals and public safety.

Our Governor and President are charged with enforcing the law. Florida is a state where justice is not negotiable — Orange County should be committed to upholding the rule of law and delivering justice to those who deserve it.

Don’t Minneapolis our Orlando.

In a statement, a Trump administration spokesperson appeared to signal that targeting Maine was a political response to the ongoing feud between the president and the state’s governor, Democrat Janet Mills.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” said spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

But rumours have swirled that Maine was singled out for its significant Somali American population in the cities of Portland and Lewiston. Estimates put the total number of Somali Americans in the state at about 3,000.

Trump has repeatedly denounced the Somali community over the past several months, comparing its members to “garbage” at a December cabinet meeting. As recently as Tuesday, he used his White House podium to call Somalis and Somali Americans “ a lot of very low IQ people”.

Racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric has been a trademark of Trump’s campaigns for public office, and he has repeatedly singled out specific groups – including Haitians and Mexicans – to falsely tie their immigrant identity to pervasive criminal activity.

Parallels with Minnesota

Trump’s focus on the Somali community comes after a handful of members were implicated in a fraud scandal in Minnesota, a midwestern state where immigration enforcement operations were launched in December.

Those efforts have been marked by violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, and one woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was shot dead in her car after an interaction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Fears that those tensions could spill into Maine dominated a Wednesday news conference with city officials in Portland.

Mayor Mark Dion told reporters that immigrant communities in the region felt “anxious and fearful” as ICE agents began their crackdown.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” he explained.

He also questioned whether a heavy-handed operation was necessary to address immigration infractions in the area, and he called on ICE to adopt different tactics than it had in Minnesota.

“I want to underscore one important point: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,” Dion said.

“Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful,” he added. “What we’ve been concerned with, as a council, is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.”

Nevertheless, Dion expressed optimism that ICE would adopt a more tailored approach to apprehending local suspects.

While the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has seen nearly 2,000 immigration officers flood its streets, the mayor predicted that Maine would not see the same “massing of federal agents”.

“We’re seeing very individualised activity by ICE. A person here, a neighbourhood there,” he said. “Their conduct, at least as it is current in Maine, seems to be focused, which would indicate to me – and this is the speculation – that they’re functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant.”

That, he said, marked a departure from the “random, show-me-your-papers kind of experience” that residents had experienced in Minnesota.

Outrage at ICE operations

Still, while Dion advocated for a wait-and-see approach to the ICE operation, other city officials took a harder stance.

One Portland city councillor, Wesley Pelletier, described the unfolding raids as part of “an agenda of white nationalism and might makes right”.

“This is a war of terror that’s being waged on our city by the federal government,” Pelletier said. “We’ve seen people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks.”

So far, Fox News quoted ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde as saying the agency had made 50 arrests so far as part of operation “Catch of the Day”. Hyde added that ICE had identified nearly 1,400 individuals to detain in Maine.

Wednesday’s statement from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted four arrests as examples, showing people from Sudan, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Angola.

It described the four individuals as “the worst of the worst” and accused them of crimes ranging from aggravated assault to endangering the welfare of a child, though it was unclear in one case if the accusation had resulted in a conviction.

“We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,” McLaughlin said in the statement.

But Democratic officials in the state suggested that the Trump administration had refused to coordinate in the lead-up to “Catch of the Day”, heightening anxiety on the local level.

On January 14, nearly a week before the operation was launched, Governor Mills posted on social media that she had “attempted, unsuccessfully thus far, to confirm” the upcoming surge in federal immigration enforcement.

In a video statement, she said the state had reached out to local governments in Portland and Lewiston to prepare. She added that she too felt “angry” about the expected surge.

“Our goal, as always, will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused. Those tactics are not welcome here to the people of Maine.”

She also took a jab at the trend of federal agents using masks and other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

“Look, Maine knows what good law enforcement looks like because our law enforcement are held to high professional standards,” Mills said. “They are accountable to the law. And I’ll tell you this: They don’t wear a mask to shield their identities, and they don’t arrest people in order to fill a quota.”

A political rivalry

Mills and Trump have long been political adversaries, with their feud erupting in a public forum. In February last year, shortly after Trump returned to office for a second term, he hosted a White House gathering for governors, where he called out Mills personally.

“Is Maine here? The governor of Maine?” Trump said while outlining policies barring transgender athletes from sporting events. “Are you not going to comply with it?”

“I’m complying with state and federal law,” Mills responded. The tension escalated from there.

“You’d better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump shot back.

“See you in court,” Mills replied.

“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a really easy one. And enjoy your life after, governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics,” he said.

The interaction made national news and cemented the frosty relationship between the two leaders, with Trump demanding an apology and slamming the Democratic governor for months afterwards.

His administration also took a series of escalating actions designed to target Mills, including launching an education probe in her state, suspending a marine research grant and freezing other federal funds to Maine.

In response to this week’s ICE deployment, Mills issued a short statement acknowledging the Trump administration’s latest efforts.

“Together, we will continue to place the safety and civil rights of Maine people above all else, and remain vigilant in our defense of due process and the rule of law,” she wrote.

Maine is set to hold its next gubernatorial race in 2026, as part of the year’s midterm election cycle.

Having served two terms as governor, Mills is not eligible for re-election and will instead be making a run for the US Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Susan Collins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26021760239518-1769044359.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:52.131211

The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction.

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger.","The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked an injunction Wednesday that prevented federal immigration officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

A Friday ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez had prevented the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detaining or tear gassing people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest, including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of over 3,000 immigration officers and agents in the Twin Cities.

The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction. Ten of the 11 judges in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the stay, were appointed by Republican presidents, including four judges appointed by President Donald Trump.

The court decisions stem from a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU. The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year, either in cars or on foot, when they were threatened, pepper-sprayed or arrested by federal agents, according to the lawsuit.

The Trump administration argued in a motion filed on Tuesday that the lawsuit is based on five incidents in December that plaintiffs can “only speculate may recur,” and that plaintiffs can’t establish constitutional violations. Homeland Security said that the district court’s finding of a pattern of misconduct by ICE agents was “overblown.”

Federal immigration agents are facing backlash from local leaders, businesses and residents for their behavior as raids have ramped up in Minnesota.

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good at the hands of federal agent Jonathan Ross has galvanized the opposition to the federal operation.

In the past few weeks, federal agents have shot a second person during an arrest; arrested U.S. citizens including a barely-clothed 56-year-old Hmong man who was misidentified by officers; and deployed tear gas and other chemical irritants against observers, protestors and bystanders, including at Roosevelt High School during dismissal hours after Good was killed.

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger. As an example, the government argued that tailing federal agents’ vehicles — an increasingly common tactic among community patrollers looking to disrupt ICE operations — is an “inherently dangerous activity.”

Menendez, in the preliminary injunction, had declared following ICE vehicles to be a legal and protected activity that does not justify a vehicle stop or arrest by agents.

The Reformer spoke to a protester, a U.S. citizen, who was detained for hours last week after following ICE vehicles and was never charged.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs of the December lawsuit, drove to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:26.387556

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE.

Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A.
had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.","The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting T.S.A. director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis earlier this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered Ms. McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Representative Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised T.S.A. workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is currently funded in the United States.

They also asked Ms. McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A. had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. Ms. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to Ms. McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Representative Tim Kennedy, Democrat of New York, asked how many T.S.A. employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but Ms. McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Mr. Kennedy pressed Ms. McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, Ms. McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Mr. Trump.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:40.934522

But without question, ICE abolition advocates have a lot of momentum among congressional Democrats and ICE resisters nationally (including, notably, Mayor Zohran Mamdani).
Has Trump’s toxic immigration crackdown now made ICE abolition a mainstream position with little political downside?
While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo.
The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024.","For two overriding reasons, Democrats are intensively debating what to say and do about the future of ICE. First and most obviously, that agency is running wild in Minneapolis and other cities, pursuing a very deliberate policy of terrorizing immigrant communities and their allies in order to (a) encourage “self-deportation” and (b) titillate Donald Trump’s MAGA base. ICE has become the tip of a spear that seems aimed not only at mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, but at the military occupation of politically hostile territory by an increasingly authoritarian administration.

Second, an appropriations package that includes money for ICE (along with the rest of DHS, plus multiple other federal agencies) has become the flash point in another potential (if partial) government-shutdown cliff on January 30, which is when the stopgap-spending bill that ended last year’s total government shutdown expires. Many Democrats within and beyond Congress want to dramatize their opposition to what ICE is doing by voting against the new money, even though (as other Democrats argue) it won’t stop ICE for a moment thanks to the special slush fund for mass deportation created by last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

While nearly all Democrats oppose both current ICE tactics and Trump’s entire mass-deportation regime, the funding fight has exposed an increasingly large gulf between those who advocate abolishing ICE and those who seek to reform the agency. The latter camp isn’t necessarily a solid bloc; there’s language in the above-mentioned spending bill that authorizes body cameras and other measures for ICE accountability that some reformers consider inadequate. But without question, ICE abolition advocates have a lot of momentum among congressional Democrats and ICE resisters nationally (including, notably, Mayor Zohran Mamdani). One very recent poll from Economist-YouGov showed self-identified Democrats favoring the abolition of ICE by a margin of 77 percent to 19 percent (Americans generally were split right down the middle on the proposition). So is this the line in the sand the party generally should draw? Has Trump’s toxic immigration crackdown now made ICE abolition a mainstream position with little political downside?

While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo. ICE has been around since 2003. Its agents weren’t masked until March 2025. ICE (along with the allied Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations agencies) wasn’t deployed to achieve mass deportation until a Trump executive order one year ago yesterday. The administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden didn’t publicly defend brutal tactics or accuse immigration-enforcement protesters of being “terrorists.” Columnist Will Bunch recently spoke out in opposition to Democratic efforts to reform ICE on grounds that “You can’t reform fascism.” Were the Obama and Biden administrations “fascist”?

More than a few progressives (and particularly advocates for undocumented immigrants) did indeed believe that enforcement of immigration laws generally, and deportation practices specifically, were too harsh during past Democratic administrations. In 2020, famously, most Democratic presidential candidates called for the decriminalization (or, in some cases, abolition of felony charges for immigration violations) of illegal border crossings. The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024. And as recently as September, a Washington Post–Ipsos survey showed only 29 percent of Americans trusted Democrats more than Republicans on immigration policy.

So despite widespread and steadily increasing public disapproval of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Democrats aren’t on such solid ground that they can embrace some total abandonment of immigration enforcement without courting political peril. There’s no evidence that Americans actually want the “open borders” stance that Republicans have falsely accused Democrats of embracing in the past. Embracing it now makes little sense. The broadest and strongest position for Democrats right now is the abolition of both mass deportation and ICE terror tactics, alongside a new path to citizenship for noncriminal immigrants and fairer and more uniform enforcement of immigration laws without the sort of violence and cruelty perpetrated and celebrated by Trump, J.D. Vance, Kristi Noem, and Stephen Miller. Anyone who thinks such a position represents a surrender to MAGA needs to remember how and why these terrible people rose to power in the first place.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1fc/007/6707938cb73235ced6b571189472b9d18f-abolish-ice.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:31.449110

In comments provided to the Guardian, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency of ICE, said: “Some of the arrests of the worst of the worst from the first day of operations include criminal illegal aliens convicted of horrific crimes including aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.” The government provided criminal histories related to four arrestees out of approximately 50 ICE said had been arrested so far, with no details on the backgrounds of the others.

The move follows similar efforts occurring in Minneapolis over recent weeks that have sparked demonstrations and prompted criticism of forceful methods used by ICE and border patrol officers, both on people pursued for deportation and on protesters and activists who warn communities when immigration enforcement activity is spotted nearby.

Thousands of enforcement officers have been mobilized to Minnesota. ICE has faced a storm of criticism, including from local officials, after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month by an ICE officer, followed by the FBI excluding local prosecutors from the official investigation into the tragedy. The large Somali American community in Minnesota has been a particular and repeated target for Donald Trump.

Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, told Fox News on Tuesday that close to 50 people have been detained so far in Maine as part of what she described as an immigration enforcement surge.

Hyde also said ICE has compiled a list of 1,400 individuals in Maine it intends to target. ICE officers shown in TV footage on Fox News making arrests so far were masked and all had their faces blurred, while the faces of those being apprehended were not.

Many asylum seekers from a number of African nations who have entered the US have made Maine their home, adding to the Somali community that began forming there in the early 2000s when refugees settled in Lewiston. Maine is still largely white and has one of the oldest populations nationwide.

Meanwhile, many businesses have increasingly turned to immigrant workers to address labor shortages, as many native-born workers have retired or left the labor force.

The US attorney’s office in Maine had hinted at the coming operation in a statement issued Monday urging the public to demonstrate peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the US attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Tuesday, the mayor of Lewiston, Carl Sheline, said in a statement that ICE agents had increased their presence in the state’s second-largest city. He urged calm and encouraged residents to “check in on one another”.

Last week, the Trump administration said it would end temporary protected status (TPS) for Somalis living in the US, giving hundreds of people two months to depart or face removal.

The administration had first signaled plans to revoke protections for Somali nationals in November, when Trump posted on his Truth Social account about Minnesota, which has a large Somali population, writing: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f19645d4ca44f3b064e3b16c25aa6bea5afa429/382_0_3815_3052/master/3815.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b6b056e18519ac7468f365144c343ea",N,,2026-01-22 00:36:44.371740

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy assistant director Patricia Hyde told Fox News Tuesday that the agency has arrested nearly 50 people in Maine as part of an immigration enforcement surge.

Her remarks offered the first confirmation from the agency that it is intensifying operations in the state.

In a written statement Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that an immigration enforcement effort dubbed ""Operation Catch of the Day"" was underway in Maine, but did not provide specific numbers on how many people had been arrested and how many agents are involved.

The numbers cited by Fox would represent a major escalation. For comparison, last year ICE arrested an average of 24 people per month, according to the Deportation Data Project.

Hyde told Fox News her agency has a target list of 1,400 people in Maine. That would represent about 10% of all immigrants without permanent legal status in the state, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.

A growing number of videos purporting to show arrests have cropped up in the last two days, mostly in Lewiston and Greater Portland.

Local officials in both cities say they are not receiving communication from ICE or other federal agencies.

At a press conference Wednesday, Portland officials pushed back ICE's tactics.

Mayor Mark Dion said ICE's use of force in other cities around the country has put Portland on edge.

""While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,"" he said.

City councilor Wes Pelletier rejected the need for an operation at all.

""No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country,"" he said.

Other councilors say residents are forming support networks to deliver food and other basic needs to immigrant families too afraid to leave home.

Amid widespread fear of immigration enforcement, Portland Public Schools superintendent Ryan Scallon says attendance is down 15-20% at certain schools.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,"" Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said in a statement. ""These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country. Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

On Wednesday afternoon, ICE issued a press release saying it was targeting ""the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.""

It identified four detainees:

Dominic Ali, a Sudanese man convicted of false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice, and violation of a protective order.

Ambessa Berhe, an Ethiopian woman convicted of aggravated assault and cocaine possession.

Elmara Correia, an Angolan woman who had previously been arrested for endangering the welfare of a child.

Dany Lopez-Cortez, a Guatemalan man convicted of operating under the influence of alcohol.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the release. “We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state. On the first day of operations, we arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.”

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond.
He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.
He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.
“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said.","Demonstrators outside the Whipple Building say they are seeing unpredictable releases of immigration detainees as an attorney warns that the federal bond system has not recovered from last summer’s policy changes and ongoing litigation.

Protests at the federal building have continued for two weeks following the death of Renee Good, who was shot by an ICE agent. People gathering outside said they have watched detainees walk out of the facility or get dropped off at random locations across the Twin Cities in below-zero temperatures and without basic necessities.

Legal observer Rachel Gerdes said she saw several young people released Tuesday evening.

“Yesterday, I was here around like 5 p.m., they were just dropping kids that had been detained out in front of the Whipple Building here and leaving them to fend for themselves,” said Gerdes. “They didn’t even have winter coats. Some of them I don’t even know if they had their phone.”

Gerdes said she helped a 19-year-old woman who had no way to get home. “She ended up saying she needed a ride, cause she had to get home. My friend and I drove her home.”

Gerdes said she later helped the woman’s 17-year-old brother, who was released sometime later.

Immigration attorney David Wilson said these kinds of releases have become more common.

“What used to be kind of an orderly process for letting someone out of custody has turned into a little bit of a chaos process, a chaotic process where we’re trying to find people way late into the night and they get released without much warning at this point,” he said.

He said the process is even more complicated if a detained immigrant is transferred to an out-of-state facility.

“When people are taken out of state for their custody or detention, it’s not just that they get separated from their families. It’s really a challenge to get people back to Minnesota, in a orderly fashion, and because when they’re picked up, they may not have been wearing a winter jacket and ready for that trip,” Wilson said.

In July 2025, a Trump administration policy sought to eliminate bond for most undocumented immigrants. Federal courts blocked the policy, but Wilson and other advocates believe the system has not returned to normal.

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond. We’re just fighting for the opportunity to be heard,” he said.

He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.

“You know you go to criminal court; you’re expecting you’re going to be able to pay a bond and be heard, not in immigration, not today. You have people have to fight for that opportunity.”

He said the immigration enforcement surge is also making it harder for judges to respond to requests.

“Right now, it’s taking about seven to 10 days to get a bond hearing, and so a person sits in custody for that long,” Wilson said.

He said in 2024, a bond hearing could be set within two to three days of detainment.

Bond amounts vary widely, but Wilson said they typically range from $1,500 to $7,000 and must be paid in full.

He said the process determines whether someone goes home or remains in custody. Some families and organizations raise funds to help immigrants.

“Often, bond is everything. It is definitely like a coliseum-type argument where all the arguments come out on the table at once,” Wilson said

Wilson said bond is only one part of the deportation process and determines whether someone fights their case from home or from detention. He said frequent transfers between facilities are also causing delays, with some detainees missing scheduled bond hearings because they are moved before a judge can review their case. He said people who are detained a second time may be required to pay a new bond, and the amount does not carry over from a previous case.

He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.

“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said. “The rules keep changing and becoming more difficult to comply with,” Wilson said. “Families are waiting and hoping, but the process is moving slower than ever.”

Wilson said eligibility for bond depends on a judge’s assessment of flight risk and danger, and certain criminal offenses, including some minor ones, can make a person ineligible. If someone wins their deportation case, the bond is refunded.

Wilson said if a person did not comply with the requirements of their case or lost their proceedings, the bond could be kept by the government.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man, Garrison Gibson, with a deportation order from 2023 in Minneapolis on Jan. 11, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an e-mailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued, relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Recent arrests shine a light on tactics

Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has placed a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Memo shown to ‘select’ officials

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose it to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

Memo says ICE officers are told to rely solely on administrative warrants

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests, even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York, said the memo “flies in the face” of what the Fourth Amendment protects against and what ICE itself has historically said are its authorities.

She said there’s an “enormous potential for overreach, for mistakes and we’ve seen that those can happen with very, very serious consequences.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/53e35be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+156/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F43%2Fe8%2Fbcd3b6f0df8b64cb7e8391258e4c%2Fecd7e2093e1048f484d277a5a60cf423,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:40.428165

Leaders in the state’s largest and most-diverse cities, Portland and Lewiston, continued to criticize the operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as “terror and intimidation tactics” that threaten families. Many in those communities and elsewhere have documented with photos and videos the arrests and actions by ICE, often by masked agents.

Fox News reported that ICE had identified about 1,400 targets in Maine, and had made 50 arrests as of early Wednesday morning. The Department of Homeland Security later said in a statement the effort is targeting the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” citing people accused of committing crimes ranging from aggravated assault to operating under the influence of alcohol.

The department went on to criticize Gov. Janet Mills and “her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine” for standing in the way of their operations.

Mills, in a statement late Wednesday, didn’t back down.

“If the federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Indeed, some residents have reported the detention of family members that have no criminal records.

A Westbrook mother said her 18-year-old son Jean-Pierre Obiang, an accounting student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained by ICE after a minor traffic incident outside the Westbrook Market Basket. Obiang and his mom, Sandrine Koumba, are asylum seekers from the central African county of Gabon, and have lived in Maine for three years. A background check of Obiang through the Maine State Bureau of Identification verified that he does not have a criminal record.

“You flee somewhere because you are being persecuted, and you arrive in a place where you say ‘Oh thank you God, I have arrived here; I am protected,'” Koumba said. “Then you realize that, actually, we are not safe.”

A Portland mom of four from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who also had no criminal record and a pending asylum application, was detained after agents followed her home from dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

A migrant worker in Lewiston who saw ICE agents approaching doors in their neighborhood said fears were high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks. In Portland’s Parkside neighborhood, residents blew whistles, honked car horns and called the statewide ICE activity hotline when six agents knocked on the door of a residential building, but did not detain anyone.

CITIES, SCHOOLS REACT

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said.

“Imagine you are a parent and you step out to put your kid on a school bus, and by the time you turn around you’re surrounded by ICE agents,” added Councilor Pious Ali. “Who is going to take care of that child?”

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said the agency’s presence in Maine amounted to “terror and intimidation tactics.”

“These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,” he said in a statement. “Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.”

Westbrook Mayor David Morse, whose city also has a large number of immigrants, denounced the agency for an incident where he said an agent targeted a U.S. citizen who was peacefully observing an enforcement action, describing it as “outrageous behavior.”

Portland’s school district also announced that it will temporarily suspend off-campus lunches for high schoolers to minimize, “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions,” and reported a decrease in student attendance Tuesday, while South Portland’s school board canceled a public forum Thursday because too many families were scared to attend, the board chair said.

Maine’s federal delegation had mixed reactions to “Operation Catch of the Day.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, criticized federal agencies for not sharing any details with members of Congress, while Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, said he supports ICE’s actions as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said individuals in the country legally should not be detained, but also expressed support for some arrests.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity,” Collins said. “They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.”

Federal officials have not said how long the operation in Maine will last.

Lawmakers at a legislative hearing sought more details from State Police about the cost of training officers to participate in the program, with one lawmaker saying she hoped there were no barriers preventing more departments from participating.

“We should be acting as aggressively as we possibly can to make sure everybody’s trained, everybody’s participating, everybody’s on the same page to execute the president’s agenda,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, who co-chairs the legislative subcommittee overseeing State Police.

The program is a “force multiplier” that allows state and local agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine duties, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement site.

Through the agreement, state police can contact ICE if it believes a person it comes into contact with during traffic stops, pursuits, investigations or other routine enforcement activity may be in the country illegally. ICE can then put an immigration detainer on that person.

Arkansas State Police entered into the agreement after a state law passed during last year’s legislative session required state police, the Department of Corrections and county sheriffs to do so.

Arkansas National Guard requests immigration enforcement authority

President Donald Trump has made deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally one of the cornerstones of his second term. His administration has sent thousands of immigration enforcement agents into major Democrat-run cities with a stated goal of arresting and deporting immigrants with criminal convictions.

However, those without criminal histories and U.S. citizens have found themselves caught up in the crackdown as well. Most recently, the shooting death of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent sparked nationwide protests.

Neighboring Tennessee is moving to do more in the immigration crackdown as well. Republican lawmakers there recently unveiled plans for bills that would require public institutions such as public schools, vehicle registration offices and city governments to track and report immigration status.

Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar told legislators that since the 287(g) agreement was signed, all but a handful of state police troopers have completed the required 60-hour training.

Sen. Joshua Bryant, a Republican from Rogers, said that with the fiscal session approaching, he wanted to know if expenses related to the programs were being tracked for state police and the county jails that hold immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

Hagar said he believed county jails were being reimbursed, but was unaware of how much they were being reimbursed. Troopers did the 60-hour training in between regular calls for service during their shifts, he said. ASP spokesperson Cindy Murphy said in an email that the 287(g) training was added to troopers’ regular training requirements, so they were not seeking reimbursement from the federal government for those costs.

“It’s not had an impact on our agency as far as operations are concerned,” Hagar told lawmakers.

Hagar said federal immigration resources in Arkansas were “very minimal,” and that most of those resources were taken up by picking up immigrants in local jails to take them to federal immigration detention.

Sen. Terry Rice, a Republican from Waldron, said that while he supported efforts to deport immigrants who have committed crimes, he was also concerned about the potential for state police to assist federal immigration authorities in detaining immigrants without criminal histories.

“Is there anything outside of your daily work that y’all are doing currently in coordination with federal agencies, Homeland Security, ICE, as far as going out and just seeking anything more than people with criminal charges?” he asked.

The agency was not participating in any operations like the one Rice described, Hagar said.

He said troopers have been told there is a difference between an immigrant who was brought here as a child and who doesn’t have a criminal history, and an immigrant who is arrested for a crime.

“We’ve explained to them that we expect them to use good judgment and common sense discretion that they have under the law,” Hagar said. “And you know, we trust that they’re going to take that responsibility seriously.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47649/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_6442-1024x7681769039414.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=YHdcH_oM,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:58.057216

6:20 p.m.: ICE agents detain 18-year-old USM student after minor car accident

ICE agents detained a 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine after a minor car crash Tuesday morning.

Jean-Pierre Obiang was on his way to USM, where he is studying accounting, when he called his mother, Sandrine Koumba, from the Westbrook Market Basket asking for proof of their car insurance, Koumba said in an interview Wednesday. The call was cut off after 36 seconds. Koumba was able to speak briefly with her son after multiple attempts to call him back, and he told her he was being detained by ICE agents.

Tiara Sandborn, the wife of the driver of the other car involved in the crash, said Obiang and her husband, Shawn Chastain, exchanged contact information and were about to drive away when three ICE officers showed up, saying they ran Obiang’s license plates and he was a person of interest, Sandborn said. Chastain tried to tell the agents that Obiang hadn’t done anything wrong, but they pushed him into his car.

Koumba said the car was registered in her name, not her son’s, and that he has no criminal history. A criminal background check on Obiang in Maine was not immediately returned Wednesday night.

“He had a license. He’s enrolled in school here. He was not engaged in any type of criminal behavior,” Sandborn said. “He had a minor accident that occurred that subjected him to be vulnerable and then basically kidnapped off the streets.”

Koumba and her family are asylum-seekers from Gabon, a nation on the West African coast that sits right on the equator. They have been living in Westbrook for three years.

Obiang was allowed one phone call and told his mother he had been moved to Burlington, Massachusetts. He was told he’d be moved to another facility the next day, but did not know where.

6 p.m. Gov. Janet Mills says state is monitoring ICE activity, committed to civil rights

Gov. Janet Mills responded to ICE operations in Maine Wednesday, saying her administration is committed to ensuring the safety and civil rights of Maine people are protected.

She said the state is working with municipal officials and organizations to monitor ICE activity.

“If the federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” Mills said in a written statement. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.”

5:50 p.m.: Lewiston mayor says ICE tactics causing damage to the state

In a statement Wednesday, Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline decried ICE’s enforcement efforts in Maine, which began ramping up Tuesday.

“ICE’s terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,” the statement said.

“These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country. Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.”

5:45 p.m.: Maine woman interfered with local law enforcement assuming they were ICE, police say

A Maine woman interfered with Brewer Police activity, thinking they were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, police say.

Mary Conmee, 63, of Orrington, has been served a court summons for disorderly conduct and obstructing government administration, the Brewer Police Department said in a social media post on Wednesday.

Officers were investigating a threat against Brewer schools Wednesday morning and staged near a Brewer residence to attempt to contact a person of interest. During the operation, Conmee “deliberately drove to the scene and interfered with police activity by repeatedly sounding an air horn, refusing lawful orders to leave, and yelling at expletives at officers,” the post stated.

“The woman stated that she ‘didn’t want ICE’ in her neighborhood,” the department’s notice said. “Her actions interfered with legitimate law enforcement operations and created a real risk to the investigating officers.”

Police later determined the person of interest was not involved in the school threat, the department said. The threat stemmed from similar “swatting” incidents at other Maine schools on Wednesday, police say, and there was no credible threat to Brewer schools.

5:30 p.m.: Maine State Police won’t work with feds on immigration enforcement

Maine State Police are already following the policies outlined in a new law limiting the ability of local law enforcement to collaborate with federal immigration authorities — even though the law is not scheduled to take effect until this summer.

Gov. Janet Mills announced last month she would allow LD 1971, one of the most controversial bills of last year’s legislative session, to become law without her signature. The measure will prohibit state, county and local law enforcement officers from investigating, detaining, arresting or searching a person solely for immigration enforcement purposes.

LD 1971 is not scheduled to take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session ends, meaning its effective date is expected to come in mid-July. However, Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck has already issued a directive to his agency implementing the underlying policies of the law, a spokesperson for the department said Wednesday.

“Directives are a regular part of the first responder world, and this one was made internally by the Commissioner and was not prompted by any specific event or federal activity,” spokesperson Shannon Moss said in an email.

Officers will still be able to work with federal agents on criminal investigations and task forces, so long as the primary purpose is not immigration enforcement.

However, the law would not allow local officers to be placed under the supervision of federal authorities for the purpose of working on immigration enforcement, or allow police to use federal immigration officers as interpreters. Local police also won’t be allowed to transfer a person to immigration authorities without a court order or criminal warrant.

5:20 p.m.: Portland officials decry ICE tactics as enforcement effort enters second day

City officials in Maine’s largest city questioned the need for increased immigration enforcement during a Wednesday press conference as they attempted to reassure a fearful public.

Mayor Mark Dion and members of the City Council said they continue to hear from frightened and traumatized community members as reports of people being detained in public places mounted this week in Portland and neighboring cities.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said about constituents and members of the immigrant community in Portland.

He said officials are doing everything they can to direct resources to the affected communities, along with reiterating their rights and responsibilities if approached by federal immigration officers.

Several officials urged residents to observe and record enforcement actions without interfering.

“The best thing you can do is be the best possible witness,” Dion said, reiterating his statement last week challenging “the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.”

4:40 p.m.: Susan Collins issues statement on increased ICE arrests in Maine

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the lone Republican in Maine’s delegation, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon on the initial set of ICE arrests in the state.

“Immigrants have long been an important part of our state and they continue to make valuable contributions to our communities. People who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations. They should be able to continue to go to work, school, and other public places and carry on with their normal lives. If for some reason an individual who is here legally is improperly detained, they should seek assistance through advocacy networks and the legal system,” she said in the statement.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity. They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.

“I have advocated for providing body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE personnel. At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety. Our proposed funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes $20 million for body cameras and $2 million for de-escalation training, which could help protect both ICE agents and the general public. I hope that Congress will adopt these measures quickly.”

Last week, Collins said she supported the deportation of criminals but did not “see the rationale for a large number of ICE agents to come” to Maine.

4:35 p.m.: Court orders ICE to give reason for detaining Portland asylum seeker

A Portland resident from Angola who has filed for asylum is asking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to explain why he was detained during a routine check-in Tuesday at the field office in Scarborough.

Advertisement

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered ICE to provide a cause for the detainment of Yanick Joao Carneiro by noon the following day, court records show.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Stacey Neumann came a day after Carneiro and his attorney filed a petition for a judge to consider whether he is being jailed unlawfully. Neumann also temporarily ordered that Carneiro not be transferred out of Maine “to provide the Court with a fair opportunity to review the merits of the petition and rule on any contested issues of jurisdiction.”

According to the petition, Carneiro entered the country from Angola in April 2023 and is not a U.S. citizen. The Department of Homeland Security then detained him according to the petition, but he was subsequently released. Carneiro applied for asylum, according to the order, and has a hearing on the matter scheduled for November 2027 in Massachusetts.

2:55 p.m.: Jared Golden says ICE enforcement is legitimate, as long as it targets criminal activity

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that ramped up in his hometown of Lewiston and in the Portland area this week as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Golden issued a brief statement Wednesday afternoon after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed ICE agents are focusing on Maine under “Operation Catch of the Day,” which launched Tuesday.

“So long as this remains a targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activities, then I believe it legitimately serves the public interest,” Golden said in a statement.

2:50 p.m.: Owner of East Ender restaurant says he’s trying to make staff feel safe

Karl Deuben, who owns East Ender on Middle Street in Portland, said he has sent a message to his staff about ICE’s presence in Maine, posted signs delineating the restaurant’s public and private spaces, reposted information from the ACLU, clarified the definition of a warrant, and reminded staff to call him immediately if ICE officers enter the building.

“The most important thing I mentioned to our staff is that interacting with ICE outside the business is different than inside the business,” he said. “They do have a legal right to be on premise and so we need to remember that.”

“The last thing I want is for there to be a specific type of adversarial energy that causes our staff or the public to be in any type of unforeseen danger,” Deuben said. “The goal is to de-escalate as opposed to escalate.”

Deuben compared the current situation to COVID, when he strove to give his staff accurate information.

Of a potential visit from ICE agents, he said, “my goal is if they come in, they’re in and they’re out. “

1:55 p.m.: Attendance down in Portland schools as ICE enforcement ramps up

Attendance was down in Portland Public Schools Tuesday as immigration enforcement activities increased in the city and across the state this week.

The district’s overall attendance rate was down to 84.4% on Jan. 20, compared to 89.4% last Friday, a district spokesperson said, although she noted that the reasons for absences are not always clear from the data.

Portland is home to the state’s largest and most diverse school district, where nearly 30% of students are English language learners. The district already saw impacts on attendance early last week, when rumors of ICE’s arrival in Maine began to circulate.

1:50 p.m.: Homeland Security says heightened enforcement targeting ‘criminal illegal aliens’

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently enacted “Operation Catch of the Day,” a heightened immigration enforcement effort across Maine.

The federal agency said the operation is “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” according to an emailed statement from the Department of Homeland Security.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Federal officials would not immediately confirm how many people had been arrested by ICE agents so far, though they highlighted four people arrested in Maine Tuesday who are also accused of crimes such as aggravated assault and false imprisonment.

Fox News, during an interview with Department of Homeland Security Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde, said nearly 50 people had been arrested in Maine as part of ICE enforcement efforts.

1:35 p.m.: Portland schools pause off-campus lunches for students

Portland Public Schools is pausing its off-campus lunch option starting Wednesday to minimize “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions as they move around the city on their own to buy lunch,” the superintendent said in a Tuesday letter.

All of the district’s high schools will switch from an “open campus” lunch, allowing students to buy lunch off-campus, to a “closed campus,” beginning Jan. 21 and continuing indefinitely, Superintendent Ryan Scallon announced. The schools will stock extra school lunches, but also encourage students to pack their own.

He said for the time being, off-site educational programming, field trips, recess and extracurricular activities will continue as usual.

“We continue to expect that our schools will not be the focus of immigration enforcement, but if there is action that impacts a school, we will communicate with families and staff as soon as possible,” Scallon wrote.

ICE arrests ramped up in Maine’s largest city Wednesday; a mother of four was detained Wednesday morning after dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

1:30 p.m.: Pingree says federal agencies directed not to speak to members of Congress

Gabrielle Mannino, spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, said federal agencies have been under a directive not to speak to congressional offices since President Trump took office.

“Since early December, the USCIS asylum office with jurisdiction over Maine has forwarded all of our constituent and policy inquiries to USCIS Headquarters for response, which we have yet to receive answers to,” Mannino said.

“It’s interesting that (ICE) let the Fox news crew ride along with them, but they won’t talk to us. It’s been like this for the past year, not just with (current activities in Maine) … So, we’re kind of in the dark just like everyone else.”

Mannino said the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum office has not provided substantive responses to inquiries from Pingree’s office since the Trump administration issued the January 2025 asylum pause and country-specific adjudication bans.

“ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations continues to provide empty responses and will not provide any information to our office about a constituent’s location, well-being, or reason for arrest without a specific privacy waiver signed by the detained individual,” Mannino said.

“When we pointed out that access to detainees is often challenging and people are advised not to sign anything in detention, our office was told that we should consider collecting these privacy waivers proactively.”

1:20 p.m.: Portland’s Parkside residents alert neighbors to ICE’s presence

When residents of Portland’s Parkside neighborhood saw six ICE agents knocking at the door of a multi-unit residential building on Grant Street, they made some noise.

Citizens threw on jackets and ran to the sidewalk to blow whistles, alerting others that ICE was in the area. Other residents began honking their car horns, drawing more people out of their homes.

The agents left the building at 134 Grant when they did not get a response at the door. They did not detain anyone, and left in a black sedan, followed by several cars honking at them.

After the agents left the scene, a dozen people congregated at the corner of Grant and Mellen Street to talk about the encounter and other ICE operations in the area.

Wylliam Wold, who lives in the neighborhood, called the ICE activity hotline, which is coordinated by the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, to share the number of vehicles, the location and the uniforms the agents were wearing.

“I’ve been seeing flyers, talking with my community. I knew there was an ICE hotline and there’s an acronym, SALUTE, to remember what details to be giving when you do call it,” said Wold, 32.

“So that was just kind of my only thought: Here there’s nothing else I can do but call the hotline, share information.”

12:40 p.m.: Portland restaurant owner says her staff is anxious about ICE enforcement

Pastry Chef Ilma Lopez, who co-owns the Ugly Duckling and Chaval in Portland’s West End with her husband, said she has trained her staff how to handle any ICE presence at either restaurant.

“You can tell them, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m not allowed to talk to you. Let me just call our manager or let me just call our owner.’ You call me and I’ll take care of it.”

Lopez, who grew up in Venezuela, became an American citizen about a decade ago. “I’m 100% Latina and I’m proud of it,” she said. “I came to the States because in my country, it was really hard to make a living and we didn’t have freedom of speech. So 22 years ago, I came here and in a million years did it ever ever even cross my mind that we will be in this situation in America?”

Lopez said most of her restaurant staff come from North America, and all work in the U.S. legally. “We have done everything that the law asks us. I’ve been dealing with immigration lawyers for years. I follow every single step.”

She said the staff, nevertheless, is anxious. “Some people are anxious because they’re angry and upset. Some people are anxious because they don’t know what’s going to happen to them or to their friends. It’s a lot of question marks.”

11:25 a.m.: Gorham state representative says ICE officers are violating due process

Rep. Ellie Sato, D-Gorham, said the surge in immigration enforcement is harming Mainers who are skipping school, work and health appointments out of “fear of being disappeared.”

In a written statement, Sato, a member of the Legislature’s Judicial Committee, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are violating Mainers’ constitutional rights.

“What we are seeing on our newsfeeds everyday is a lack of due process,” Sato said. “It’s critical for everyone to know their rights, and how to respond when raids or arrests happen, both as bystanders, and as friends and family.”

Sato is sponsoring an emergency bill that would bar immigration enforcement officers from entering nonpublic areas within schools, public libraries, health care facilities and other locations without a judicial warrant signed by a judge.

11 a.m.: Lewiston resident reports ICE presence on Pierce Street

A migrant worker living on Pierce Street in Lewiston said ICE officers were present in their neighborhood Wednesday, with agents knocking on doors at nearby buildings Tuesday and again Wednesday morning.

The person, who asked not to be named because of safety concerns and declined to share their country of origin, said they saw a neighbor being questioned by agents.

“(Agents) were walking around here (Tuesday), and they caught him and interrogated him, but they didn’t take him away,” the resident said. “They didn’t take anyone.”

The resident said fears of ICE in their neighborhood and throughout the city are high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks.

“Even when they think you are here, you leave them alone,” they said. “Why are they here? We’re here to work, and we don’t hurt anyone.”

Portland city officials say they can’t restrict federal law enforcement from public spaces like city-operated parking garages, City Hall, Monument Square and Payson Park, according to an email from the parks department.

But when recreation programs are in session, officials say law enforcement officers cannot enter the space unless they’re invited or have a warrant.

“Many recreation programs, such as group swim lessons and Junior Celtics Basketball, take place in spaces that are reserved exclusively for pre-registered participants. During these programs, only enrolled participants and their caregivers are permitted in the program area,” according to an email sent by the parks department Tuesday morning.

City staff will inform anyone who tries to enter a recreation program area that space is limited to registered participants and caregivers, according to the email.

9:10 a.m.: South Portland school board cancels Thursday forum because of families’ fears

The South Portland board of education cancelled a public forum on Thursday to hear community members’ input about the upcoming budget because too many families with children in the schools were afraid to go out and attend, according to Board Chair Rosemarie De Angelis.

The school system has issued policies addressing what to do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents show up on school grounds. The policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and direct agents towards the main office if they enter school property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

9 a.m.: DHS begins ‘Operation Catch of the Day’ in Maine, reports more than 1,000 targets

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde said officers had identified more than 1,000 targets in Maine.

The network, which boasted “exclusive access,” reported nearly 50 arrests in Maine as enforcement picked up.

Officials have dubbed the surge “Operation Catch of the Day,” the network reported.

Hyde lamented a lack of cooperation by — and open criticism from — local leaders. City and state officials have warned of the impending surge for days.

“They ban their law enforcement from partnering or even communicating with ICE,” Hyde said on Fox. “And when law enforcement doesn’t communicate with law enforcement, that puts our communities in danger.”

Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana.
Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States.
Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family.","WASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials placed an asylum seeker who is eight months pregnant on a deportation flight Wednesday afternoon, even though she was in medical distress, her attorneys told States Newsroom.

ICE officials and the Department of Homeland Security responded to States Newsroom's requests for comment, but did not answer questions about the specific case.

Zharick Daniela Buitrago Ortiz, a 21-year-old national of Colombia, has a pending asylum case, said one of her attorneys, Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Buitrago Ortiz was also represented by the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center.

As an asylum seeker, she was going through the credible fear process, a key step to establish an immigrant’s claim for asylum if they can show a fear of persecution or torture in their home country. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.

Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Airport officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ahmed said flying late in pregnancy can have serious risks.

Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana. She was placed by ICE on a flight from there to Atlanta prior to her removal to Colombia, her attorneys said.

As she waited for the flight to Colombia, Buitrago Ortiz experienced intense, shooting pain in her back and abdomen, according to her attorneys. They said they were also concerned about the risk to her health and that of her unborn child if she was placed on the flight, which is roughly five hours nonstop.

ICE generally has a policy to not detain immigrants who are pregnant unless there are exceptional circumstances. Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about reports of ICE detainment of pregnant immigrants, and urged ICE acting Director Todd Lyons to order the release of any immigrants who were pregnant from ICE detention facilities.

Travel during pregnancy can be risky past 28 weeks and can increase the chances of going into labor, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States.

Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family. Her mother received a favorable credible fear interview, meaning an immigration official believed there was a possibility of harm if she returned to her home country.

The family arrived in El Paso, Texas, in early November, according to Buitrago Ortiz’s mother, who asked not to be named for fear of harming her own asylum case.

Additionally, Ahmed said the father of Buitrago Ortiz’s child was murdered earlier this month in Colombia.

“It’s important that we understand that there is a woman in medical distress,” Ahmed said. “The clock is ticking.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/atlantaairport2026.jpg?h=81485932&itok=baPcqhht,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:50.607891

Department of Homeland Security officials announced the latest enforcement operation Wednesday. Officials say they will be targeting what the administration considers “the worst of the worst.”

The agency said that the operation launched officially Tuesday and that 50 migrants who are allegedly in the United States illegally have been arrested.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a released statement.

The surge of ICE officers comes two weeks after clashes between federal immigration agents and protesters began in Minneapolis in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, issued a statement last week on social media, saying her administration had heard rumors of a looming immigration enforcement crackdown. Mills said her office had been unsuccessful in confirming whether an operation was pending.

Mills said she has directed the Maine State Police to work with local law enforcement as necessary as well as with city officials in Portland and Lewiston and the state attorney general.

“Our goal as always will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said in a video posted to her Facebook account.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said.

She added: “Maine will not be intimidated and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.”

ICE officers were dispatched to Minnesota in early December amid allegations of widespread fraud within the Somali population. DHS officials announced that 3,000 arrests of migrants in the country illegally have been made since that operation began.

DHS officials said Wednesday that among the 50 arrests made since Tuesday are migrants who have previously been convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Like in Minnesota, federal officials have alleged widespread fraud involving a Somali-led healthcare contractor that allegedly defrauded the state’s Medicaid system out of millions of dollars.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine Andrew Benson warned residents against interfering with the work of federal agents and officers.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” Benson said. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

He added, “Finally, it is incumbent upon anyone with a public voice—whether that be an elected official, commentator or engaged citizen—to similarly urge peaceful protest and engagement. Divisive, bombastic public statements only inflame the situation and make violence more likely.”

Maine is the latest Democratic-led area to be targeted by federal officials.

Mills’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although the Democrat said last week her administration was “taking proactive steps to prepare” for a possible surge in federal law enforcement agents.

Portland City Councilor Pious Ali said most of the people arrested by ICE on Tuesday were from Maine’s greater Portland area, including South Portland, Westbrook and Lewiston.

Local officials in the state have cautioned that the presence of federal officials in Maine could lead to heightened tensions, with Portland Mayor Mark Dion warning last week that “Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week.”

“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” Dion said in a statement. “Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also warned that the operation “may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” noting an increased presence of ICE agents in his city.

“ICE’s terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,” he said in a Wednesday statement. “These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News in Scarborough, Maine, on Tuesday that the operation was targeting approximately 1,400 individuals— including immigrants from Senegal, Somalia, Honduras, Guatemala and the Congo — and that authorities arrested more than 50 people during its first day.

The operation comes as ICE has deployed several thousand agents to Minnesota as part of an ongoing crackdown also tied — but not limited — to Somali Americans.

Local and state officials have repeatedly clashed with the White House over ICE’s presence in that state, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announcing Tuesday that he had been served a subpoena as part of a federal investigation into the Democrat. Vice President JD Vance is also set to visit Minneapolis on Thursday as protests continue across the city against the administration’s immigration crackdown.

ICE’s nationwide crackdown has at times turned violent in other states, including Oregon, where Border Patrol agents shot two people that DHS alleged were suspected associates of the gang Tren de Aragua earlier this month. Last week, a federal agent shot and injured another man who DHS accused of attempting to “resist and violently assault the officer” during a “targeted traffic stop.”

And on Wednesday, DHS said an agent had fired “defensive shots” against the target of an operation in Compton, California, but that the person — who was ultimately apprehended — “was not hit and attempted to flee on foot.”

Ali, a Ghanaian American who has served on Portland, Maine’s, city council, since 2016, said he feared the crackdown could harm local businesses and schools.

“This is just pure intimidation and fearmongering being unleashed in our community, and it’s going to impact not just the ones that they are looking for, but everyone else who is an immigrant, even those who are naturalized,” he told POLITICO on Wednesday.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ff4%2F40%2F5db70035461187e274a4420069e3%2Faptopix-immigration-enforcement-maine-39518.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:57:46.285842

The department said in a press release that it kicked off “Operation Catch of the Day” on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine’s political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement tactics were “not welcome.”

Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump has called the intense enforcement operations necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them “garbage” and saying they should leave the U.S.

Trump takes election-year crackdown to Maine

Mills, in her second term as Maine’s governor, is running for a U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Susan Collins, a moderate trying to fend off Democratic challengers in November’s midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Trump’s immigration policies are expected to be a prominent issue in Maine and other states.

Public support for Trump’s approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

Sheline said in an email that ICE’s “terror and intimidation tactics” showed “a complete lack of humanity.”

“Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home,” he said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine’s governor, calling her one of the state’s “sanctuary politicians” trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the incident was reported around 7:25 a.m. on the 2400 block of 126th Street in the unincorporated community of Willowbrook, which is located just north of Compton. Deputies with the LASD were not involved, but were called to secure the perimeter of the scene.

According to a DHS spokesperson, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Compton at 7:05 a.m. when the suspect made a ""dangerous attempt to evade arrest.""

The DHS claims the man, later identified as an El Salvadoran national, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, ""weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement."" At that point, an agent opened fire, the spokesperson said.

Carballo was not hit by any fired rounds and attempted to flee the scene on foot, according to the DHS. He was later apprehended and taken into custody.

At least one CBP officer was injured during the incident, although the extent and circumstances of the injury were not immediately made clear.

DHS claimed that Carballo was previously involved in a ""human smuggling operation,"" with two prior arrests for allegedly ""inflicting corporal injury"" on a spouse or cohabitant. He was removed from the U.S. by an immigration judge in 2019, DHS says.

Footage from the scene showed a silver BMW with a black hood that had sustained major damage to the front of the vehicle. The windshield was broken in multiple spots and the airbags had deployed, with a major law-enforcement presence in the area, including officers with CBP.

When asked for a statement, the office of Governor Gavin Newsom pushed back on DHS claims that ""sanctuary politicians, including Governor Newsom"" have instructed targets of immigration operations to evade arrest.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.""

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

When asked about the memo, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive - and seemingly unconstitutional - policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has shined a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Federal agents this month rammed the door of the Minneapolis home of a Liberian man with a deportation order from 2023, who was then arrested. Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

ICE officers often wait for hours for the person they’re hoping to arrest to come outside so they can make the arrest on the sidewalk or at the person's work — public places where they are allowed to operate without the risk of infringing on the person’s Fourth Amendment rights.

Whistleblower Aid called the new policy a “complete break from the law” and said it undercuts the “Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7933ecac-3da1-4fa5-8c5b-ef6eddf9b82f/wirestory_00d0ab0338e82341fd91b160758aeb2d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:34.986990

The effort is ""targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities,"" a press release from DHS shared Wednesday said.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary, said in a statement.

McLaughlin claims ICE agents arrested people convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child. NEWS CENTER Maine has not yet been able to independently confirm this, or if the people convicted served time for their crimes.

Governor Janet Mills responded in a statement, saying, “I recognize that many people across Maine are fearful in the wake of ICE’s announcement that it has launched an operation in Maine, and my Administration remains in close contact with municipal officials, including in Lewiston and Portland, as well as with organizations across Maine, to monitor ICE activity and ensure the safety and civil rights of people across Maine are protected. If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them. But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News the operation has resulted in about 50 arrests so far. Hyde said the agency is targeting about 1,400 individuals in Maine.

Hyde also criticized Maine’s law enforcement ban on collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it has hindered operations.

She told Fox News “agitators” in the state impeded enforcement actions, but added that the agency will continue until it has arrested all its targets.

DHS did not immediately provide additional details on the specific locations of arrests or the identities of those targeted.

Westbrook Mayor David Morse said in a social media post that ICE has been actively conducting operations and detaining people in Westbrook on Tuesday and Wednesday.

""At least one peaceful US citizen observer from Westbrook was targeted for intimidation by a masked federal law enforcement officer this morning,"" Morse said. ""This is outrageous behavior from a federal authority, and I stand by our citizens’ rights to peacefully observe and/or protest.""

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also released a statement Wednesday, saying Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare. These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,"" Sheline said. ""Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

Reports of increased ICE activity spread across southern Maine on Tuesday, prompting brief school lockouts and rising anxiety among immigrant communities.

Two Portland schools—Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School—briefly locked their doors around 9 a.m. after reports of ICE agents possibly on nearby Brighton Avenue. No threat was found, and the lockouts were quickly lifted, district officials said.

""This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,"" a statement from Portland Public Schools said. ""The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning. We will continue to provide updates directly to our PPS community as we have information to share.""

Elsewhere, Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis urged tribal members to carry tribal identification amid reports of federal detentions of Native Americans in other states. He said no ICE activity had been reported on tribal lands in Maine but cautioned members to stay informed.

""We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,"" Francis said in a statement. ""News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands.

Our immigrant neighbors make our communities stronger, and they are a critical part of what makes Maine the best place to live.”

What Employers Need to Know The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions.
Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are “similarly situated.” Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court’s holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are “similarly situated” based on a “modest factual showing” achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory “conditional” certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit’s Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit’s approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is “more likely than not” that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a “strong likelihood” that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the “more likely than not” standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of “more likely than not” or a “preponderance”. Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

Area, Officials Say","Jill Cowan, Orlando Mayorquín, Johnny Diaz, www.nytimes.com, jill-cowan, orlando-mayorquin, johnny-diaz",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/los-angeles-shooting-ice.html,"A federal agent fired his weapon during an immigration enforcement operation in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies.
Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.
She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents.
She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.","A federal agent fired his weapon during an immigration enforcement operation in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency said in an emailed statement that its agents were conducting an operation around 7 a.m. to arrest a man who they said had been “involved in a human smuggling operation.”

The department said that the man, Eduardo Moran Carballo, of El Salvador, had attempted “to evade arrest” and then “rammed law enforcement” with his vehicle. The agency said a federal agent had “fired defensive shots” and feared for his safety. It did not specify which Department of Homeland Security agency the officer worked for.

Mr. Carballo was not hit or injured in the shooting, the department said. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was injured, according to the Homeland Security Department, which did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries or state his condition. Agents took Mr. Carballo into custody.

The department said the operation took place in Compton, Calif., south of Los Angeles, but a local official said it happened in Willowbrook, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.

“This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,” the department said, adding that Mr. Carballo had two prior arrests on accusations of “inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.”

Hours after the incident, the wreckage of a gray BMW sports car that crashed was on the street near a curb, its airbags deployed and both doors open. Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies. Helicopters hovered overhead as protesters, shouting obscenities at the masked federal agents, began to arrive.

The Trump administration’s national immigration crackdown first ramped up in Southern California — and particularly in many of the heavily Latino suburbs of Los Angeles County — last summer.

Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.

Ms. Mitchell said that a Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement task force action led to a “vehicle pursuit,” which ended at around 7:30 a.m. in Willowbrook. She said she was told that one round was fired, and that no one was hit. The Sheriff’s Department helped to secure the scene, she said, but emphasized that county law enforcement officers were not involved in the immigration enforcement action.

Ms. Mitchell, whose vast district includes many neighborhoods where working-class Latino families have lived for generations, said that the episode on Wednesday appeared to have been carried out with “the same kind of recklessness and lack of regard for basic human rights and true public safety” that she has seen from federal agents for months.

The car chase on Wednesday, she said, took place during the morning rush hour, just as families were taking children to school. She added that the use of lethal force by agents, both in Los Angeles and in other cities, is troubling.

“Fortunately no one was killed,” she said. “It was by sheer luck — I assume they didn’t intend to miss when they fired their firearm, so we were blessed today.”

Ms. Mitchell urged constituents to continue to document any activity they see, if they can do so safely. She echoed officials in Minnesota who have said that such documentation of interactions between federal agents and members of the public could be important evidence in future court cases over the federal government’s tactics.

Rosa Enriquez, 39, who lives in nearby South Gate, was among dozens of people who gathered at the scene. She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents. She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.

“We’re in Compton,” she said. “We’re so used to living life being cautious, being careful, and this is what we fear the most.”

Mendoza, 17, ""was taken by ICE without warning, leaving his family shocked and terrified,"" the organizers of the fundraiser wrote.","While the federal Department of Homeland Security continues to withhold the identity of most of the 11 people arrested by ICE agents in Morristown on Jan. 11, the community has rallied to support at least two of them in a big way.

Online fundraisers have identified two of the residents arrested that Sunday morning along Speedwell Avenue —including a Morristown High School senior. Donors have raised $120,000 for their legal defense as they face deportation.

Adonay Mancia Rodriguez went to pick up a takeout food delivery at the front door of his apartment building when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leaving his 6-year-old daughter alone, a family friend said. The Honduran national came to the U.S. in 2013 and works in town as a chef, according to Cathleen Murphy, a Morristown teacher and neighbor of Mancia Rodriguez's family.

He remains in custody at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility, ICE records show.

""He came here as a refugee when he was 17 years old,"" said Murphy, who said she was ""acting as [the family's] advocate during this time.""

""He never received a follow-up mailing for his immigration process,"" she said. ""He has a case to get his green card and everything. He just didn't receive the mailing to go to court. So he never followed up with the process and then that's what led to the deportation order, we guess.""

When he told the ICE officials his daughter was upstairs, ""They said, 'We're not here for your daughter. We're here for you,'"" Murphy added. ""They did not send anybody to check on her or coordinate with local police or anything. They just took him to the car.""

The girl was in the apartment upstairs for about an hour until she realized something was wrong, Murphy said.

6-year-old left alone

""So she gathered up her things, her coat, her shoes and her tablet, and she went out on the street,"" she said. ""She waited for a woman who came walking up the street and she said, 'I don't know where my dad is.' The woman was able to use the tablet to contact the family. Her mother was working at Walmart at the time.""

""The little girl is absolutely traumatized,"" Murphy said.

Mancia Rodriguez's family has been allowed to visit him in detention, and an attorney is working on the case.

""We're waiting to hear this week if the judge will accept the motion to reopen his case to become a citizen. or a resident,"" Murphy said.

In a Jan. 15 response to emailed questions, three days after the raid, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the arrests of 11 ""illegal aliens, several with felony offenses"" in the Morristown operation.

Others ""took advantage of the Biden administration’s open border crisis,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said in the email.

The message did not identify the detainees nor provide details about the alleged offenses.

Online fundraisers

Murphy has cosponsored an online fundraiser for her neighbor's legal defense along with a family cousin of Mancia Rodriguez, Rosa Portillo. It had exceeded $26,000 as of late on Jan. 20.

""He first came to the country as a refugee and has been living and working in Morristown for over a decade,"" Portillo wrote.

""He is a hard worker with no criminal record whatsoever who is just trying to provide for his family. He has a huge family here that is devastated, but most of all is his daughter, who is inconsolable. They are very close and all she wants is to have him back.""

Another fundraiser has collected more than $94,000 for the legal defense of Juan David Mendoza, a Morristown High School senior who was among the detainees. Mendoza, 17, ""was taken by ICE without warning, leaving his family shocked and terrified,"" the organizers of the fundraiser wrote.

Organizers have yet to respond to messages from the Daily Record, but according to an update on the fundraising page, a district judge ordered the teen's release on Jan. 15 and he is currently represented by legal counsel. Efforts to reach the family were unsuccessful.

In a follow-up email from DHS on Jan. 20, McLaughlin said Mendoza was ""an illegal alien from Honduras"" who had entered the U.S. in 2024. ""He is an adult,"" McLaughlin added.

""All individuals are currently detained, and either in removal proceedings or in the process of being removed from the United States in accordance with U.S. immigration law,"" she said.

While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Advocates and Democratic elected officials rallied at the Million Dollar Staircase on Wednesday, demanding Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature pass bills that shield immigrant from federal enforcement. They want the state to refuse cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to offer legal aid to New Yorkers who are detained.

“We are here at a pivotal moment, a moment in time where our state and our country is at a crossroads,” said Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Do we want to continue being a democracy, or do we want to allow a fascist, authoritarian dictator to take us in a different direction?”

The coalition wants the governor to include $175 million in her Fiscal Year 2027 executive budget to pay for the legal services of immigrants facing deportation. That’s because, unlike in criminal court, people in civil immigration court aren’t guaranteed a lawyer.

That’s why lawmakers at the rally pushed for the Access to Representation Act. That bill, S141/A270, would establish the right to legal counsel for those making less than 200% of the federal poverty line—about $31,000 for a single person, $42,000 for a couple, and $64,000 for a family of four—when they’re involved in removal proceedings.

Proponents cited a statistic that immigrants with lawyers are up to two-and-a-half times likelier to win their cases. “Immigration court has as much due process as traffic court, it has been said, but with outcomes as grave as the death penalty,” said Catharine Grainge from the Jericho Road Community Health Center in Buffalo.

Grainge, an attorney, recounted a frantic 72-hour window where she drafted a 300-page motion to save a client from immediate deportation, a technical feat that probably would be impossible for unrepresented immigrants.

Proponents cited a New York City Comptroller report estimating that universal legal representation would put $8.4 billion in savings and revenue in the government’s coffers.

The coalition also rallied for the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act. The BUILD Act, S4538/A2689, would create a grant program to recruit and train lawyers, social workers, and community navigators to handle increasing immigration caseloads.

The BUILD Act would fund infrastructure in legal deserts, rural and remote regions where immigration services are historically scarce compared to the state average. While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer. The legislation is supposed to give attorneys more time to work on complex litigation.

Ralliers also promoted the New York for All Act, S2235A/A3506A, prohibiting state and local officers—including police and probation officers—from using tax dollars or resources to help immigration agents.

Supporters say ICE increasingly uses local police as deportation agents, eroding public trust by making New Yorkers afraid to report crimes, call for emergency services, or go to school. “We are not going to let you come into our communities to terrorize our neighborhoods, to divide our families, and to devastate our economies,” said State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, a Democrat from southern Brooklyn.

The coalition offered more statistics. Between January and July of 2025, they said, ICE detained almost 5,000 New Yorkers—more than in all of 2024 combined. As of August, almost 340,000 cases were pending in the state’s immigration courts. Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, described ICE detentions as kidnapping. She cited reports of 36 people dying in ICE custody in 2025.

They also highlighted the economic impacts of immigrants, who paid $31.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2023, while foreign-born residents account for more than a quarter of the workforce and include 190,800 entrepreneurs. “We’ve relied on that money that the immigrants bring every year to make our budget balanced,” Cruz said. “We need to make sure that we are not giving breadcrumbs to immigrants, because it’s frankly insulting.”

While anti-immigration voices maintain that cooperation with federal authorities is necessary to remove criminals and protect public safety, those at the rally disputed that connection between immigration and crime. Assemblymember Karines Reyes, a Democrat from the Bronx, said federal agents target law-abiding residents because they ran out of criminals on day one.

The governor and state legislature are supposed to finalize the state budget by the April 1 deadline, but the state has consistently missed that deadline in recent years.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2026/01/Immigration-rally-January-21-2026.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:07.440394

Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades.
That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.
“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing.
“It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate.","As a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill works its way through Congress, Congressman Marc Veasey, a Democrat who represents part of Dallas, introduced an amendment in committee Wednesday aimed to reduce the salary of James Rodden, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assistant chief counsel who acts as a prosecutor for ICE in immigration court in Dallas, to $1.

In February of last year, the Texas Observer reported that Rodden operates a white supremacist X account named GlomarResponder, based on an overwhelming number of biographical details that the Observer matched through publicly available documents, other social media activity, and courtroom observation. Three members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Veasey, wrote letters to ICE and DHS demanding information and investigation. In response, ICE sent a letter to Veasey stating it would address the matter and that such internal investigations can take up to 120 days, but it has otherwise not provided any information.

Veasey’s amendment came a week after the Observer reported that Rodden, who was apparently pulled from federal immigration court schedules following the Observer’s reporting last February, had returned to immigration court in Dallas.

“[Rodden’s] statements are disgusting, and they are dangerous, and regardless of if you are a Democrat or a Republican, they should be disqualifying for anyone entrusted with power in the United States government,” Veasey said during Wednesday’s House Rules Committee hearing. “If Congress does nothing, if the committee does nothing, then we’re sending the message that this type of behavior is tolerable, that accountability is optional, and that white supremacy can continue to be subsidized with taxpayer dollars.”

The GlomarResponder account has over 17,000 followers and has routinely posted hateful statements. In addition to posting that “America is a White nation,” that “‘Migrants’ are all criminals,” and that “All blacks are foreign to my people,” plus apparent praise of Adolf Hitler, the account has also made posts that evoke anti-immigrant violence: “Nobody is proposing feeding migrants into tree shredders,” the account posted in March 2024. “Yet. Give it a few more weeks at this level of invasion, and that will be the moderate position.”

Veasey’s amendment seeking to reduce Rodden’s salary relied upon the Holman Rule, which allows members of the U.S. House to amend appropriations legislation to cut specific programs or reduce the salary of specific federal employees. Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades. It was most recently reinstated in 2023 when Republicans retook the majority. That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.

“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing. “It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate. We can stand by Nazi sympathizers and Hitler supporters, or we can do the right thing and honor the sacrifices of the men and women who died to stop the hateful spread of Nazism.”

The lawsuit was one of many in which MLFA helps to defend AMP and its leaders against baseless claims. Judge Mark Scarsi agreed with AMP that “there are no factual allegations raising an inference that AMP was involved” in any conspiracy to harm Plaintiffs. Despite inflammatory allegations unrelated to the claims, AMP and its leaders continue to see the truth prevail.

MLFA is grateful to Ms. Christina Jump, who began her work on this lawsuit as the Civil Litigation Department Head in MLFA’s Legal Division, and continues to serve as lead counsel for AMP after entering private practice with Jump Start Legal Justice Center. MLFA remains dedicated to helping to represent AMP, with Staff Attorneys Samira Elhosary and Ali Boyd supporting Ms. Jump for the duration of this case. Thanks also go to AMP’s local counsel, Max Schoening of Qureshi Law, for all his help.

“We’re so excited to see AMP vindicated, yet again, from these baseless attacks. Though the lawsuits continue to get creative, we continue to rise to the occasion to protect AMP and allow it to continue its important work educating the US public about the just cause of Palestine.”

– Samira Elhosary, Civil Litigation Staff Attorney:

“I remain honored to lead litigation for AMP, both during my time at MLFA and now as Jump Start Legal Justice Center. Each time we have the opportunity for facts to rise over fear, the federal courts recognize the failures of the lawsuits against AMP. AMP and its officials work hard, and work honestly, and even the plaintiffs couldn’t point to a single fact where AMP committed a violation — as the Judge rightly observed that “there are no allegations that anyone from AMP was anywhere near” the events the plaintiffs claim caused them harm. They were not, and now they need not be anywhere near these plaintiffs’ baseless claims.”

By the time, by the time you turn around, you are surrounded by uh uh uh ICE agents and they are ready to take you with them.
And uh uh I also wanna add this.
""Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.
Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.","Uh, but this is an opportunity. Uh, for us, for us. To answer any questions and concerns you might want to express, now that ICE has engaged in their enforcement action, not only in the city of Portland, but it appears in the metro as well. So I want to respond to the fact that. Our communities feel anxious and fearful. They see this action as unpredictable and *** threat to their families. Collectively and individually, we've done everything we can to assure them and that. We believe in their right to be safe. And we've tried to direct resources their way to support their capacity to stay here in Portland. From hybrid education schools offering food sustenance. And just getting the rights and responsibilities out to all key parties so they know what to do should they engage *** federal officer. I want to underscore one important point. While we respect the law. We challenge the need for *** paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful. While we may dispute the basis for those laws as individual citizens. The fact remains it is federal law. What we've been concerned with as *** council is the enforcement tactics. That ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations. If they change the way they do their business, then we can focus on doing our responsibility as citizens and changing policy through our elected officials. So this council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, but we stand with them. As *** reminder. The Portland Police Department does not involve itself in the enforcement. Of civil Administrative violations under federal immigration statute. As police officers, if there is *** call. For support Having to do with imminent threat to life. or serious bodily injury, no matter who the agency or individual is, we will respond as we would to any one of you calling 911. That is our duty in terms of public safety. I'll interrupt for *** moment. Councilor Fornier, you can join us up here. Thank. So we, we've received *** lot of information from the public that, uh, enforcement contacts have occurred in the community, um, and that has come in the form of text or phone calls or shared videos, so we know they're there. um, I will remind the public, allow officers to do their work, do not obstruct. Uh, the best thing you can do is to be the best possible witness should the facts that come before you are needed by any future, uh, investigation or judicial inquiry. All right. If officers are acting with warrant, they are within the law. And this is not the place or the time to challenge that. I want everyone safe. Interrupting law enforcement action is *** risk conduct. It may feel appropriate in the moment, but it could lead to outcomes neither party wished upon each other when they began the transaction. So I want to make that clear. I also respect the right to dissent, to protest, to express your misgivings or rejection of current government policy. If all of you decide to do that, our police department has demonstrated an exemplary history in in. Protecting That expression Of constitutional right and we will continue to do so. Before I came out here, someone came in and said, if we did *** protest, we would be safe. And I assured him that the Portland Police Department would do its job, as it always has, impartially, professionally. The other concern we had about ICE arriving, and I put it this way, as *** former member of law enforcement. What Mayor Shalene and I expect is that federal agencies and their agents will conduct themselves in *** professional manner, respect the rule of law. And treat our citizens without the use of provocation. Exercise the restraint. That's necessary. These are standards that are not alien to anyone who carries *** badge. It's the standard we expect of our municipal police officers, and I hope and pray it's *** standard that the director of ICE would exercise against their agents. So With that, I'll open it up for questions. Mayor. Yes, are you aware that there are *** number of businesses in town that have put signs in their windows, uh, saying that ICE is not welcome? You. Want to talk about it. I want, I, I wanna allow, uh, Councilor. fellows here to address that because one of the businesses is in his district. Introduce yourself. Full name, spelling. Uh, I'm West Pelletier, W E S P E L L E T I E R. I'm the city councilor in District 2, which is that way. Um, I want to be really clear, this is *** war of terror that's being waged on our city by the federal government, um. We've seen, um, people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks. Um, and in response, people in Portland, business owners, um, Teachers, uh, college kids have formed *** network, um. To make sure that we have early warnings. And that we are able to get there in time to at the very least get *** name before someone disappears. Um, We have people delivering groceries to mothers that need diapers, but they're too afraid to leave because they know correctly that as soon as they leave, there's going to be 4 guys in the unmarked car outside their driveway that will throw them to the ground and take them, nobody really knows where. Um, While every single abduction that's happened. Is *** wound to Portland. Um, it's been very clear that Every single one has underlined just how important immigrants are to our community. They're the backbone of our economy, um. They are the kids that are getting on school buses. They are the families that go out to eat and, and make life what it is. And No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country. But because of, uh, you know, an agenda of white nationalism and, um, might makes right. Uh, we now have *** war on our streets. So, you know, what I would ask, I don't expect much from Senator Collins, from the administration, um, but I'd ask that the Democrats who are supposed to have our backs, grow *** little bit of *** spine. And do what *** random mother in any of our neighborhoods is willing to do and take action to abolish ICE. Uh, thanks. I can also answer questions. Do you have any sense, Mayor, of how many arrests have taken place in the last couple of days in the greater Portland area? I don't. I mean, If it was just based on videos I received, it'd be less than 6. I know ICE has, uh, declared there's been 50 in Maine. So it's an open question. And are you getting any communication from ISDHS anyone in the federal government on this? No, I mean, but that's *** consequence. Uh, in the years preceding this council being seated, our predecessors passed an ordinance that limits, uh, the cooperation of the foreign police as it applies to the enforcement immigration statutes from the federal level, so. If we're not cooperating, I think it's reasonable to anticipate they're not calling. And we're not calling them either because we're clear about what our mission is, is to protect the overall public safety, and they have *** very discreet narrow responsibility to enforce immigration law. What have you heard from the crowd? What is happening? How aggressive are they? What is the worst? I, I, I think I've heard narratives, um, from the ground that suggest real anxiety and fear just with their presence. Councillor Ellie. I'll turn to Councilor Ali. He's the mayor pro tem, and, uh, he does engage many of our diverse communities in the city for his opinion. Uh, thank you, Mayor. I Come again. Uh my name is Pius, P I O U S and my last name is Ali. And uh uh what I would say is that uh people on the ground are organized. I think one of my colleagues have said that earlier, uh people are afraid, they are scared, people's anxiety has have gone up because they don't know what to expect. Imagine you are *** parent and you step out to put your kid in *** school bus. By the time, by the time you turn around, you are surrounded by uh uh uh ICE agents and they are ready to take you with them. Who is going to take your child when they come back from school? So, because we don't want that to happen in our community, there have been *** lot of community groups coming together. We have created different channels where anything that somebody need, whether it is food or if they want their kids to be put in the school bus on their behalf, there are people on the ground that are going to do that. And uh uh I also wanna add this. I think if the federal government is looking for anyone in this country, so far as the person engaged the system. The federal government knows how to get that person. Without intimidation. Without unleashing terror on our streets. And I would say that we are here and we are willing to support our community as much as we can within the boundaries of the laws. And we are not going to be intimidated. By what is happening on the streets. Thank you. The Somali community in Minnesota has been *** focus of the ice enforcement happening there. Is that also true and important? Well, I don't know. But based on uh photos that were published uh by ICE, it seems the case that it's people of color, not necessarily from Somalia, and I'll discuss that in *** moment. Any other questions? What happens if ICE doesn't comply with the rules like you said they. Did you respond? Obviously this is something that we saw in Minneapolis where they're withholding investigative materials. Well, you can't decide how you're going to cross the bridge till you get there. Right, I, I, I think that's important. I don't like to, to speculate on what's gonna happen. As *** lawyer and as lawyers would agree, *** cause of action has to be established by conduct and speaking of conduct, I think Minneapolis was characterized by *** notable massing of federal agents entering *** neighborhood and I think the narrative of invasion arose from that. The perspective What I'm hearing from and I think and I talked with mayors today in other parts of the state we're seeing very individualized activity by ICE, *** person here, *** neighborhood there, um, their conduct at least. As it's current in Maine seems to be focused, which would indicate to me, and this is the speculation, is that they're functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant. So therefore they've identified *** party they have an address, they know who they're looking for specifically as opposed to this random show me your papers kind of experience. So by doing so, I don't think we're gonna see groupings of agents just patrolling the neighborhood. I think we're gonna get individualized reports from families like I, I received one. Uh, from *** mother saying that her son was arrested at *** grocer, uh, as he came out of work, and I've heard *** rumor that *** hospital saw some of their staff removed, um, but it seems like it's more specific. If that's the case, it appears that ICE may have evolved the way in which they want to engage the community for purposes of enforcement. And I, and I appreciate the US attorney's comments that he was paying attention to the situation and, uh, wanted for peaceful transactions by all parties. So we'll see. At the end of the day, we'll see. That's why it's important to document with your witness in the future there may be. Individuals, attorneys, or judicial processes that will need your information. Anything else? Go ahead. Do you have any message for business owners who are not just posting signs, but you know, are very fearful about, you know, carrying on doing new businesses, any reassurances the city can provide that they will be safe and can continue to do commerce? Well, we want them to do commerce. I mean, one of the meetings I participated with, uh, Representatives from the immigrant community, immigrant businesses in the chamber was to set up *** communications channel. We provided them with resources so they'd be clear about their rights and what steps they could take to protect, um. Their employees But it's hard because it's individualized if they're coming for one specific person that's gonna have *** different outcome on the business as opposed to saying you appear to have hired *** number of individuals who may have come from another country we're gonna line them up outside and check their papers. I don't think we're there, to be fair. I think we're in the individualized piece and just to reinforce about the signs in the window. I mean, last I checked, that is the First Amendment. All right. It may not have been perfectly expressed. It may have not taken the tone or language that some could appreciate, but I think. I can't speak to the operation of the mind of the owner of that business, but I think her intent was to. Display her rejection of adverse ICE activity, especially at her place of business. So and when we did talk at the chamber, we also talked about business continuity, what happens if the person doesn't come back quickly from from the detention and what the uh business could do. So we have been talking to *** lot of people on this issue. Yes, what message do you have to the federal government and the president at this time? I don't know if I'm gonna communicate to the president. I, I'm gonna communicate to the US attorney. Because he's made, we're made. And I think he has sent *** message that he has *** similar expectation that we do about how the federal government. Will behave as they conduct their lawful duties. I think if the president is to receive *** message, let him receive it from our senators and our congresspersons. That's their responsibility. That's their role, and I hope that that would have more impact than the Portland City council alone because I think our position is quite clear. In terms of Information I, I sent out. Who they arrested, right? Did you all get that with some mug shots? All right, let me do some homework with you. I was not afflicted with the idea of becoming *** lawyer, but I spent 32 years in law enforcement. So I actually read this. And I went to the photos. The first individual. It says um Mr. Ali is *** criminal illegal alien from Sudan convicted for false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice. And the violation of protection order. I think that's meant to frighten you. I think that's meant to infer that this criminal person was free in our com on our community, but you missed the word convicted. He's been convicted. He's been through the process. If so, has he served *** sentence? Is he considered now *** free person as far as the criminal justice? System is concerned. And that's one of the elite arrests now he might be in violation of *** civil infraction under the immigration code. That's your job to find out the next one. Ambassador Burney, *** criminal illegal alien. From Ethiopia convicted for aggravated assault and cocaine possession. Like convicted, what's the actual termination of that case? What's its posture? Did he become illegal as *** consequence of the conviction or did he enter this country lawfully, as many have, and that's always lost in the narrative. Elmara Correa, *** criminal illegal alien from Angola, previously arrested. For endangering, endangering the welfare of *** child. Was she found not guilty? Or are we just going to be satisfied that she was arrested? This is *** problem for the 4th estate. We are not members of your estate. That's your work. And last but not least. Because it appears that the assistant director. was indicting communities. Danny Lopez-Cortez, *** criminal illegal alien from Guatemala, convicted. For OUI. Right? Those were her 5 top picks to show you the state of crime and justice in in Maine. Oh I. It If we're going to talk about this issue, let's talk about facts. If we're gonna provide guidance, let us be calm, let us be leaders. If ICE has an issue with criminal aliens, let them actually be criminals. Right? And we can come to terms. Bye. I don't know. You're the judge of that. With the I didn't plan on taking the podium this long. From California. Thank you. I remember first name, last name, um, April Fournier, *** P R I L F O U R N I E R. Um, I'm one of our city's at-large councilors, um, and I apologize for my casual state of dress as I was out today in the community doing observing like we've asked so many of our community members to do, um, because one of the things that I know as an indigenous person, Um, as I have *** lot of friends and relatives in the Minnesota and Minneapolis area. And so what they have seen is detention of our very own indigenous community members. And so when we were notified that we would have ICE operations here in Portland, one of the most important things to me was to be out in the. Community with our neighbors with our relatives um watching and observing and really trying to reinforce with everyone because this is not day to day business for us is to to observe to show up for your community um to make sure that everyone understands that really immigrants are what make Portland just such an incredible place to be. And what we're not only going to see the social impact and what we all feel when these operations are happening in our neighborhoods, in front of our schools, in front of our grocery stores, is we're also going to see an economic impact. These are now families that will have potentially the primary breadwinner in their household have, has been disappeared. So how are they going to make rent? So we have the potential for. Increase of evictions. We're seeing impacts to our schools for all of these members who are teachers, who are students who are working in the cafeteria or working, um, as bus drivers. If they're not available, our schools are now short-handed. We're seeing that, you know, with businesses around the city, if these people are being disappeared, there's also *** gap. And so these are just such critical members of our community. Um, if we saw that this immigration enforcement was consistent, was following the law, uh, with this administration, I don't think any of us would have the level of anxiety that we're having right now. And so, um, again, I apologize that I am *** little casual today, but it's because I believe if you're going to be of the community, you need to be out in the community, um, and having eyes on. And so, as, uh, Councillor Ali mentioned, there are networks that have been set up for communities to stay in communication with each other to make sure they're checking out. Up on each other, observing, recording so that we have this information to be able to provide back to any of the legal entities if we do see that operations are not being carried out as they're supposed to be according to law. Um, but I'm so proud here to stand with this council and with our mayor and with all of our city staff and our school staff, um, and our school administration to continue to keep Portland operating and being the place that we know that it is, despite what's happening right in this moment. Thank you. I'd also call Councilor Sarah McNevitch, who represents probably the most diverse district in the city. Thank you, Mayor. Uh, that's, uh, Sarah McNevitch, District one, S *** R *** H M I C H N I E W I C Z. Um, as the mayor said, this is the most diverse district in the city and the state. Um, we have *** large immigrant population that continues to grow and thrive and bring value and vitality and economic benefit and, um, and Life to the city. Um, it's our responsibility to stand up for the communities that make our city what it is. Um, we have *** tremendous opportunity here to look out for them, um, to stand up, to record, to monitor what's going on lawfully, legally, um, As my colleagues have alluded to, uh, it's, it's, there are legitimate reasons for immigration enforcement. Um, it's the methods that are being employed and the broadcast approach that is so objectionable to so many. Um, there's, there's no legitimate purpose that's being pursued that cannot be achieved through due process. And I think that's the sticking point for *** lot of us. Um, I would encourage everyone to pay attention to what's going on around you, to look out for your neighbors, to know your rights, to know your responsibilities, and to know your resources, to know where to turn, uh, when you want to either report something or to share information or to assist other people, whether they be, you know, walking to school or just looking to have groceries to survive day to day in their homes. Um, That's, that's our strongest asset in Portland is our sense of community and our sense of pride. And our sense of knowing what is right. And that's what this council stands for. That's what I stand for. That's what the mayor stands for. And I know that's what the vast majority of our citizens stand for and what we will continue to support and continue to act on no matter what comes forward in the coming days. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor. Last but not least. Councilor Phillips. Uh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. Regina Phillips, R E G I N *** P H I L L I P S I represent district three. You know, as I sit here with my colleagues, uh, there isn't anything new that I can say to you other than, um, with this, you know, I don't know if there's warrants out there or, you know, whatever. All I know is what I hear is, is that some folks, um, are just being detained just because, right? We're very similar to Minnesota. They're just being detained because they are. My concern is with the children that are being left behind. We have, we have families that are, people, um, men and women, uh, um, mothers and fathers that are literally being dragged away from their children is what I hear. And, You know, if you have *** child, um, that is either in the grocery store or at home with *** parent, they don't know how to use *** cell phone. They don't know how to get in touch with their other parent. They don't know how to get in touch with *** relative. And as we know, ICE is not coordinating with anybody. They're not coordinating with our police department. They're not coordinating with the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure these children are safe. um, and so we have to mobilize because there are kids out there that are literally being dragged away from their parents. And that's the most concerning to me is what is actually happening to those children with their parents are being taken away literally at the gas station or the grocery store or at schools because they just don't have the means. And the ability to reach out to their relatives and say, hey, I'm stuck. I'm here by myself. And then where do they go? Where do they go? Because we know our foster care system is completely and utterly is overwhelmed. And so that's the concerning thing if you have *** warrant. If you want to detain somebody, like the mayor says, there's probably not much we can do about that, but do it in *** manner where children are not left by themselves. That's just cruel. Thank you, Councilor Superintendent. Chair. No, no, both of you. Listen, um One part that can be left behind is When *** city is going through this type of journey. And you, you heard it at the beginning of the conversations with Councilor Phillips. It's just not about what's occurring to the adults. The kids are there and the kids suffer along with us or celebrate along with us or made anxious because they don't understand what adults are actually trying to do. So one of the first persons that called me the morning that we knew ICE was in the city was Superintendent Scola. So, we protect our constituents, they protect our families, and the most important thing that we all agree on, our kids. So I'd I'd like to defer the podium to the chair, Sarah Lentz, and, uh, I'll stand with the councilor. So if you have any questions that are geared to families in the schools, they're here to respond to that, Madam Chair. Thank you. I'm Sarah Lentz, uh, S *** R *** H. Last name L E N T Z, and I'm chair of the board here in Portland. Um, I told, uh, *** reporter this morning *** story about my own child, who, when I picked him up from school, said to me, first off, he said, today my teacher told me there was ice on the playground and we needed to be careful. And I thought that there were people there to get me and my friends. That level of worry and anxiety is what all of our children are carrying as they go into the classroom. And we know that learning doesn't happen when kids are hungry, when they are scared, and when they don't feel safe. And what is happening in our community right now is making our community not feel safe. And that is not OK. As so many counselors have said today, there are other ways to do this. There are other ways that don't impact our kids and their families in the ways that they are feeling impacted right now. And I just want to say thank you to all of the community members, the individuals, and the organizations that are literally working around the clock right now to make sure that our kids have food in their house, that they can get to work or to the bus stop. That they can be connected to legal services and other resources that they need because they are fearful of coming out of their house. These are the impacts that we're seeing on *** daily basis. Our attendance rates are way down. Kids are not coming to school and their families are holding in their houses. So that's where we are. And that's where we're going to stay and we're going to hold the line and do whatever we can as educators and community members to make sure that our schools are safe and predictable spaces for everyone that are there. Yeah, at this point, are you aware of any students, staff, or family members of students who've been detained by ICE in the last few days? I can confirm that there have been people detained, but that's as much as I'm going to share. Can you give us the number? How, how much is attendance now and uh how? What, what percentage of the of the student population is uh minorities or immigrants? Yeah, so I'm happy to give *** little bit of background and then I'll ask the superintendent to give, um, uh, specific numbers on attendance. But in the Portland Public schools, we have 53% or 52% students of color in our district. About *** third of our students are multilingual learners. Um, and we also have about 500 students who are currently housing insecure. Um, so those are just some of the statistics of our, of our students, uh, right now, but I'm happy to turn it over to the superintendent who can talk more about attendance. Uh, good afternoon. Ryan Scallon, R Y *** N S C *** L L O N. Um, attendance varies significantly, um, as the impact is not even across our school community. So as Chair Lentz just shared, we are about 52, 53%, uh, students of color. Um, and we see *** range of attendance impacts. Um, our overall attendance is down more than 5% points, but we have some schools where the attendance drop is closer to 15 to 20%, uh, down. And so there's ***, there's *** wide range of how it's been impacting. Are there any measures being taken to make remote learning available? Any plans in the works to have entire schools go remote if need be? So, we know from the research coming out of COVID, as well as what we see happening in schools, that the safest, best place for students to learn for social reasons, for physical reasons, for academic reasons are in person. So as much as possible, we are planning to maintain in-person learning. The last two days I've been in our schools and I've seen that they continue to make sure that it's *** safe, welcoming place for all of our students. And so as much as possible, we want that to be. It would also not be prudent if we weren't planning for the range of contingencies. And so leadership in our district, including our school leaders, uh, have engaged and have done some planning around the potential for, uh, an online piece, but at this point, our intent is to remain in person. So I haven't heard anything about this, but just want to confirm with you, have you had any, um, any confirmed sightings of ICE agents on or near Cortland public school campuses? So, we have not had any sightings or reports of agents, um, on our, uh, property around schools. Uh, obviously, there is *** lot of information going on around, um, ICE action, and obviously, we are *** small city and with schools throughout the city.

I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE.""
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness.
Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried.","As congressional negotiators on Tuesday released a proposed spending bill for the US Department of Homeland Security, with the January 30 funding deadline rapidly approaching, critics of President Donald Trump's deadly immigration operations renewed calls for Democrats to oppose any new money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""You can't count on Dem leadership to do much, but you can for sure trust these warriors for democracy to hustle like hell to pass a bipartisan deal to fully fund the Gestapo currently attacking our cities, rather than using this one moment of leverage to try to stop them. Bravo!"" quipped progressive organizer Aaron Regunberg on social media.

Since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, congressional Democrats have faced mounting pressure to significantly rein in DHS and its agencies, including ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). While some progressive lawmakers have embraced such calls, neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has shown serious interest in using the appropriations process to that end.

Both Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) tried to frame the DHS bill released on Tuesday as taking ""several steps in the right direction,"" in the words of DeLauro, who also acknowledged that ""it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed.""

""I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE. I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE."" She specifically pointed to funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the US Coast Guard.

As a bill summary from Murray's office states, the legislation funds those and ""other critical programs Americans count on"" while cutting ""funding for CBP by $1.3 billion relative to fiscal year 2025, providing $18.3 billion in total.""

It also ""flat-funds ICE at $10 billion, preventing any growth to ICE's annual budget, and it cuts ICE's enforcement and removal budget,"" the document details. ""The bill provides $949 million (-15%) less in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations than House Republicans' and $708 million (-11%) less than Senate Republicans’ proposed bills—and $114 million less than the fiscal year 2025 level.""

Taking aim at the DHS secretary, Murray said in a statement that ""what we have seen from Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security is frankly sick and un-American. ICE is out-of-control, terrorizing people, including American citizens, and actively making our communities less safe.""

Sometimes, when members of Congress can't strike a deal before a funding deadline, they'll pass a continuing resolution that provides short-term funding to prevent a federal government shutdown and keep up negotiations. However, Murray suggested in a Tuesday statement that a CR is not a viable option because of the $75 billion for ICE included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed last July.

""ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,"" Murray said. ""The suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality: Under a CR and in a shutdown, this administration can do everything they are already doing—but without any of the critical guardrails and constraints imposed by a full-year funding bill.""

Murray also nodded to Republican control of Congress that the November midterms, arguing that ""the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need... ""If you believe that we should be putting more of our taxpayer dollars towards healthcare and that our immigration enforcement should be focused on actual criminals instead of tear-gassing American children, then we need to speak up again and again—and we must take our fight to the ballot box.""

Other Democrats in Congress swiftly rejected the proposal. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""

""I understand Democrats in these negotiations had a hard job—no new budget for DHS is going to cure all the rampant illegality happening within the department. But this bill doesn't put CBP agents back at the border where they belong and doesn't put checks on ICE’s out-of-control arrest and enforcement operations,"" he explained. ""Democrats have no obligation to support a bill that not only funds the dystopian scenes we are seeing in Minneapolis but will allow DHS to replicate that playbook of brutality in cities all over this country.""

The leadership of the nearly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus last week vowed to ""oppose all funding"" for US immigration enforcement in any upcoming appropriations bills without substantial reforms. CPC Chair Emerita Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) made her personal opposition to Tuesday's proposal clear, declaring that ""it simply does not meet the moment we face in this country with the lawlessness"" of ICE and CBP agents.

""We have seen ICE and DHS descending on cities across this country, racially profiling, and rounding up immigrants and US citizens alike—many of whom have committed no crimes,"" said Jayapal, an immigrant herself. ""We have watched in horror as they have dragged people out into the snow and as they have shot and killed US citizens. As they foment this terror and chaos on our streets, 37 people have died in ICE custody since Trump came back to office.""

""Meanwhile, across the country, over 70,000 people are being incarcerated in immigration jails run by private, for-profit prison contractors and being denied due process and bond hearings in Trump's mass detention effort that dozens of judges have said is not lawful,"" she stressed. ""All of this is dangerous—not just for immigrants but for every single American worried about the erosion of Constitutional rights.""

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness. I will be a strong no and help lead the opposition to it.""

The progressive group Indivisible has urged voters across the country ""to light a fire under Democrats to demand they use their leverage on the DHS appropriations bill to rein in ICE and deny the Trump regime one penny more for its mass deportation machine.""

""While most Republicans continue to rubber-stamp Trump's atrocities, some are becoming bolder in criticizing ICE's lawlessness and pattern of shredding constitutional protections,"" notes the group's webpage on reining in ICE. ""The louder we are and the more we organize our communities to take action, the harder it will be for Republicans to continue backing Trump's terror campaign.""

""Democrats need to stop whining about the limits of minority power and start fighting as hard as their constituents are to stop this regime’s mounting atrocities,"" the Indivisible page adds. ""We're not accepting excuses, and we will hold every member of Congress accountable who chooses complicity and cowardice over courage.""

Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried. Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch made that case Tuesday, writing that ""the lack of appetite for utterly dismantling the DHS regime—despite its culture of violence and disrespect for law-abiding refugees—reminds too many voters of the cowardice that branded the Dems as losers in the first place.""

""Dismantling the ICE regime needs to be the floor, not the ceiling"" he added, ""and any Democrat in Congress who doesn't get with the program can—and should—be replaced in the primaries to avoided another debacle with alienated or apathetic voters in November.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62907540&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:42.987639

No one was struck by gunfire in the shooting, reported at about 7:30 a.m. in the 2400 block of 126th Street, but federal authorities said a Customs and Border Patrol officer was injured. Details about the injury were not immediately available.

The Los Aneles County sheriff's Department said federal agents were conducting an operation in the area when there was a brief pursuit that ended in a crash. Video from NewsChopper4 showed a BMW with front-end damage and what appeared to be deployed air bags.

Shots were fired by a federal agent as officers were attempting to detain the target of the operation, authorities said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said DHS officers were conducting the targeted operation early Wednesday in nearby Compton to ""arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador."" The agency said William Eduardo Moran Carballo was part of a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.

An immigration judge issued a final order of removal from the United States in 2019, the DHS said. NBC4 Investigates is attempting to obtain more information about Carballo's criminal record.

""In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,"" the DHS spokesperson said. ""Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.

""These dangerous attempts to evade arrest have surged since sanctuary politicians, including Governor Newsom, have encouraged illegal aliens to evade arrest and provided guides advising illegal aliens how to recognize ICE, block entry, and defy arrest. Our officers are now facing a 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks. This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.""

The move by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a win to the Trump administration, which had vowed to appeal the lower court's order that restrained federal agents.

In her order last week, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez said agents appeared to have engaged in ""chilling conduct"" and ""intimidation tactics."" She noted actions such as the ""drawing and pointing of weapons,"" the ""use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions"" and ""actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

The appeals court decision comes as legal battles escalate between the Trump administration and local and state officials in Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross.

The Department of Justice on Jan. 20 delivered subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, among other Democratic officials, related to allegations that they impeded the work of federal agents. Walz and Frey called the move ""a partisan distraction"" and effort to ""intimidate local leaders.""

Meanwhile, Menendez is weighing whether to halt immigration operations after the state, Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating state rights.

JD Vance to visit Minneapolis amid protests, ICE raids

Vice President JD Vance will visit Minneapolis on Thursday, Jan. 22, a person familiar with his plans said Jan. 20.

Vance will hold a roundtable with community members and deliver remarks in the city where the Trump administration is fighting to continue its immigration operations.

Vance as been among the most ardent supporters of the agent who shot and killed Renee Good. He called the shooting ""a tragedy of her own making"" and alleged she was part of vast left-wing extremist network.

Statewide 'ICE out of Minneapolis' protest planned for Friday

Organizers in Minneapolis asked people to not go to work, skip school and refrain from buying anything as part of a protest against the ongoing immigration operations in the state.

""Faith leaders, business owners, workers, and concerned Minnesotans have called for a statewide day of public mourning and pause through 'No Work, No School and No Shopping' and a massive, peaceful march in downtown Minneapolis that afternoon,"" said a news release about the demonstration scheduled for Friday, Jan. 23.

In recent weeks, schools across the state have held walk-outs as protesters on the street have clashed with federal agents and recorded immigration enforcement operations.

Off-duty cops targeted by immigration agents in Minnesota: officials

Immigration agents have stopped off-duty officers in Minnesota ""solely because of the color of their skin,"" a group of local police chiefs alleged on Jan. 21.

Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley described an incident in which ICE agents blocked in an off-duty officer and demanded proof of citizenship. Bruley said agents knocked the officer's phone out of her hand when she tried to record the interaction and that the federal agents ""had their guns drawn.""

""I wish I could tell you this was an isolated incident,"" Bruley said, flanked by other heads of local law enforcement agencies. ""If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day. It has to stop.""

In a statement to USA TODAY, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""DHS is able to find no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning a police officer. Without a name, we cannot verify these claims. We will continue to look into these claims.""

Feds investigate protest at St. Paul church

The Department of Justice opened a probe into a protest that interrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

A group of protestors entered Cities Church on Jan. 18, alleging that Pastor David Easterwood serves as the ICE St. Paul Field Office acting director. Videos show dozens of protesters changing ""Renee Good,"" and ""don't shoot,"" as some verbally confronting churchgoers.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the DOJ is investigating the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits the use of force, threats or physical obstruction to block people from reproductive health care or access to religious worship under the First Amendment's right of religious freedom.

St. Paul Police Department Public Information Officer Nikki Muehlhausen told USA TODAY the department is actively investigating the protest as disorderly conduct. In a statement, Walz's office said the governor ""in no way supports interrupting a place of worship.""

What do we know so far about DOJ subpoenas

The subpoenas delivered by the FBI on Jan. 20 seek records and testimony related to an investigation into Democratic officials accused of impeding federal law enforcement, officials said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the subpoenas – sent to Walz, Frey and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison – will help build a case against the officials.

""When you have subpoenas out, it is not rocket science. Investigations are done by acquiring records, investigations are then furthered by putting witnesses in the grand jury and making a presentment for a case with our partners at the Department of Justice,"" Kash said in an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Those subpoenaed all criticized the investigation, calling it political theater. Ellison noted on X that the subpoenas came within days of him suing the Trump administration for the federal intervention in Minnesota.

""Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares to stand up to him,"" Ellison said.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations.","Vice President Vance is heading to Minnesota on Thursday, and he's not planning any peace offerings to Twin Cities officials and protesters opposed to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

Why it matters: Vance's planned events and speech underscore how the administration isn't backing down from its controversial raids and stops that resulted in the fatal shooting of protester Renee Good and damaged President Trump's poll numbers.

""JD took Minnesota on as an issue where he's going to lead. He wants a strong response,"" an adviser said. ""He doesn't want to back down. Neither does the president.""

Zoom in: Vance plans to hold a roundtable with community leaders, give an exclusive interview to the conservative outlet Newsmax and then conduct a news conference where he'll be flanked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Vance ""will point out how Minneapolis' sanctuary city policies have degraded public safety and endangered ICE officers. He will also celebrate the essential work ICE agents have done to take dangerous, criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,"" a White House official said.

Vance also is expected to emphasize the creation of a new Justice Department assistant attorney general position to oversee prosecuting large-scale fraud and abuse of taxpayer-funded programs.

Zoom out: The ostensible theme of Vance's visit is to emphasize the administration's ""unwavering support"" for ICE, but Trump advisers inside and outside the White House hope to continue shifting focus away from the unpopular enforcement actions and more toward prosecuting fraud.

For six years, the Minneapolis and St. Paul have been gripped by sprawling fraud cases, many surrounding the Somalian community.

Federal prosecutors and nonpartisan watchdogs warned for years that ""inadequate"" state oversight left several programs vulnerable to ""industrial scale"" waste and abuse.

After recent reports about fraud in his state, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz decided not to seek reelection.

Meanwhile, a grand jury investigating whether state officials have unlawfully interfered with ICE sent subpoenas Tuesday to the offices of Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties.

DOJ is also investigating the anti-ICE protestors who stormed a church while it was in service over the weekend.

DOJ blocked local police from investigating the ICE agent who shot Good but is investigating her widow, which prompted the protest resignations of six federal prosecutors who'd been handling the fraud cases.

Minnesota is ground zero for aggressive ICE law enforcement, replete with masked agents stopping people, asking for proof of citizenship and raiding homes.

""The mayor has been pursuing all channels with the goal of reducing tensions and violence in his community,"" a spokesman for Frey said.

Behind the scenes: Despite the escalations publicly, Trump's team has been in private communication with officials in Walz's government and major state-based businesses.

On Jan. 8, the day after Good was killed, Vance held a White House press briefing, defended the shooting as justified, tried to shame the news media for its coverage, announced a task force to investigate Somalian immigrant fraud and called on Walz to resign.

Vance and Walz have had a hostile relationship since 2024: They faced off at the vice presidential debate in 2024, when Walz was then-Vice President Harris' running mate.

Friction point: So far, the two sides can't find common ground because of their differences on immigration enforcement.

Trump administration officials want local police to help accompany them on immigration raids, which the federal government says are targeted.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations. They've decried ICE's tactics since the surge, pointing to reports of racial profiling and lawful residents being detained by federal agents.

Many local jurisdictions in the Twin Cities have policies prohibiting law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, but Walz's Department of Corrections says it notifies the agency of noncitizens in its custody and coordinates with ICE on their release.

“Wake up. Pay attention to what’s happening before it’s too late,” one man at the protest said.

ICE officials told NBC News in November that the warehouses would ""increase efficiency” in deportations and described them as “mega detention centers.”

Among protesters holding up signs and drivers honking in support, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. April McClain Delaney joined.

When asked if officials knew any details about the plans for the warehouse, Van Hollen said they don't know anything yet.

""We’re asking ICE for answers,"" Van Hollen said. ""In fact, just today, Senator Alsobrooks and Congresswoman Delaney and I sent the Secretary of Homeland Security a letter asking her about what their plans are [and] what are they planning here?""

When one man at the protest heard about the proposed warehouses for the first time, he said he ""threw up"" and the news made him feel nauseous.

One woman at the protest said she can't ""even stand the thought of having it in our county.""

""It is cruel. It is almost like concentration camps,"" she said. ""It’s like jail. I mean, they’re going to be in a warehouse. Can you imagine it? I can’t.”

By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run.","On January 7 in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross fired his gun four times into Renee Nicole Good’s car, killing the 37-year-old mother and United States citizen after she stopped to support her immigrant neighbors—who, since early December, have been in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s extreme deportation agenda. As with the murder of George Floyd, also in Minneapolis, video evidence has fueled nationwide outrage over Good’s killing, with more than eight in 10 U.S. voters reportedly having seen the footage.

The administration has thrown its full weight behind ICE, with Trump calling Good “very violent” and “very radical” and Vice President J.D. Vance calling her “brainwashed and a victim of left-wing ideology.” However, a majority of people in the United States disagree—and increasingly disapprove of Trump’s approach to immigration. In a poll released a week after Good’s killing, 53 percent think the shooting was not justified, and only 35 percent said it was.

In just its first year, the second Trump administration has provoked numerous explosive crises. It remains to be seen whether this tragedy will be more tinder for the pile—or the spark that ignites it all.

The latest tragedy in ICE’s long history of violence is speeding up crises already in motion.

Over the past year, ICE’s enforcement operations have been given the political green light to operate with no accountability. Since Trump returned to office, immigration agents have opened fire at least 17 times, killing four people and injuring another eight—though clear data is hard to come by. Video evidence from another shooting in Minneapolis, of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, also disputes ICE’s narrative of violent resistance.

For those in ICE custody, 2025 was the deadliest year in more than two decades, with 32 reported deaths—followed by at least four so far in just the first few weeks of 2026—and widespread allegations of torture. The recent death of Geraldo Lunas Campos at a Texas detention facility may be ruled a homicide, as a fellow detainee witnessed guards choking him. By repeatedly lying about these incidents, the administration’s already-minimal credibility continues to plummet—even among its own agents.

In response to ICE’s invasion, mass protests have erupted in Minneapolis and across the country, with a predictably violent reaction from federal agents. There were more than 1,000 events recently as part of the ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action. In response, federal agents—with Trump’s rubber stamp—have battered protesters and community monitoring groups, shooting less-lethal rounds at point-blank range, dragging a woman out of her car, and deploying tear gas from convoys (hospitalizing at least one infant). Last Friday, a district court judge ruled that federal agents in Operation Metro Surge may not use pepper spray or nonlethal projectiles against peaceful protesters, or stop vehicles without cause—a decision the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has placed the state’s National Guard on standby “to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies,” according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

For his part, Trump once again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act. He quickly walked it back but added, “If I needed it, I’d use it.” To bolster the threat, the Pentagon has made 1,500 U.S. Army troops ready for possible deployment to Minnesota. The 1807 law grants presidents broad authority to deploy federal troops for law enforcement purposes. Trump made the same threat during the 2020 protests after George Floyd’s murder and last year in response to protests against aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago. The Supreme Court’s recent decision limiting Trump’s ability to send the National Guard to Chicago may have also pushed Trump toward the Insurrection Act as a workaround to the Posse Comitatus Act, another law from the 1800s that generally prohibits the military from performing civilian law enforcement. Experts have been skeptical about the constitutionality of such deployments, but legal challenges take time; once boots are on the ground, the damage may already be done.

Channeling outrage and growing demands for accountability, states and localities (and people in the streets) are taking action to rein in ICE.

ICE was created after September 11, 2001, with few mechanisms for accountability, which have only been further weakened in the past year. By the end of 2025, the average number of people in immigration detention daily was 78 percent higher than the year prior. The Trump administration has systematically dismantled the federal watchdog responsible for civil rights violations at DHS and imposed new restrictions on congressional inspections of immigration detention facilities. Meanwhile, Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump’s cruel immigration agenda, assured ICE agents back in October—including questionable recruits with insufficient training—that they have “federal immunity.”

As the January 30 federal budget deadline looms and Congress prepares to fund DHS beyond its $170 billion windfall from last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some congressional Democrats are pushing for more accountability for ICE. Funding for DHS was absent from the House’s most recent spending package, with Democrats pushing for guardrails. Democrats from across the political spectrum are threatening to withhold votes unless the funding package includes basic accountability measures, such as mandatory identification, limiting Customs and Border Protection’s enforcement actions to the border, and mandating judicial warrants to arrest suspects in immigration cases. Congressional Democrats have also introduced a litany of bills to support ICE accountability, like the Federal Law Enforcement Standards and Accountability (FLESA) Act, the Qualified Immunity Abolition Act of 2026, the PUBLIC SAFETY Act, the Stop Body Camera Paywalls Act, and the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act—as well as articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. While these bills face long odds, they reflect mounting pressure on lawmakers to respond to public outrage over ICE violence.

A small number of Republicans have also signaled openness to minor restrictions, but ones largely focused on optics rather than structural reform. Party leadership remains committed to expanding ICE’s operational freedom, not constraining it. Failing to attach conditions to DHS funding would signal that many lawmakers are willing to legitimize ICE’s escalating use of force despite yet another episode of avoidable ICE violence.

With meaningful oversight—let alone accountability—from Congress unlikely, states and localities are moving to rein in ICE abuses. Along with the Minneapolis protesters’ lawsuit, Minnesota (along with the Twin Cities) and Illinois both filed federal lawsuits seeking injunctions to stop enforcement operations. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County moved to become the latest to institute “ICE-free zones,” which prohibit ICE from operating on county-owned property. New Jersey lawmakers also passed a package of bills to expand protections for immigrants, but outgoing Governor Phil Murphy vetoed it on his last day in office.

With the Trump administration unwilling to do so itself, the question remains whether states can hold immigration agents criminally or civilly accountable. Criminal prosecution faces steep barriers: state and local officials need access to evidence, yet the Department of Justice (DOJ) is both refusing to investigate Good’s killing and also actively blocking access to evidence—forcing Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty to plead for information from the public. Even if Ross is prosecuted, significant legal and evidentiary hurdles will likely constrain charging decisions and the likelihood of conviction.

Civil liability is also available but limited. Good’s family will likely pursue money damages from the federal government through the Federal Tort Claims Act or from Ross as an individual through a so-called “Bivens suit.” But both paths are narrow; federal tort claims are time-consuming and replete with procedural requirements, and the Supreme Court has made it harder in recent years to file Bivens suits against federal agents who violate the Constitution.

In December, Illinois passed a law allowing residents to sue immigration agents in state court for state or federal civil rights violations. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration quickly sued Illinois—and it remains unclear whether such laws violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. Regardless, states like New York and California are also moving ahead with such laws, with New York Governor Kathy Hochul prominently endorsing the legislation in her most recent State of the State address. And in the meantime, states like California, Illinois, and New York are continuing efforts to document ICE misconduct, whether for transparency alone, future litigation, or eventual prosecution.

Instead of responding to public concern, the Trump administration is closing ranks and escalating.

In a press conference hours after Jonathan Ross killed Renee Good, Secretary Noem suggested that Good was at fault for her own death, claiming she was engaged in “domestic terrorism.” While Trump has finally softened his tone, calling her death a tragedy, he initially said that Good was at fault for trying to “run over” the officer. A week later, the White House issued a press release claiming that mass deportations are responsible for lower housing costs, higher wages, and less crime. The administration’s staunch refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing by Ross or that ICE’s tactics have grown too extreme is fueling outrage from all corners—even from Tucker Carlson, who faulted Republicans for not acknowledging the tragedy of Good’s death. Trump could have easily lowered tensions by calling the killing an isolated incident and allowing a formal independent investigation to proceed. Instead, the administration is doubling down despite bleeding public support.

The administration is defending its immigration officers in two distinct ways. First, it insists that Ross was acting in self-defense. To prop up that narrative, officials have pushed out a series of stories claiming that Ross was injured during the incident, that he was dragged by a car in June, and that he is a war veteran with extensive military training. At the same time, the administration is also attempting to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist.” The DOJ abandoned its investigation of Ross to instead investigate Good’s wife over her work with a local ICE Watch group, leading six veteran DOJ prosecutors to quit in protest. Second, the administration is asserting that ICE officers have “absolute immunity”—with DHS itself tweeting at immigration officers and urging “decisive action should you be faced with an imminent threat.”

The president is also knowingly escalating the situation. Rather than attempt to calm tensions, Trump sent another 1,000 immigration officers to Minnesota, bringing the total to roughly 3,000. The administration is also ramping up a broader fight with the state, attempting to freeze funding for food stamps and sanctuary cities broadly. The DOJ is also reportedly investigating Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, Governor Walz, and Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey. Over all of this looms Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and the 1,500 Army troops on standby.

By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run. In the wake of Good’s killing, his approval rating on immigration hit a new low of 38 percent. The administration knows that the polling around ICE and immigration looks bad, but it may be taking solace in the fact that 77 percent of Republicans say Good’s shooting was justified. While igniting fear about crime and disorder is an age-old playbook that Trump has exploited for decades, early signs suggest that it may not work this time. Trump and Republicans will need independent voters in the midterms, but 59 percent believe the shooting was unjustified.

Whether Congress, the courts, or the states are willing to act on that public sentiment remains uncertain. But ICE’s tactics are eroding what little is left of the agency’s political and moral legitimacy.

Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.
“It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.” Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges.

In April, USDOT Sec. Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

In May, Wisconsin and 21 other states sued the federal agency, arguing transportation and immigration enforcement are unrelated and the Trump administration was attempting to “unlawfully usurp” congressional authority over spending. By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.

Congress provides more than $100 billion annually for state and local governments to maintain transportation infrastructure. Of that, approximately $1 billion goes to Wisconsin each year.

In November, U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled that the USDOT was violating the Constitution, writing, “Defendants have blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Initially, the USDOT appealed the ruling, but last week the agency dropped its appeal, allowing McConnell’s order to stand. It is now barred by the court order from withholding funding from state or local governments for failing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

“I’m glad that the Trump administration is seeking to put an end to its defense of this lawlessness,” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.”

Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges. The Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) similarly uses federal transportation grants to fund new bus purchases and maintain transit infrastructure. The county was recently awarded a $25 million grant by USDOT for road safety projects.

“It’s good news that the Trump administration will not be able to restrict local control through unnecessary conditions on USDOT grants. Milwaukee County has always followed all requirements on how state and federal grant funding is allocated and used throughout the community,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement to Urban Milwaukee. “My administration plans to continue this track record as we keep working to invest in public transit, safer streets, and transportation infrastructure and services to enhance the quality of life for working families across Milwaukee County.”

DEI programs also targeted

When Duffy and the USDOT tried to tie immigration to transportation funding, the agency also included language threatening to pull funding from governments with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. In the April letter transportation agencies, Duffy said their personnel policies cannot “discriminate based on prohibited categories.”",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0613-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 17:58:40.015873

Honduras has emerged as a key transit country for migrants, with thousands of people entering irregularly from Nicaragua on their journey northward.

A United Methodist clinic in Danlí embodies a faith-based response, offering medical care, dignity and accompaniment to migrants in extreme vulnerability.

The clinic is housed in a government-run migrant assistance center.

A Haitian mother of three said the health clinic and migration center have given her family “peace and hope” on their journey to find a better life.

For Marie Joseph and her family, a migrant assistance center and United Methodist clinic in Danlí provided a respite on a long and arduous journey.

“We arrived very tired,” said Joseph, 32, who asked that her real name not be used in this story. “We were scared and didn’t know what to expect. But here we were welcomed warmly. We were given food and a safe place to stay with my three children for two days.

“They also cared for us at the UMCOR clinic, where we were examined and helped with what we needed,” she said, referring to the health clinic, which is supported by the United Methodist Committee on Relief and the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries’ Global Health program. “It was a great relief because we were so exhausted from the journey.”

Joseph is making her way to the United States with her three children, fleeing the violence in her home country of Haiti, where gangs control large areas. She wants to reunite with family members in the U.S.

“I feel very grateful to everyone here at the clinic and the center,” she said. “When you flee violence and poverty, you don’t know whom to turn to for help. Here we were treated with respect and care, and that gives us hope to continue our journey. My children were able to rest and recover.”

Housed at the government-run Irregular Migrant Assistance Center or CAMI (Centro de Atención al Migrante Irregulares) in Danlí, the church-supported clinic provides free health care to migrants exhausted after crossing Nicaragua or eastern Honduras. The clinic was established by the United Methodist Mission in Honduras, led by Global Ministries and Bishop Rubén Saenz, the mission’s episcopal leader.

CAMI has become a connection point for those continuing on to Guatemala and Mexico. The health clinic offers rapid medical assessments, general care, basic medications and referrals to hospitals when needed, helping migrants continue their journey.

The center’s staff provide guidance to migrants on routes to follow and appropriate behaviors to avoid legal problems upon arriving in Honduras. Migrants are also granted a five-day temporary permit to complete their paperwork before continuing on to Guatemala.

Care guided by Social Principles

Wilmer Vasquez, coordinator of the United Methodist clinic, explained the procedures they have implemented, which allow each patient to receive an individual examination that includes diagnosis, treatment and a physical assessment.

“In situations requiring more specialized care, the patient is removed from the line and treated more thoroughly in the consultation room,” Vasquez said. “This ensures that the mass-care process, which requires a certain speed, is not disrupted by the detailed attention needed for more complex cases.”

Dr. Aurora Martínez, a member of the professional team at the clinic, described the most common ailments they encounter. “We frequently see cases of gastroenteritis, dehydration and various viral infections, which are typical given the hygiene and environmental conditions migrants face along their journey to reach this point.

“Additionally, when local hospitals are overwhelmed, we are called upon to screen patients here, helping prevent overloading the ambulatory population,” she added. This reflects the level of trust the United Methodist clinic has earned with regional health authorities and has brought recognition and gratitude from those who oversee CAMI.

One of the most effective procedures implemented by the United Methodist clinic has been the distribution of medical kits to the groups that regularly arrive at the center. Dr. Silvia Reyes coordinates this process and explained to UM News how the service works.

“The kits we distribute to migrant families consist of a medical package that includes pain relievers, fever medication, antihistamines and anti-inflammatories,” Reyes said. “They also include medicines for vomiting, nausea and stomach discomfort, which are the most common issues migrant families face on their journey.”

Vasquez emphasized that the work is guided by The United Methodist Church’s Social Principles relating to human dignity, care for migrants and health. “Our service philosophy is reflected in maintaining a steady, safe flow of patients without compromising the quality of care,” he said.

For Vasquez, these Social Principles form the theological and ethical foundation of the work carried out by the United Methodist clinic in Danlí. By affirming that every person, regardless of migration status, possesses sacred value and the right to dignified medical care, these principles support a ministry that integrates faith and justice.

New migration corridors

Although some recent data shows a decline in the immigrant population in the United States, migration has not stopped. The Pew Research Center reported that after reaching a record 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025, the number fell to 51.9 million in June — the first decline since the 1960s. Despite this decrease, migration flows to the United States remain steady and diverse. In recent years, regional transit dynamics have shifted, and new routes have emerged as significant migration corridors across the continent.

Official figures from Honduras’ National Institute of Migration indicate that 369,258 irregular — or unauthorized — migrants entered the country in 2024, with 97.2% crossing through unofficial points along the border with Nicaragua. These figures confirm that the vast majority of migrants used Nicaraguan territory as a transit route in their attempt to journey north.

“The center serves four to six buses daily full of migrants, the majority of whom are Haitians and Cubans, with occasional arrivals from Pakistan, China, Ecuador and Uzbekistan,” said Gustavo Ferrufino, officer at the Migrant Rights Office of the National Institute of Immigration in Honduras.

Ferrufino notes that in early 2025, migrant arrivals had decreased significantly due to changes in U.S. immigration policy under the new administration and the closure of the U.S.-Mexico border. However, transit has been increasing since the second half of last year.

“It may be related to changes in U.S. policy that have temporarily opened pathways or provided legalization for migrants,” he said. “We’ve heard from people passing through that they receive information from missions and diplomatic agencies in their home countries about new admission procedures, while others simply follow new entry routes at the border. They just try and stay in Mexico while waiting for their opportunity to cross.”

Leaving violence for a new life

At the migrant assistance center in Honduras, Marie Joseph shared her journey toward the United States. She lived five years in the Dominican Republic and is now fleeing both the violence in Haiti and the economic and social hardships she faced in the Dominican Republic.

“I am from Haiti. Life there was very difficult; there was violence, and we couldn’t live in peace,” she said. “That’s why we went to the Dominican Republic. I lived there for five years and learned Spanish so I could communicate, but the situation was also hard: unstable work, housing problems, and I felt I couldn’t give my children a secure future. So we decided to try to reach the United States to be with some of our family already living there.”

She described her journey as a long and dangerous one.

“We didn’t come directly from Haiti,” she said. “Many migrants like us first live in or pass through other Latin American countries. In our case, we went from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then began our journey north. Some migrants travel from countries like Brazil, Chile or Mexico; others take charter flights to countries such as Nicaragua, which has more flexible requirements, and from there cross Central America toward Mexico and the United States.”

Joseph and her family arrived in Honduras from Nicaragua. For them, Honduras is not a final destination but a transit country, where they seek support and rest before continuing their journey.

According to staff members at CAMI and the clinic, many migrants become stranded in Honduras without resources or documentation and rely on the humanitarian support provided.

“I want to sincerely thank everyone who helps us,” Joseph told some of the center’s staff. “Violence and poverty shouldn’t prevent children from having a future. Thanks to you, we have been able to continue our journey with a little more peace and hope.

“It’s a difficult path, but knowing there are places that support migrants gives us strength. I want my children to have a safer life and opportunities to study and grow without fear.

Those concerns have been sharpened by the January 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good, a queer 37-year-old Minneapolis mother and U.S. citizen who was fatally shot during a federal immigration enforcement operation.

Transgender people targeted early in Trump’s second term

Human rights leaders said the administration’s authoritarian trajectory has extended well beyond immigration enforcement to include the early and deliberate targeting of transgender people, an approach they described as both symbolic and strategic.

Jessica Stern, co-founder and co-president of the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, said attacks on transgender people have not been incidental but central to the administration’s political strategy from the outset. Stern previously served as the Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons under President Joe Biden.

“The weaponization of trans people’s lives has been baked into the very fabric of his political identity,” Stern said, pointing to Trump’s campaign spending aimed at stoking fear around transgender rights and his decision to sign an executive order targeting what his administration calls “gender ideology” on his first day back in office.

Trump issued an executive order on his first day back in office establishing that the U.S. government does not recognize transgender or nonbinary identities, and instead recognizes people only by their sex assigned at birth.

Stern said that timing mattered. In authoritarian systems, governments often begin by singling out a small, stigmatized population to test public tolerance for rights rollbacks and to normalize the idea that certain people can be excluded from legal and social protections.

By focusing so heavily on transgender people, particularly trans youth, service members, and those seeking medical care, the administration sent what Stern described as a broader signal: that communities already vulnerable to discrimination could be treated as political adversaries rather than rights-bearing individuals, even as institutions designed to protect civil rights are weakened or dismantled.

Amnesty: U.S. mirrors global patterns of democratic backsliding

Amanda Klasing, an Amnesty International USA official who moderated the briefing, said the scope and speed of the administration’s actions set Trump’s second term apart.

“We can say categorically that President Trump’s second term has been a human rights disaster at home and abroad,” Klasing said, citing executive actions that have shrunk civic space and undermined legal safeguards.

The organization warned that the United States now fits a familiar global pattern: governments consolidate power, discredit critics, punish protests, and weaken courts and oversight bodies until accountability becomes difficult to restore.

Immigration enforcement and civil liberties under strain

Immigration enforcement has emerged as a central proving ground for the tactics Amnesty warns are reshaping U.S. civil liberties.

At the press conference, Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, described the expansion of third-country deportations and aggressive enforcement actions as among the administration’s most severe abuses.

“In 2025, the United States is conducting enforced disappearances,” Widdersheim said, citing the transfer of migrants to detention facilities abroad despite documented risks of torture.

Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker who worked as a makeup artist and hair stylist, was sent along with more than 200 other men to CECOT, a torture prison in El Salvador, because the Trump administration declared him to be a member of a gang. Romero has no criminal record and denies being part of any gang. He was eventually freed from confinement and described physical and sexual abuse in an interview with The Advocate last fall.

Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said the immigration crackdown has driven record detention levels and deaths in custody while spilling into broader assaults on constitutional protections.

“The authoritarian playbook that I spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores,” Zeya said.

Good’s killing has intensified scrutiny of those tactics. She was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross during a federal enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, while witnesses, family members, and civil rights advocates have disputed that account and called for greater transparency and accountability. Video of the shooting, from several angles, calls into question the government’s assertions that Good targeted the agent. Protests following her death have linked the incident to concerns about the militarization of immigration enforcement and its spillover into routine civilian life.

“We have seen where this road leads when dissent is punished, oversight is dismantled, and people can be disappeared or expelled beyond the reach of the law,” Amnesty wrote in its report. “But we also know something else: the slide is not inevitable. There is still time to stop it.”

But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.","City property — including parking lots, public schools, parks and municipal buildings — is off limits to federal immigration officers conducting enforcement operations, under an executive order signed by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley Tuesday.

Smiley told reporters gathered at City Hall that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in other blue cities made the order necessary to protect the community. He said he was unaware of any ICE actions on city property since the second Trump administration took over one year ago. However, immigration officers entered the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security and prompting outrage from state leaders.

“We’re taking clear action to affirm Providence’s values,” Smiley said before signing his first executive order of the year with a black pen. “We do not want — and will not allow — Providence’s public property to be used to execute what we see as unlawful immigration enforcement.”

Smiley held up a copy of a red sign city employees will post noting the use of city property as a federal immigration enforcement staging site is now prohibited. In the event ICE officers are seen on any city-owned property without a judicial warrant, Smiley said Providence police will be required to vacate the federal agents from it.

“If Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents a valid judicial warrant, we will honor it,” the mayor said. “We honor it today, but the reality is that’s not what’s happening in most instances.”

Private property owners are welcome to go to the city’s website and download and print out the signs to identify “non-public areas of their property” where ICE activity is prohibited, according to Smiley’s executive order. Property owners can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith.”

Smiley said he has been encouraging the state’s judicial branch to enact a similar policy and also expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence to discourage additional ICE visits.

The Jan. 15 incident at the Garrahy Courthouse was the second time in three months that ICE officers entered a state courthouse. ICE officers briefly detained a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20, sparking condemnation from state and local officials, including Gov. Dan McKee and Chief Justice Paul Suttell.

ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Jan. 15 incident.

The Providence Journal reported “several” masked immigration officers ran through the first floor of the Garrahy Courthouse in pursuit of two young men though apparently did not take anyone into custody.

“Allowing these barely-trained and reckless federal agents to blunder through our state, disrupting the justice system and harassing children and judges, diminishes the safety of our citizens and undermines the efforts of real law enforcement officers,” Lt. Gov Sabina Matos said in a Jan. 16 statement. “I am glad that this incident appears to have ended without harm to anyone, but we have all seen how this behavior leads to tragedy. ICE needs to be reined in and subject to the same laws that govern us all.”

The Judiciary enacted rules for virtual court hearings in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recently posted its revised policy for requesting such a hearing using an online form. A judicial officer makes the final determination on whether the hearing must be held in person or not.

“As has been the case since the Judiciary developed remote hearing access capabilities, members of the public may request that a pending hearing be conducted remotely,” Judiciary spokesperson Lexi Kriss said in a recent email to Rhode Island Current. “These requests are to be submitted to and considered by the judicial officer presiding over the matter.”

Smiley’s order follows a move by city officials in November to amend Providence’s Community-Police Relations Act to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers.

Smiley acknowledged his order may put Providence further in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The president on Jan. 14 threatened to halt federal funding to so-called “sanctuary” cities and states starting Feb. 1 if they don’t honor his mass deportation policies.

But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.

The decision comes weeks after a similar operation in Minnesota incited protests and raised questions about the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thousands of officers and agents from the Department of Homeland Security were deployed there, and ICE’s actions have come under significant scrutiny in the wake of the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month by an ICE officer.

A number of asylum seekers from African countries ​who arrived in the United States during the Biden administration have settled in Maine​, joining a Somali population that started arriving there in the early 2000s​, when refugees from the country began settling in Lewiston. Yet Maine remains an overwhelmingly white state, with one of the oldest populations in the country. Some employers have begun looking to immigrants to fill labor gaps, as native-born employees have either left the work force or retired.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Maine telegraphed the upcoming operation in a statement on Monday advising people to protest peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the U.S. attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that an ICE official took the network on a ride-along in Maine, describing the operation as targeting people with criminal histories.

“We have approximately 1,400 targets here in Maine,” Patricia Hyde, the ICE deputy assistant director, told Fox News.

A D.H.S. spokesperson said the department did not comment on law enforcement operations.

The Trump administration has put pressure on ICE to ramp up arrests throughout the past year. At one point, White House officials proposed a goal of 3,000 arrests a day — a figure the agency has yet to hit. Despite that, ICE officials have ramped up enforcement across the United States.

Maine's governor opposes Trump's aggressive tactics

Support for Trump's immigration approach declines amid clashes

Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has started an immigration enforcement operation in Maine, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday, targeting a state that is home to several refugee communities, including Somalis.

The department said in a press release that it kicked off ""Operation Catch of the Day"" on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine's political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics were ""not welcome.""

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump says the intense enforcement operations are necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them ""garbage"" and saying they should leave the U.S.

TRUMP TAKES ELECTION-YEAR CRACKDOWN TO MAINE

Public support for Trump's approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over earlier this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolisfatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine's governor, calling her one of the state's ""sanctuary politicians"" trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

""We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maine will feature several competitive political races in November's midterm elections that will decide control of the U.S. Congress, and immigration is expected to be an issue.

Oppose the FY2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill

Congress’s fiscal year 2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is poised to further increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) already bloated budget, allowing ICE to continue expanding its detention capacity at a time when people are dying in the system at a record pace.

The current negotiated funding bill would provide billions of new tax dollars to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received last summer, when Congress passed President Trump’s reconciliation bill defunding Americans’ access to healthcare and food security, affordable housing, education, and other critical services in order to increase profits for prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, U.S. communities have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, including the violent arrest and detention of longtime residents, children, and U.S. citizens. Giving DHS even more money to abduct and hurt our neighbors will lead to irreversible harm.

Congress already handed DHS a windfall of $170 billion dollars to supersize its deportation force and detention apparatus. Thanks to this blank check, ICE says it already has enough money to detain over 100,000 people at a time and contract 80,000 new beds. 2025 was the deadliest year ever for people in ICE detention, and six people have died in ICE detention just this month. Local investigators are looking at at least one death as a “likely homicide” at the hands of detention guards. ICE and Border Patrol agents continue to terrorize our communities, leading to violence. Renee Nicole Good’s death is a stark warning of what might still be to come. The negotiated bill provides no guardrails to prevent federal agents from abducting and deporting people at historic levels.

We urge Congress to oppose any additional funds for ICE and Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Border Patrol, and to use this bill to rein in the Trump administration’s reckless abuse and assault on our communities under the guise of immigration enforcement.

Jesse Franzblau, associate policy director, National Immigrant Justice Center, said: “Congress should not provide another dime for the Trump administration’s violent assault on our communities across the country. We know that the deadly arrest and detention operations will only escalate as long as ICE and Border Patrol have a blank check to operate. Congress must stop taxpayer funds from going to the private contractors profiting from the deadly system, assert its authority by demanding real accountability, cutting funds for immigration prison camps and deportations, and investing in communities.”

Marisol Hernandez, senior advocacy manager, Detention Watch Network, said: “ICE kills — full stop. Decades of evidence illustrate that no one is safe in ICE custody. With a record number of people in detention and record number of deaths in ICE custody, including six deaths just this month, Trump’s cruel mass detention and deportation agenda is being executed at the expense of Americans receiving lifesaving healthcare and millions of kids having school lunches. We demand that Congress stop funding ICE, an abusive agency to its core. Now more than ever, we need real leaders who aren’t afraid to unite against Trump and advocate for the rights and dignity of everyone, including immigrants.”

Jamie Beran, CEO, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, said:“Congress cannot reward ICE for the horrific daily assaults, the murder of Renee Good, the shooting of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, and the deaths in custody with yet more money. More Americans are waking up to the reality that ICE does vastly more harm than good and it is time our elected officials join their constituents in that reality. As American Jews, we have seen before what happens when a government scapegoats and targets immigrants. We have seen the violence that results when government officials use the false, antisemitic and racist Great Replacement conspiracy theory to justify harassing, deporting, detaining, kidnaping, or targeting anyone who disagrees with them. Congress must intervene and stop the flood of funding to the agencies terrorizing our communities.”

Kate Voigt, senior policy counsel, American Civil Liberties Union, said: “In less than one month, six people died in ICE detention facilities while federal immigration agents have recklessly arrested and even killed members of our communities in the name of immigration enforcement – and these daily horrors are being funded with our taxpayer dollars. Our message to Congress is clear: rein in ICE.”

Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights, Amnesty International USA, said: “As ICE is terrorizing communities with brute force and warrantless arrests, and the Trump administration is expanding the cruel and deadly immigrant detention system with a total lack of accountability, it is shameful that Congress is playing business as usual and considering giving millions more taxpayer dollars to an agency with a documented track record of human rights abuses. Congress has an obligation to not fund human rights violations and should instead be cutting funds to ICE and creating guardrails against the agency’s lawless behavior. This bill is not the answer, Congress must vote no.”

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel, National Immigration Law Center (NILC), said:“After a year of lawless violence and intimidation at the hands of ICE and CBP, communities from coast to coast continue to show up for one another.

The local protest was also fueled by recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in York County.

Protesters across York County gathered on town squares and at busy street corners on the same day that 100 immigration enforcement vehicles were spotted in York City.

The precise actions being taken by U.S. Immigration and Customes Enforcement agents remained unclear Tuesday afternoon, as a spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Several unconfirmed reports of ICE actions emerged on social media, including one just across the county line in New Cumberland.

In all, nine ""Free America Walkout"" events were staged across the county on Tuesday, including in the town squares in Dover, Hanover, Red Lion and York. Several hundred were held nationwide on the anniversary of President Donald Trump's second inauguration. The movement called on people to withhold their labor to object to what organizers described as the ""escalating fascist threat.""

""This is not America. This is the greatest country on Earth, and we've turned to hell under Trump,"" said Marcy Glatfelter, of Hellam Township, as she stationed herself on Continental Square in York City.

Immigration raids, anti-LGBT rhetoric and attacks and mass surveillance were among the walkouts' focuses. Locally, protesters donned signs with messages such as ""Make America Trumpless again"" and ""Hands off our democracy.""

The Women's March, a feminist-led movement against oppression, mobilized walkouts in all 50 states and internationally. By interrupting the usual daily routine to publicly assemble, protesters at more than 800 demonstrations hoped to defend their freedoms and use collective outrage to spark action.

Anger only grew inside Glatfelter in the hours leading up to the protest. She brought multiple signs condemning the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

""They're rounding up York people today, right now,"" she said.

Less than four hours earlier, The York Dispatch captured video of more than a dozen black and gray law enforcement vehicles leaving the federal ICE facility along Clugston Road at a high rate of speed. Earlier in the morning, as many as 100 vehicles were reportedly staging there.

Glatfelter said that seeing the ramp-up in activity fired her up and made her feel scared for anyone those presumed-to-be ICE agents may encounter.

""They have no authority to pull people over, and they're pulling them over asking for papers,"" said Glatfelter. ""What is this, Berlin 1939?""

Later on Tuesday night, people spoke about ICE's presence during public comment at the York City Council's meeting. They expressed concern over the agency's increasing presence, and asked what the city is doing to protect its undocumented community and others who may be subject to profiling due to their skin color.

""I have seen the fear that it causes firsthand. There are people in our community afraid to leave their houses, afraid when they're going to work, afraid when they're picking their children up,"" said Alyssa Jackson, who works in York City.

Jackson told the council she felt a responsibility to her community to attend the meeting and ask questions.

Likewise, resident Jackeline Alvarez urged the council to swiftly address ICE's presence while upholding transparency, accountability and the safety of everyone in the city.

""How does the city make sure local police aren't participating in excessive force and that no one is targeted based on race, ethnicity, or national origin? How can residents safely report incidents if they occur? Will anyone answer?"" asked Alvarez.

She said the city needs to ensure that local resources aren't directed to federal ICE efforts, emphasizing that, in her view, the agency uses unnecessary force and violates rights.

After the meeting, Alvarez told The York Dispatch that she is extremely concerned about the 287(g) agreement West York borough entered into with ICE and wants to see the York City Council do something to reassure vulnerable populations that the city's police won't sign on to the partnership program.

""My concern — everyone's concern, really — is, who will be there for us if ICE racially profiles people here?"" Alvarez said.

Presently, York City does not cooperate with ICE in non-criminal matters. But efforts to legislate protections through a codified ordinance, dubbed the ""Trust Act,"" failed a year ago when then-Mayor Michael Helfrich vetoed the council's narrowly approved vote.

The ordinance would have enshrined protections for immigrants and refugees in the city, promising that police and other city employees would not ask anyone for their immigration status. Helfrich cited the financial burden — he estimated it at $2 million or more — the city would endure if the Trump administration moved to withhold funding from municipalities it deemed so-called ""sanctuary cities.""

Jackson told The York Dispatch that she was unaware about the Trust Act efforts but that she would be happy to see something like that enacted. She said she intends to keep speaking out until something changes.

""Obviously, everybody can see now that everything looks very scary,"" Jackson said.

At the demonstration, Katie Landis, of Red Lion, held up a sign reading, ""Do not comply in advance,"" an anti-fascist principle that she said is more important now than ever.

""I've been worried since the moment Trump got elected over 10 years ago,"" Landis said. ""All of the worries that I've had, I've been slowly watching come to fruition. The situation with ICE in Minnesota feels like a tipping point.""

Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was killed by an ICE agent earlier this month. She wasn’t herself a target of ICE officers. The incident ""terrified"" Landis, who was already concerned for the safety of immigrants and people of color in her community.

Following what happened in Minneapolis, Alvarez also expressed worry after the council meeting that law enforcement and onlookers could escalate peaceful protests locally. She asked the council to respond with a course of action within the next few weeks.

ICE's increasingly violent conduct under the second Trump administration alarmed Porter Hedge, of Spring Garden Township, and pushed him to participate in the York City walkout. He said ICE has strayed from decades-long protocols, no longer following immigration law and enforcement practices but rather exerting a ""disturbing"" abuse of power.

""They seem to be an untrained group of people hired for their capacity for violence,"" Hedge said. ""I fear for the people who have become targets of an undisciplined method of law enforcement.""

Protesting and causing disruption can slow the spread of fascism, if not stop it altogether, Landis said. She said most people blindly comply with the authority's rules, and that those who have the privilege to dissent should do so.

""All of our family members, all of our ancestors, came here to stolen land,"" said Eve Adler, of Springettsbury Township.

Adler said people don't understand what's really happening to immigrants in this country, so showing up and speaking out is crucial.

""I feel like (ICE) is just people who do not have the right to detain innocent people, and injure and murder innocent people, such as Renee, and all of the protestors of innocent immigrants who have come to make our communities a better place,"" Adler said.

Similar sentiments are why others, such as Hedge, want to attract attention from people across the country. He said he thinks it's necessary to avoid what he referred to as ""an un-American downfall.""

""It's gonna get personal very quickly for a lot of people,"" said Landis. ""I just wish more people would look at it, because if we don't look at it, how do we stop it? How do we fight against it?""

But not everyone protesting believed their individual or even collective presence would convince onlookers who might support ICE to see things differently. While most people driving by either honked in support of the protestors or made no acknowledgment at all, a few hecklers yelled profanities and praised Trump.

The invective didn't trouble Glatfelter, who encouraged people to take action — both in the form of protest and in communications with elected officials.

""If you care about your neighbors, call your congressman, call the Senate, call the White House. Write letters,"" she said.","https://www.yorkdispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/PPYD/88272609007-img-3773.jpeg?crop=3864,2178,x0,y404&width=3200&height=1804&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 15:58:19.646997

A federal complaint and affidavit filed in court by an F.B.I. agent differed in some details from the description provided by the Department of Homeland Security after the shooting last Wednesday. Two men, Alfredo A. Aljorna and Julio C. Sosa-Celis, who are Venezuelan nationals, were accused in the court records of assaulting the agent with a broom before the agent opened fire, striking Mr. Sosa-Celis.

Both men appeared on Wednesday in Federal District Court in St. Paul, where a judge found probable cause for the case to proceed. Neither man entered a plea or spoke about the incident.

The shooting happened a week after another immigration agent shot and killed Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, on a residential street in a different part of Minneapolis. Both shootings touched off protests in the city, which the Trump administration has flooded with immigration agents in recent weeks.

The newly unsealed court records provided the government’s fullest account yet of the second shooting, which an F.B.I. agent said happened after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a temporary assignment in the state ran a license plate on a Ford Focus and found that its Minnesota tag was registered to someone in the country illegally.

The two ICE agents believed that the driver, Mr. Aljorna, was the person who owned the vehicle, the F.B.I. agent wrote, but that turned out not to be the case. The affidavit said that the ICE agents, driving an unmarked vehicle, turned on their lights and siren to pull over the Ford. The F.B.I. agent said that Mr. Aljorna instead sped off and “recklessly zig-zagged through traffic” in a chase that lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.

The affidavit noted that the ICE agents “were not familiar with the area,” and said that they eventually lost track of Mr. Aljorna until discovering that he had crashed into a light pole. The agents said they then saw Mr. Aljorna run toward a nearby apartment building, and that one of the ICE agents chased after him. Another person, identified in the affidavit as Mr. Sosa-Celis, was standing on the porch and urged Mr. Aljorna to run faster, officials said.

The F.B.I. agent wrote that Mr. Aljorna eventually fell, and an agent caught up to him. The two then fought on the ground, the affidavit said, before Mr. Sosa-Celis grabbed a broomstick and started hitting the agent in the face. The affidavit said that the agent thought he saw another man, who was not named, approach holding a snow shovel, and that the agent was also struck with the shovel.

Mr. Aljorna eventually freed himself from the agent, the affidavit said, and grabbed the broom. The ICE agent, the affidavit said, was “exhausted, alone, on the ground and in fear.” The agent sustained a gash on his hand while deflecting a blow, the F.B.I. agent wrote.

The ICE agent drew his pistol and fired one round, the affidavit said, and was initially unsure if anyone had been hit. The two men had started to run toward the apartment building “simultaneously” when the agent fired, the affidavit said.

The two men went inside the building. After more law enforcement officers arrived, the affidavit said, they used tear gas and the men surrendered. Mr. Sosa-Celis was found to have “a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to his upper right thigh,” according to the affidavit.

Katherian Roe, the federal defender in Minnesota, who is listed in court records as the lawyer for both men, indicated in an email that she is often initially listed as the lawyer of record in cases that will later be assigned to another lawyer. She did not comment on the circumstances of this case.

The account of the incident relayed by the F.B.I. agent largely matched what federal officials said in the immediate aftermath, as protesters were gathering at the scene and clashing with law enforcement. But it also included notable differences from that initial description and from a more detailed statement released by the Department of Homeland Security the following day.

In earlier descriptions, federal officials said that the incident started with “a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela,” but did not mention that the driver the agents were trying to stop was not who they first believed him to be. Officials have said that Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are both from Venezuela and are both in the country illegally.

In its more detailed statement on the day after the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Mr. Sosa-Celis, not Mr. Aljorna, was the driver. The agency also used a different spelling of Mr. Aljorna’s last name. That statement accused a third man, also from Venezuela and also in the country illegally, of being involved in the incident. While the affidavit says that the agent believed a third man assaulted him with a shovel, only Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are accused by name in the complaint.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email on Tuesday night asking about those differences.

The F.B.I. agent’s affidavit said that investigators found a broom and snow shovel outside the apartment building. The affidavit also said that law enforcement officials decided to leave that building “without executing a full search warrant” because of “unprecedented civil unrest that developed in the vicinity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:37.822244

​“Data center construction accounted for 92% of growth in U.S. GDP this year,” Al-Haj noted.","Around the United States, the rebellions against President Donald Trump’s militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement invasions — bolstered by other agencies including the National Guard and, at least in one case, actual Marines—continue. National headlines have mostly skipped over Memphis, perhaps because it’s a smaller city in the South, far from the headquarters of national media. On the ground in Memphis, local policy organizer Amber Sherman explained, the fear— and resistance — are similar to what we see in bigger cities.

It’s not so much the National Guard, she said, but around the city, there are some 1,500 federal agents from the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force working alongside existing police and using traffic stops — reportedly more than 35,000 in two months — as a way to get their hands on people. This is the very issue — pretextual stops— that Memphis activists organized against so effectively after police killed artist and skateboarder Tyre Nichols two years ago. ​“It’s just scaring the hell out of people,” Sherman said. ​“A lot of people just aren’t going anywhere, and that’s really impacting all the economics. No one is going out to buy anything. People aren’t taking their kids to school.”

Unlike Illinois and California, Tennessee has a governor who is thrilled to have Trump’s troops. Gov. Bill Lee led the charge to overturn the police reforms that Memphis activists like Sherman had fought for, as I wrote in 2024. Cities under attack by the state government is a common story in the South, but the Memphis activists are also disappointed in their city government, which has offered to cooperate with the federal agents.

“We’re threatened constantly, and some people are susceptible to those threats,” Sherman said.

Activists in the city have fought for social services and youth programs that effectively lowered violent crime to a 25-year low— according to the police themselves. But too often the governor and state legislature overturn that work or its funding.

“Our mayor doesn’t want to push back because he knows that they’ll not fund or not give us grants for different programming,” Sherman said. ​“That’s how they keep us in check.”

What Memphis does have in common with most other cities on Trump’s list is Black leadership, a large Black population and powerful activist communities. And it’s beginning to fight back, too, against the tech takeover, embodied in Memphis in the form of Elon Musk’s xAI data center. So Trump sent in the task force — which had, between Oct. 1 and early December, made more than 3,100 arrests, and it won’t disclose who it has arrested or why. Local outlet MLK50 analyzed one day’s worth of arrest data to find that, despite the governor’s claims that the force is arresting violent criminals and gang members, ​“most of the people arrested were not charged with a violent crime, and immigrants are being arrested on administrative — not criminal — warrants.”

“It is meant,” Sherman said, ​“as a way to quell dissent.”

The rebellions have, so far, given us two iconic images of resistance. In Portland, Ore., we have the inflatable costumes—beginning with the frog and expanding to a whole menagerie. In Los Angeles, the indelible image is that of a string of automated Waymo taxis, put to the torch.

The costumes have quickly been seized on and replicated around the country, most visibly at the massive No Kings marches in October 2025. But as Julia Carrie Wong wrote in the Guardian, clowning in a frog suit is a de-escalatory tactic, designed to make masked agents of the state appear ridiculous.

By contrast, the flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences. If you’re going to treat our neighbors as disposable, the burned-to-a-crisp robotaxi says, we’re going to make you pay.

The flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences.

The Waymo is, after all, a privatized, automated taxi run as a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and rolled out in high-tech hubs like San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin, Texas.

Tech journalist Brian Merchant saw the husks of incinerated Waymos firsthand in Los Angeles and reported, ​“Protesters were reportedly calling them ​‘spy cars’ as they were vandalized and set ablaze, and some noted how the cars can share data with the LAPD.”

Merchant goes on: ​“ICE raids are carried out using data provided by Silicon Valley companies. … Whether directly or through third party contractors, much of big tech, including Google, has made deals with ICE, too.”

A Waymo car burns in the street as smoke billows during protests in Los Angeles, California, on June 8, 2025. Following a series of aggressive federal immigration operations in Los Angeles, tensions escalated when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a high-profile raid on a Home Depot location. The raid sparked widespread protests across the city, where demonstrators decried the targeting of immigrant communities and the separation of families. Clashes soon broke out between protesters and federal agents, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, a move harshly criticized by California officials, including the governor, as ""purposefully inflammatory."" (Photo by DAVID PASHAEE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)

A photo posted of one Waymo, presumably before it was put to the torch, showed it splashed with graffiti, ​“Eat the Rich” and ​“Tech Fuels Fascism.”

The same tech hubs in which Waymo has so proudly unfurled its service, after all, were also increasingly unlivable before the camouflaged gun-toting goons marched in, where homelessness is rampant and gig workers sleep in their (non-self-driving) cars.

Driving for one of the various rideshare and delivery apps was one way that working-class people, immigrant or otherwise, could maybe piece together a living; now, robotaxis and a horde of delivery robots cheerily automate their jobs away. The workers so recently called ​“essential” in the days of Covid-19 lockdowns are tossed aside or fed into the deportation machine.

Communities have been disintegrating under the weight of supposed prosperity. As Eric Garcetti, then-mayor of Los Angeles, famously said in 2020: ​“In a good economy, homelessness goes up.”

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be “workers” at all.

Wealthy residents and visitors to LA can cruise past homeless encampments in a driverless car, ignoring the people rendered surplus when parts of the servant economy are mechanized. California Gov. Gavin Newsom personally joined the clearance of one LA camp, ostentatiously shoving items into a trash bag.

The symbolism couldn’t be clearer: When we no longer value your labor, you will be discarded.

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be ​“workers” at all.

What happens when U.S. capitalism simply needs fewer humans?

The idea of people being superfluous isn’t new, but it’s become a dominant structure of feeling in recent years. Over and over, when I was reporting on the Covid pandemic, workers told me some version of, ​“They say we’re essential. What they really mean is we’re expendable.”

They felt this way in the middle of lockdown, when suddenly the importance of grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, line cooks and farmworkers was made abundantly clear. Immigrant-dominated industries were suddenly so important that the president demanded they keep working; meanwhile, undocumented people were excluded from most of the benefits offered to Americans to survive the crisis. Five years on, with the government shut down for some six weeks and SNAP benefits for more than 40 million people only recently restored, those suspicions of expendability have been proven correct, and not only about immigrant workers. Sherman noted that Tennessee has a rainy day fund of more than $2 billion, and it would have taken only a fraction of that to cover food aid for the 700,000 estimated residents of the state who rely on SNAP.

The United States has a long history of absorbing workers, particularly from Latin America, when demand is high, and removing them when demand falters. As I recently wrote for In These Times, ICE enforcement can be scarce in the months after a disaster, only to swoop in after cleanup.

But this story goes back further.

Famously, there was the Bracero Program, established in 1942, which brought guest workers from Mexico for the farming season, issuing millions of temporary visas. There was the also the overlapping, repugnantly named Operation Wetback, a crackdown by border agents to deport people back to Mexico or push them into the Bracero standards.

Guest workers were preferable because they could not stay — they were sent back as soon as the need for their labor was done.

This same reason is why Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have advocated for expanded guest worker programs in tech — cheaper workers are easier to remove if they make trouble. In low-paid farmwork, the excuse is that ​“Americans won’t do this work”; in tech, the argument is Americans lack the skills. Both arguments offer cover for the continued desire for cheap and easily controlled workers.

Since the end of the Bracero Program, the United States has tightened the border more. Presidents of both parties have targeted Mexican and Latinx immigrants, fast-tracked deportations, and, in Daniel Denvir’s words in All-American Nativism, ​“us[ed] undocumented workers as leverage.”

The result is the continued dehumanization of migrants — at best, valued as units of labor power rather than human beings, and, at worst, demonized for simply daring to exist in the United States.

Today, it seems, the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab approach to deportations might finally have changed the calculus. Beyond just keeping migrants super-exploitable to drive down wages for us all, ICE has become the shock troops of a regime led by a man who posts AI-generated slop of himself raining shit on the people he governs; they arrest and brutalize citizen and migrant alike, grab children on their way to school, terrorize people in their homes.

This is occurring at a time of skyrocketing inequality, when decent jobs and affordable housing are harder and harder to come by. White Americans, particularly men, who are used to being first in line for the good stuff, are now feeling the loss in status. Meanwhile, demagogues aplenty are telling them their loss has been immigrants’ gain. The reality is that the capitalists, in tech and other industries, care little for any of our lives: White workers, as well as immigrants, are disposable, and the investments being poured into so-called artificial intelligence are in the hope that more expensive workers — whether skilled coders held up so often as the ideal, or Hollywood writers, or journalists — can be replaced by an algorithm.

The gigification of so many jobs by the app-based economy (the Ubers and Lyfts) laid the groundwork. As Emily Bender, co-author of The AI Con, explained, ​“If the work can be broken down into little replicable units that people can slot into, then you don’t need to see workers as people with expertise, with careers, with relationships. They are just providers of content or annotations or labeling or, in big scare quotes, ​‘intelligence.’”

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal.

It’s Taylorism for the 21st century, and there is no industry that the tech overlords would not like to apply it to. Whether we are deskilled (and devalued), or literally packed off to prison or a deportation flight, capital will keep flowing into the pockets of the Zuckerbergs and Musks. (Musk, we should recall, is also rolling out supposedly self-driving taxis.)

Rooting for Trump to deport all the immigrants is a desperate bid to stave off one’s own expendability. The better solution, as striking Hollywood writers proved, is organization. Or, as the people of LA and Chicago and everywhere else remind us, to raise hell.

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal. As Merchant wrote, ​“The Waymo contributes to congestion, surveils neighborhoods, replaces the Uber or cab driver, and sends any resultant future profits upstream to a tech company in Mountain View.”

The protesters know exactly why — and for whom — it exists.

We are in a new age of uprising, as Joshua Clover wrote in Riot. Strike. Riot. These rebellions are often kicked off by state violence, spurred by a recognition of the racial dimension of this disposability. From Memphis, Minneapolis and Ferguson, Mo., to Los Angeles and Chicago, police murder a Black person and are granted impunity; ICE stuffs someone who looks Latinx into an unmarked van as community members film and shout and sometimes succeed in pulling their neighbors back. The forces of so-called order operate above the law, and more and more of us know it.

As Clover also stressed, the return of the riot comes as profitability and ​“economic growth” have stagnated. He noted that capital’s ​“tragic flaw” is that, in Marx’s own words, ​“it presses to reduce labor time to a minimum, while it posits labor time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth.” Capital needs us, even as it needs to replace us. It automates the labor, rendering more people surplus, even as it captures their skill in the machine and the algorithm — what Marx referred to so famously as ​“dead labor.”

So-called generative AI is a clearer illustration of this principle than Marx could have imagined. As Molly Crabapple and others wrote in an open letter, playing on his words, it is ​“vampirical, feasting on past generations of artwork even as it sucks the lifeblood from living artists.”

More prosaically: Machine learning sweeps up vast swaths of existing works of art, literature, journalism and scholarship, and vomits it back out in a fraction of the time it took to create the original, but mashed together, sometimes deliberately imitative. As we create and our work is made public, it is vacuumed up by the machine — a machine that requires ever more computing power, electricity and water. Trump uses AI to express his contempt for protests and, by doing so, expresses his contempt not just for the value of human labor but for the planet.

Meanwhile, people are rendered surplus along manufactured, racialized lines: the prison, the police killing, the migrant detention center, the deportation flight. Labor’s long-dear principle of last-hired, first-fired meant Black workers felt deindustrialization’s sting first and fiercest, though the stories we hear today nearly always figure the redundant worker as a white man. Factories moved overseas to wring greater profits from cheaper workers, and those left behind went into services, or gig work, or languished.

This cycle is familiar, and within it, the ICE raids — like the ar - rests of protesters with the movement to end the genocide in Gaza— work, as historian Robin D.G. Kelley told me, like a lynching: a public demonstration to instill fear and compliance. The ICE raid is a tool of discipline. And the bigger the surplus population, the more discipline needed.

Today’s rebellions have usually faced down the state, Clover noted, because ​“the state is near and the economy far.” The strike was the tactic of choice for the proletariat in the days of industrialized production because most people could reach out and touch the economy. But many cannot do so directly now because they are locked out entirely or their manager is an algorithm, an app, a ghost.

The riot is, as Clover argued, a struggle that ​“unfolds in the context of consumption, featuring the interruption of commercial circulation.” Protesters have, over and over, in the uprisings of recent years, taken to the streets, shut down transit, destroyed cars and looted shops, taking things because why do they deserve less than the rich? What Clover called the ​“surplus rebellion” mucks up circulation to be heard.

As humans are increasingly closed out of circulation, the targeting of tech makes more sense. As Brian Merchant noted, tech companies like automation ​“because it promises not just to remove labor from the equation, but accountability. There is no driver to blame if something goes wrong with the self-driving car, it’s a glitchy algorithm; or better yet, it was probably somebody else’s fault because Google’s algorithm is safe and sophisticated, even if it won’t tell you how that algorithm actually works.”

The protesters, though, turned that setup on its head: ​“There is no one around to stop them from hailing a Waymo car and destroying it.” The tech company has created a place where they can touch — and torch — what’s killing them.

The destruction of the Waymo also recalls an earlier period of transition, from the first round of riots to the strike. In the early days of industrialization, workers would smash the machine that replaced (or sped up and deskilled) their jobs. The Luddites were the most famous, and a series of books (by Gavin Mueller, Merchant himself, and Jathan Sadowski) have brought them back to public consciousness. The Luddites, far from opposing technology for its own sake, were well aware of who controlled the tech and how their labor was being encoded into it. Breaking the machine was not a symbolic action, but a direct one: The smashed machine can’t work, and the burned car doesn’t run.

“[M]achine-breaking,” Clover wrote, ​“is what the swing from riot to strike looks like.”

You may not be able to destroy the algorithm, but its avatar, roaming your streets, is still, necessarily, tangible.

AI is not produced out of nowhere. The Cloud is a bad metaphor. All of those searches we plug into ChatGPT or Midjourney are carried out on physical machines, and the mad rush to build more data centers means one of them is likely coming to a community near you.

In Memphis, there are no Waymos, but Elon Musk’s Colossus supercomputer has drawn the ire of many who are angry about its gas turbines and the pollution they bring to already-bad air. ​“They really weren’t ready for the level of pushback they would get,” Sherman said. The company is building another center and ​“they have all these private security guards that are everywhere” due to protests, she said.

Tech companies, said Sherman, seem to be ​“trying to get everything that they have wanted to do done right now because they have this president that’s supporting them.”

Just up the Mississippi, in St. Louis, local organizers are also fighting data centers. A project has been proposed for the middle of the city, at the Armory, a former entertainment venue located conveniently in a district that allows tax incentives and a lot of secrecy. They don’t know whose data center it will be just yet, said Jeremy Al-Haj, executive director of the Missouri Workers Center, but they know the city helped underwrite bonds for it.

The coalition — which includes organizations ranging from SEIU’s healthcare local to the Democratic Socialists of America to Metropolitan Congregations United and the Missouri Sierra Club — held a town hall and packed a local church with voices almost entirely in opposition. Their reasons, Al-Haj said, ​“ranged from the environmental concerns around the data center, water usage and electrical usage, the increased utility rates and the noise level from the data center,” as well as ​“just the very idea that this should be in the center of the city. And … outrage about AI and the automation of professional middle-class jobs and human creativity that implies.”

AI has proved a crappy replacement for humans — it’s not an accident that the common term for its digital output is ​“slop.” But it has contributed to the turning of decent jobs into lousy temporary gigs. In his book Work Without the Worker, Phil Jones noted, ​“AI does not tend to create fully automated systems but rather systems that partially automate jobs and outsource certain tasks to the crowd.” That crowd, he further pointed out, can be located anywhere that an internet connection can reach: automation and outsourcing continue to go hand in hand.

The Waymo car, Joanne McNeil pointed out, is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Remote contractors do the work that the algorithm and the robot can’t, but they’re hidden from view in what Astra Taylor called ​“fauxtomation.” Waymo’s co-CEO, McNeil noted, denied the cars have remote drivers, but this, she wrote, contradicted the company’s own filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, which ​“cited the remote workers in its automation chain as a critical safety feature.” Those workers can move the Waymo if the software fails; the company got its expansion approved because human involvement helps ​“minimize risk.”

Human workers compiled and cleaned the dataset that trained those workers in the first place — human drivers in Google Street View cars and humans behind computers deciding whether an object in a photo is a stop sign. Humans help train systems about which they know almost nothing; you’ve probably helped it yourself if you’ve ever had to use a reCAPTCHA to access a website. That data can be recycled, whether to train a Waymo or an armed drone. Bombing raids in Gaza were guided by AI; Memphis touts its new AI-powered surveillance hub.

Humans are present in every stage of the system, even as it renders them invisible, as Jones wrote. The AI is vampiric at first the way a mosquito is: a little nibble here and there. But mosquitos transmit viruses that kill.

The data centers are as distributed as the outsourced workers. In Mexico, communities battle the same pollution as Memphis, emitted by the same companies; electric grids falter under Microsoft and Amazon. Water shortages make people sick. The director of industrial development for Querétaro, where many of Mexico’s 110 data centers are, bragged in the New York Times of constructing data centers that would use the same amount of energy as 1.25 million U.S. homes. Meanwhile, the state plans to recycle sewage for drinking water.

This is the growth, domestically and internationally, that late capitalism offers. ​“Data center construction accounted for 92% of growth in U.S. GDP this year,” Al-Haj noted. ​“The New York Times just reported that Amazon’s planning to automate 75% of its workforce.” The Missouri Workers Center has been organizing with Amazon warehouse workers for several years, and those workers, he said, are worried: ​“And while they might create some small number of jobs for certain segments of the working class, for the remainder, they spell the loss of jobs.”

The algorithms and the robots are driven by humans, and their deployment is a human decision. The white supremacists who fear the so-called Great Replacement have their targets all wrong, in other words. The real great replacement they ought to worry about isn’t immigrants, but man (and woman, and everyone else) with machine.

In this economy, then, expect to see more machine-breaking.

Worker groups like the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and community organizations like Organized Communities Against Deportations have been building networks of communication, hosting know-your-rights trainings for migrants and concentric circles of activists who have documents, so they can join a rapid response or a more distant protest, amplify stories, serve as legal observers and more. Such groups, as I wrote in Necessary Trouble and From the Ashes, capture some of the outrage from moments of rebellion and build from it in strategically necessary directions.

In Memphis, Sherman said, as in many other cities, organizers have set up a rapid response hotline to report ICE or police activity. They’re canvassing and sharing information in multiple languages. She and others are organized under ​“Free the 901,” and their website offers know-your-rights flyers and information. ​“We post warnings about the different areas to avoid,” Sherman said. The group has also launched a rideshare program — the antithesis of the Waymo, a gesture of explicit human accompaniment — so people don’t have to brave the streets alone.

Organizers in Missouri have found they can indeed defeat the data centers. In St. Charles, community outrage seemed, to Jeremy Al-Haj, ​“pretty organic,” led by farmers who organized quickly. ​“It was also the case that the mayor’s cousin owned the plot of land that was going to get purchased, and the city council and the mayor had all signed nondisclosure agreements about the project.” Concerns about corruption, in other words, dovetailed with the anger at the secrecy and culminated in a yearlong construction ban.

Capturing the energy of a rebellion is like capturing lightning in a bottle. It doesn’t hold its form well. Not everyone is willing or able to come to weekly organizing meetings. That does not mean nothing has been learned in the streets, that knowledge-sharing isn’t taking place. During the LA rebellion, social media was overflowing with such sharing: Images from Hong Kong’s protests proliferated, and tips about tear gas were proffered by unlikely suspects, including one dermatologist who went viral.

In such moments, people learn the contours of their power. They learn how it feels to be part of a crowd, to have the scary thing happen and to stand up. In LA, successive generations of workers and organizers have survived police crackdowns and showed up again. Echoes of not just the 1992 LA riots or the 1965 Watts rebellion, but the 1990 police assault on a Justice for Janitors demonstration in Century City, could be seen in LA this summer.

David Huerta was one of those who cut his organizing teeth on the Justice for Janitors campaign. Now the president of SEIU California and of SEIU United Service Workers West, Huerta was arrested attempting to protect his community when the ICE raids began June 6. His arrest helped take the LA story national, as union leaders — even those less inclined than Huerta to put their bodies on the line — denounced his arrest.

The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

Since Huerta’s arrest, ICE has escalated to arresting Brad Lander, the third-highest elected official in New York City, and California Sen. Alex Padilla, among others. Huerta’s original felony charge has been downgraded, though he still faces trial.

The Watts rebellion, Kelley noted, ​“grew not from chaos but from a mobilized community seeking change.” There were civil rights groups but also arts collectives; after the uprising, activists created more cultural spaces and joined more radical political groups, including the Black Panther Party. They built a network to monitor police abuses.

Communities dispersed by policing, economic displacement, deportations — by all the tendrils of organized abandonment — have a harder time coming together, but history reminds us it’s not impossible. We are seeing in the streets what political theorist Rodrigo Nunes called ​“distributed action” in Neither Vertical Nor Horizontal, as different forms of organizing ​“combine, communicate, relate and establish positive and negative feedback loops with one another.” Such action operates at multiple scales and times; it involves the collectivities in the streets as well as the long-term membership organizations that stay when national reporters leave. There is little that is absolutely right or wrong: What matters is whether it works, not whether it proves prior ideas.

To those who ask what good setting a Waymo car on fire does, then, we might reply, ​“too early to tell.” But there is power when long-term organizing and battle-tested strategists come into contact with the righteous anger sparked by repression. The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

We know this means protecting people in our communities when the masked agents arrive, to the best of our abilities, and that requires getting to know those people ahead of time. We know the issues that will move people to act are the ones that, as Ruth Wilson Gilmore says, bite into their existence: the rent, the workplace, the police, the cost of groceries. Different organizations may focus on each, and when the flashpoints come, may be able to lead — or sometimes, importantly, to follow where the riot goes, and to learn in motion what it is that the people will no longer abide.

“We’re doing everything we can to keep our community safe,” Sherman said. ​“We want to make sure that we are answering the call of what people need in the moment.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/itt-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/5001w.F1Main.GettyImages-2219237857L.jpg?mtime=1767971869,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:27.512584

Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained.
Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration.
Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context.
As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration.","The First District Court of Appeal’s decision in Quilala v. Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. underscores the significant reach of the federal Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) in California employment disputes and the judiciary’s principal role in determining the availability of arbitration when sexual assault or harassment claims are alleged. In that case, Francisco Quilala sued his former employer, Securitas, asserting twenty-two causes of action arising from his employment, including claims for sex, gender, and sexual orientation harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). He alleged that supervisors questioned his sexual identity, asked intrusive questions about his sexual activity, spread rumors about his sexual orientation, repeatedly mocked him as “Mrs. Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained. When Securitas moved to compel arbitration under a predispute arbitration agreement signed during onboarding, the trial court denied the motion, concluding that the EFAA barred enforcement of the agreement, and Securitas filed an appeal.

The Court of Appeal held that trial judges possess an independent duty to determine whether a dispute falls within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration. In this instance, the trial court raised the EFAA on its own initiative in a tentative ruling, even though the plaintiff had not cited the statute in his opposition. The appellate court emphasized that since the EFAA expressly mandates its applicability be “determined by a court, rather than an arbitrator,” a judge is empowered to raise the issue regardless of whether it was briefed by the parties, provided that fundamental due process is respected.

The appellate court further clarified that the trial court satisfied due process by identifying the EFAA as a potential bar in its tentative ruling and granting the parties an opportunity to argue the matter at the subsequent hearing. Under this framework, there is no obligation for a court to solicit supplemental briefing before relying on the statute. Additionally, the court ruled that a plaintiff “elects” to proceed in court for purposes of the EFAA simply by filing a lawsuit and opposing a motion to compel arbitration. No formal or express invocation of the EFAA is required for a claimant to benefit from its protections, as the act of seeking relief in a judicial forum sufficiently demonstrates that choice.

Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context. Securitas argued that Quilala’s allegations did not rise to the level of actionable harassment, but the court, applying current FEHA standards, held that conduct altering the conditions of employment need only be “sufficiently pervasive” or “extremely serious” and must be evaluated in light of Government Code section 12923 and recent California Supreme Court authority. The court concluded that repeated derisive references to “Mrs. Quilala,” intrusive and humiliating questions about sexual activity, and adverse actions allegedly tied to perceived sexual orientation described more than “simple teasing” and plausibly alleged a hostile work environment. Because Quilala stated a cognizable sexual harassment claim under FEHA, the court held that the dispute qualified as a “sexual harassment dispute” within the meaning of the EFAA, rendering the predispute arbitration agreement unenforceable once the plaintiff elected to remain in court.

Finally, the Court of Appeal confirmed that once the EFAA applies, it does so at the level of the “case” rather than individual claims, and employers cannot salvage arbitration of non-harassment causes of action by attempting to carve them out. Relying on the statute’s use of the term “case,” and in line with prior California decisions such as Doe v. Second Street Corp., Liu v. Miniso Depot CA, Inc., and Casey v. Superior Court, the court held that the presence of a qualifying sexual harassment claim brings the entire lawsuit within the scope of the EFAA. As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration. For employers, Quilala serves as a timely reminder that even a single adequately pled sexual harassment claim can invalidate enforcement of an otherwise enforceable arbitration agreement for the entire action and that courts, not arbitrators, will be the ones to make that determination in the first instance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15036_5440.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:00:51.212941

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Violent scenes force a strong Democratic response

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It's chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-20T222655Z_369020490_RC285JA2I107_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:31.333257

A few days later, the violence ICE is perpetrating in our city arrived, literally, on our doorstep: Armed masked men raided our neighbors’ homes, remaining at our corner for two long hours. As we prayed and cared for those around us, several of our pastors and staff were among those who were pepper-bombed.

Our city is under siege, and when we asked the children in our congregation how they are feeling, they told us, unsurprisingly, that they feel scared. One youth, the child of an immigrant, texted his grandmother in the middle of the night: “I’m scared every day i live in fear and I don’t know what to do if your awake please call me.”

How can we comfort our children? We feel scared too.

We can start by acknowledging that we — unlike Renee Good, unlike George Floyd — have lived to breathe another day. For one more day, we have the privilege of following the way of Jesus, who called on us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked — and welcome the stranger.

And so, in this climate of fear, we turn to that life-affirming work. Immigrant families are afraid to venture outside. We’ve had to cancel our children’s choir practice until we can confidently gather the children safely.

Yet a few children and their moms still rallied to go grocery shopping for immigrant families, delivering boxes to a local McDonald’s where many immigrants work. In distributing Happy Meals to the appreciative children, the assistant manager offered a lesson in how mutual care strengthens the bonds of community. “When you share,” he explained in his accented English, “we share.”

We wish that feeding one another during these terrible times would be enough. But our young people tell us it is not. As one of our youth said, “I want to make sure my friends are not stolen from their families.” Another child asked, “Could you make ICE disappear? They hurt people.”

Jesus understood what it meant to live under an occupying force — in his case, the Roman Empire. He understood the helplessness. He understood the stakes, and yet he persisted in showing us, before ultimately dying from the violence, that another way — a way of love — is possible.

So we will continue to deliver groceries. We will make arrangements so that, if the unfathomable happens, the children can stay with other families. And from the epicenter of this occupation, we send out the children’s plea: Please. Make the people who are hurting people disappear.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN251208_223-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:30.435650

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents increasingly have staked out court hearings in the state to arrest people amid President Trump's mass deportation effort. A WBUR analysis previously found court arrests jumped threefold in January through October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

The legislation would require ICE agents obtain and show a judicial warrant to court personnel in order to take someone into custody at a courthouse for a civil immigration matter, such as overstaying a visa.

Federal agents often arrest people without a judicial warrant for civil infractions. If passed, this law would require a judicial warrant for officers to arrest someone on a civil matter on courthouse grounds in the state.

The proposed law also would ban anyone inside a courthouse from wearing a mask and require all law enforcement officers to identify themselves and state their purpose to court officials.

The East Boston senator said her bill protects access to justice by making sure no one is scared to go to court.

""When you don't feel safe to go to court — especially if you're a witness to a crime — that makes it harder for all of us to feel safe because how are we going to prosecute?"" she said.

What Temporary Protected Status is — and why it matters Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that Congress authorized to allow nationals of designated countries to remain and work legally in the United States when conditions in their home country make return unsafe.
In recent months, the administration has suspended or delayed asylum hearings, leaving Iranian asylum seekers in legal limbo.
The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive.
Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations.","Over the past several weeks, protests have once again erupted across Iran, driven by a deepening economic crisis and broader demands for political accountability. In response, the Trump administration has issued strong rhetorical support for Iranian protesters and sharply criticized Tehran’s heavy-handed repression. President Trump and senior officials have repeatedly framed the demonstrations as evidence of the regime’s illegitimacy and brutality toward its own people.

Yet there is a striking contradiction at the heart of the U.S. response. Even as the administration condemns Iran’s treatment of its citizens, it has suspended asylum hearings, maintained sweeping travel restrictions, and deported Iranian nationals from the United States. These actions undercut Washington’s professed concern for human rights and weaken the credibility of its support for protesters inside Iran.

If the United States wishes to align its policies with its rhetoric, it should take an immediate and concrete step: designate Iran for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and fully reinstate asylum procedures. Doing so would not only provide humanitarian relief to vulnerable individuals, but would also send a clear signal that U.S. support for human rights extends beyond words.

What Temporary Protected Status is — and why it matters

Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that Congress authorized to allow nationals of designated countries to remain and work legally in the United States when conditions in their home country make return unsafe. TPS is typically granted in response to armed conflict, natural disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions such as political instability and widespread repression.

TPS does not provide permanent residency, nor does it offer a pathway to citizenship. It is, by design, a limited and reversible measure, but it can be lifesaving. For individuals already in the United States, TPS offers protection from deportation, provides work authorization and the ability to live without fear while conditions in their home country remain dangerous.

The current situation in Iran clearly meets the threshold for TPS designation. Protesters have faced mass arrests, violent crackdowns, and internet shutdowns. This is occurring at a time when the Iranian economy is in freefall. Political dissent, whether expressed on the streets, online, or abroad, has been treated as a criminal offense, with protesters being called “enemies of God.” For Iranians who have participated in protests, expressed opposition to the regime, or are simply associated with diaspora activism, forced return carries significant risk.

The gap between rhetoric and policy

The Trump administration has framed itself as a defender of Iranian civil society, issuing direct language to condemn the regime. This rhetorical stance suggests an awareness that U.S. credibility on Iran depends on aligning itself with the Iranian people in this time of flux.

However, domestic immigration policy tells a different story. In recent months, the administration has suspended or delayed asylum hearings, leaving Iranian asylum seekers in legal limbo. It accelerated deportations of Iranian nationals last year. And it has kept longstanding travel bans and visa restrictions in place, reinforcing the perception that it views Iranians primarily as security threats rather than as individuals fleeing persecution.

Why TPS would strengthen US credibility

The administration has moved aggressively to terminate TPS designations for other countries, arguing that the program has been misused to provide indefinite relief rather than temporary protection. Iran presents a distinct case because the administration’s own characterization of the regime as uniquely brutal and unstable suggests that conditions genuinely are extraordinary and temporary — making Iran precisely the kind of situation TPS was designed for.

TPS would bolster American credibility in a number of ways.

First, it would offer immediate protection to Iranian nationals already in the United States who may face retaliation if forced to return. This includes students (who also should be considered for Special Student Relief), scholars, journalists, and family members who have been politically active or simply associated with opposition networks.

Second, TPS would demonstrate that U.S. concern for human rights is not selective or purely symbolic. Unlike sanctions or rhetorical condemnations, which often have indirect or ambiguous effects, TPS directly benefits individuals affected by repression. It is a tangible policy that aligns humanitarian principles with foreign-policy messaging.

Third, TPS would impose little cost on the United States. The Iranian-born population in the U.S. is relatively small, highly educated, and economically integrated. Allowing these individuals to remain and work legally would not strain public resources; in many cases, it would do the opposite by enabling continued participation in the labor market.

Reinstating asylum is equally essential

TPS alone is not sufficient. The administration should also reinstate full asylum processing for Iranian nationals. Asylum is a core commitment under both U.S. law and international refugee conventions. Suspending or delaying hearings during periods of heightened repression effectively denies protection to those most in need.

Importantly, asylum and TPS serve different functions. TPS provides blanket, temporary protection based on country conditions, while asylum offers individualized protection to those who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. Reinstating asylum procedures would ensure that Iranians with strong claims — such as political activists, religious minorities, or journalists — have access to durable legal protection.

Together, TPS and asylum would form a coherent humanitarian response: immediate protection for many, and long-term solutions for those facing the gravest risks.

Aligning values with action

At its core, the case for TPS for Iranian nationals is about credibility. The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive. Words of solidarity ring hollow when paired with policies that expose people to harm.

Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations. But they would represent a clear, humane, and achievable step toward aligning American actions with American values.",https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2615305755-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:34.389106

The trove appears to be the largest known breach of Department of Homeland Security staff data. It follows the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.

""It is a sign that people aren't happy within the U.S. government, clearly,"" ICE List founder Dominick Skinner told the Daily Beast.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials have condemned the ""doxing"" of agents and threatened to prosecute offenders.

The big picture: This form of strategic hacktivism has been more common overseas in recent years, particularly during uprisings, invasions and geopolitical conflicts.

Think of hackers taking sides in the war in Gaza, or Ukraine mobilizing local hackers at the start of Russia's invasion.

The intrigue: Sensitive data and surveillance have become central to the battle between ICE and those protesting its operations.

DHS directed much of its $75 billion cash infusion from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act toward new surveillance contracts, including those with Israeli spyware vendors and Palantir to track potential targets for deportation.

U.S. activists have increasingly weaponized leaked data and built counter-surveillance tools since 2020, when the Black Lives Matter protest hit a fever pitch, Cooper Quintin, security researcher and senior public interest technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Axios.

Zoom in: Hackers and digital activists have targeted the wide array of surveillance tools ICE uses in its mass deportation efforts.

Protesters have built tools to map Flock Safety cameras, flag Bluetooth signals from law enforcement surveillance devices, and report ICE raid locations.

One YouTuber found a flaw in Flock cameras that allowed anyone to access the internal interface controlling the live surveillance feed.

The Com, a loose-knit hacker community behind a wave of major data breaches, leaked the personal information of hundreds of DHS and ICE officials in October.

Flashback: These efforts are far more controlled, strategic and quiet than the U.S. is used to seeing from hacktivists, Quintin noted.

Anonymous, the hacking collective known for attacking major companies, governments and religious organizations, leaned on louder tactics — like boasting about its work on YouTube and Twitter — than today's digital protesters.

What to watch: The litigation threats to hackers and other activists chronicling ICE's actions online are very real.

ICE has been pushing courts to give it ""unlimited subpoena authority"" to force social media companies to identify people running anonymous accounts tracking and monitoring the agency's work.

Three women were indicted in September for allegedly following an ICE agent to their home, livestreaming the encounter, and posting the agent's home address on Instagram.",https://images.axios.com/DXq8aPf4mar_sCd5WDgfEiC12P0=/1366x768/smart/2020/04/10/222827-1586557707373.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 12:03:14.475991

Why it matters: Jeffries' opposition comes as Democrats both inside and outside of Congress are lining up against the bill, which they say isn't nearly sufficient to constrain ICE following the shooting of Renee Good.

At least five House Democrats spoke up against the bill in the Wednesday morning meeting, with none speaking for it, sources told Axios.

Swing-district Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), coming out of the gathering, told reporters he is a ""hell no.""

The progressive group MoveOn ""sent over 40,000 letters in just three days opposing any funding for ICE and Border Patrol until their lawless and dangerous behavior is reined in,"" spokesperson Britt Jacovich told Axios.

Driving the news: Jeffries told his members that Democratic leadership made five requests for ICE accountability measures and other related language that Republicans rejected, several sources told Axios.

As such, he said, he is opposed to the bill even as he supports the other appropriations bills the House is set to vote on separately this week.

Jeffries' speech came after Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas) all spoke against the bill in the meeting, according to sources.

Yes, but: Several battleground-district and centrist Democrats exited the caucus meeting saying they remained undecided on the bill.

That includes Reps. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), the battleground representative to leadership, and Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition.

""I'm going to continue to speak with my colleagues and speak to my team around it,"" Rep. John Mannion (D-N.Y.), a swing district member, told Axios.

Between the lines: Lawmakers are under considerable pressure from their grassroots to oppose the bill.

MoveOn urged its members on Tuesday and Wednesday to call their representatives and senators, urging them to oppose the bill, Jacovich said.

MoveOn and Indivisible are also organizing a ""pause on economic daily activities"" in Minnesota — such as school, work and shopping — calling for Congress not to fund ICE.

Said Mannion: ""The American people are demanding, certainly in my district, that there has to be something that resembles law enforcement in this country ... and this is not it.""

State of play: The DHS funding bill is set to be voted on this week, separately from a government spending package that funds the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation.

The DHS bill is likely to pass the House along party lines, though Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an arch-centrist who negotiated the DHS bill as ranking member of the relevant appropriations subcommittee, told Axios he is a ""yes"" on it.

The other government package, often referred to as a ""minibus,"" is expected to pass the House with bipartisan support.

The bottom line: ""If Democrats in Congress truly want to stop ICE in Minnesota and across the country,"" Jacovich said, ""here's their chance to do it.""

""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""","Democrats had planned to campaign in the midterm elections on affordability and health care, two issues where Americans are particularly unhappy with President Donald Trump. But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes ""defund the police"" rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. But those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there is mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations.

""We're Democrats. I'm sure we're going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,"" said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats. On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It's chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/0ee593e6-7d2b-425e-9b97-e69cb357d5f9/thumbnail/1200x630/ad13f972ca671ee67ef5318c936c7bf8/ice-mn-article-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:03:07.882364

At least six schools in and around South Seattle and Beacon Hill were under shelter-in-place protocols at one point Tuesday, according to Seattle Public Schools: Aki Kurose Middle School, Cleveland STEM High School, Maple Elementary, Mercer International Middle School, Dearborn Park International and Beacon Hill International.

It wasn’t clear whether ICE officers were actually in the area, and the district didn’t provide details about the initial reports that spurred the shelter-in place decisions.

“During shelter‑in‑place, students continue their regular class schedules but remain inside the building,” a district statement said. “Seattle Public Schools Safety and Security staff have been present throughout the day and have not observed any ICE presence. Staff remain on alert as a precaution.”

The district said “a shelter‑in‑place is a standard safety practice often used when there is any reported law enforcement activity nearby.”

While Seattle hasn’t seen a surge in immigration enforcement akin to that currently taking place in Minneapolis, the schools’ actions on Tuesday reflected just how high tensions are — and the effect even unconfirmed reports of ICE presence are having on the daily lives of students and their families.

Aki Kurose lifted its shelter-in-place at noon and Cleveland lifted it after lunch, according to the district. The others were expected to lift it at their dismissal times Tuesday afternoon.

The notifications sent to parents varied in their details: At Cleveland STEM High, Principal Jeff Lam told families in an email Tuesday that there were “credible reports of ICE activity in the community and possibly at other school campuses,” though not at Cleveland.

Maple Elementary School families received a message from principal Daisy Barragan saying a “nearby private school reported suspicious vehicle activity in the neighborhood,” but that there was “no activity directly involving Maple.”

Aki Kurose registrar Katie Jolgren said the middle school was notified by Seattle Public Schools that ICE agents may be trying to draw out families who were warned of ICE activity and were coming to school to pick up their children.

Jolgren said external doors were locked, and students were required to stay inside and couldn’t go to the field or playground. They could only leave if a family member came to pick them up, but it was business as usual inside.

Some parents picked up their children early out of caution, Jolgren said. Security support staff were expected to be watching over pickup and drop-off locations.

At pickup, Kate Reddy, who has a sixth grader and eighth grader at Aki Kurose, said she’d been at work when she got an email notification that the school was under a shelter-in-place order.

She said the incident was “very scary,” and made her think about ways Seattle families could be of help to others: For example, forming a network of community members who could offer carpools to kids whose parents are afraid of encountering ICE agents, she said.

That’s an effort already taking place in Minneapolis, where parents are organizing car rides and perimeter patrols to get students to class safely.

“The things we’re seeing on the news are going to happen here,” said Reddy, who lives in Columbia City. “It made me tear up.”

Parent Josh Apfel had been at home sick with his 13-year-old son when the teen got a text from a friend that Cleveland STEM High School was under a shelter-in-place order. Soon, he got another text from his 12-year-old confirming that Aki Kurose was under a shelter-in-place, too.

“I’ve been expecting things like this, so it’s not a surprise, you know?” Apfel, 53, said.

Apfel texted his child that they were safe inside the school, but that he could pick them up if they wanted. His child declined.

Apfel’s 13-year-old son texted his sibling that he was glad he was home sick from school that day, Apfel said.

SPS policy does not allow federal immigration authorities to access school buildings unless required by law, and says staff should not let immigration authorities into school buildings without consulting the district’s general counsel.

Metropolitan King County Councilmember Rhonda Lewis, whose district includes South Seattle, issued a statement praising the “quick thinking” of SPS.

“It’s a sad day in King County — or anywhere in America — when children and their families must live in fear of being abducted by their own government,” Lewis said. “I am deeply concerned about the ongoing impacts of this kind of activity in King County, especially in historically marginalized communities.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01202026_tzr_tzr_181826.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:51.590951

According to Fox News (whose reporters the agency brought with them into the area), ICE has already detained nearly 50 people. ICE is reportedly targeting about 1,400 people in the state that it says have criminal convictions.

Of the 50 people that ICE agents (many of whom were masked and all of whom were blurred out in the Fox News footage, which left detainees’ faces unblurred) it’s unclear how many of those people were on the list of people ICE says it’s in the state to target.

Regardless, it’s clear that ICE agents will be spreading fear throughout Maine cities and putting people at risk of detention, deportation, injury or even death. People in the targeted communities are working alongside allies at lower risk to protect and aid people impacted by ICE tactics. Here’s what you can do:

Regardless of who you are or where you’re from or your immigration status, if you think you might be at risk, make a safety plan

Immigration attorneys and community groups recommend that families make a plan before any encounter happens. That includes identifying trusted emergency contacts and memorizing their phone numbers, as well as ensuring children’s schools or day care providers know who is authorized to pick them up.

Parents are encouraged to provide written authorization allowing a trusted adult to make medical and legal decisions for their children if they are detained.

Whether you’re at risk or are an ally, know and defend your rights

If you are engaging with ICE agents in any context, you will probably be scared. But advocates stress the importance of staying calm. Do not run, argue, resist, or physically interfere with officers. You have the right to remain silent when ICE agents question you – but anything you say can later be used in immigration court.

If you’re stopped by someone who identifies as “police”, they may actually be an immigration officer. If this happens, you can ask the officer whether they’re from a local police department or from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection.

Keep your documents with you If you are a U.S. citizen or have documentation, you may show documentation such as a passport, green card, or work permit. If you do not have documentation, you do not have to answer questions about your immigration or citizenship status.

You don’t have to let ICE agents into your home If officers come to your home, you do not have to open the door unless they present a warrant signed by a judge. ICE administrative warrants — which are signed by ICE officers, not judges — do not give agents permission to enter a home without consent.

If you see ICE activity nearby, stay safe and record Move to a safe indoor space if you believe immigration officers are in the area. Mainers who feel safe may observe and document activity from a distance. You are allowed to video record ICE agents.

Report ICE activity If you see suspected ICE agents, you can contact the Maine ICE Watch Hotline at (207) 544-9989. Trained volunteers verify reports before sharing information with community members.

Try to remember the SALUTE acronym when reporting:

S: Size (How many agents?)

A: Actions (What are they doing?)

L: Location and direction

U: Uniform or clothing

T: Time and date

E: Equipment, including vehicles and license plates

An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.
We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations.","Immigration is one of the most divisive issues facing the United States, as it is in many countries. An ICE agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis is only the latest outrage that has brought the issue to the fore.

Facing a 30 January deadline to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, Democrats are now insisting on limits on ICE, at risk of another shutdown. It may be a pipe dream, but it is worth asking whether now might finally be a time to forge the long-elusive bipartisan agreement on immigration.

I believe deeply in the value of immigration – my father was an immigrant, as were my mother’s parents – but even I must admit that the current system needs fixing. Until recently, immigrants flooded the US-Mexican border. Rather than trying to sneak across as in years past, most presented themselves at a formal border crossing and sought asylum.

They proceeded entirely lawfully, but because their numbers overwhelmed the asylum system, it could take years for a claim to be considered, effectively allowing long-term residence in the United States before any ruling on the merits. That contributed to the perception that the asylum system was broken.

Joe Biden’s administration addressed the problem by maintaining the theoretical right to seek asylum but imposing restrictions, including making many migrants wait in Mexico where they were vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Donald Trump has essentially withdrawn the right to seek asylum at the border, denying people fleeing war and persecution the opportunity to find a safe haven.

So what is the solution? Given the prominence that Trump gave the issue during his campaign, it is safe to read his 2024 electoral victory as a mandate to tighten enforcement at the border. That could involve beefing up border patrols to deter people from sneaking in. It could even involve extending his notorious wall.

But rather than destroy the right to seek asylum, a more appropriate response would be to increase the number of immigration judges – a funding issue – so that claims could be heard fairly yet expeditiously. Cutting the backlog would greatly decrease the time that asylum seekers without valid claims stay in the country.

Trump’s deportation raids in neighborhoods and workplaces are far more controversial. Of the estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, at least two-thirds and possibly as many as 80% have been in the country for five or more years. About 45% have been in the country for 20 years or more.

The equities of deporting them are very different from deporting a recently arrived immigrant. The recent arrival has put down few if any roots. But immigrants who have been in the country for five or more years often will have US citizen spouses and children. They typically will hold jobs, pay taxes and have friends and relationships in the community. In short, the look like Americans in all but the papers they carry.

Advocates of tighter immigration enforcement justify deporting them by noting that they are in the country “illegally”. But that’s not the end of the matter.

If a person is accused of a crime, the criminal code contains a statute of limitations that, other than for the most serious conduct, bars prosecution unless charges are filed within five years of the alleged offense. Even most civil-law violations have a statute of limitations. That doctrine reflects in part the view that, even if someone’s conduct is illegal, they should be allowed at some stage to move on with their lives – that there is something unfair about upending their lives for something they did years ago.

A crime is more serious than merely entering or staying in the United States without authorization, but in this respect US law treats the issue more severely: there is no recognized statute of limitations for immigration violations. An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.

Some prior administrations have tacitly recognized this unfairness by focusing immigration enforcement on recent arrivals along the border – a policy rather than a legal solution. Trump’s raids in neighborhoods and workplaces across the country end that approach.

We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations. If immigrants have not committed a serious crime while in the United States, as few of those being deported by Trump have done, they should be allowed to stay if they have been in the country more than five years. Immigration opponents will undoubtedly howl that this is a dreaded “amnesty”, but it is no different from the statute of limitations that already exists in the criminal law, which hardly could be said to amnesty criminality.

Why would immigration opponents support this measure? Because it could be part of a grand bargain. In return for beefing up enforcement at the border and increasing the capacity of the asylum system to expedite rulings, we would recognize the unfairness of deporting people who have built lives in the United States.

That is the right thing to do. It would be a nod to reality, since the truth is that despite the high profile of Trump’s deportation raids, they are capturing only a tiny fraction of undocumented immigrants.

There would also be political advantages to both sides. Democrats would make clear that they do not stand for open borders, which are broadly unpopular. And Republicans could rid themselves of ICE conduct that is becoming toxic as Americans sour on the idea of summarily deporting their colleague at work or their neighbor down the street.

A grand bargain on immigration wouldn’t solve everything. It wouldn’t determine how many immigrants should be admitted as skilled workers, allowed family unification, resettled as refugees, or granted temporary protected status. But it could address a big part of what Americans have found wrong with the old approach to immigration and what they dislike about Trump’s new approach.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a2f16411ff10c24194387000942e2412a2fd06/362_0_2325_1860/master/2325.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=38db51791e51750475111a1fb8fda500",N,,2026-01-21 12:02:59.791697

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said.","Three hundred and sixty-five days after Donald Trump swore his oath of office and completed an extraordinary return to power, many historians, scholars and experts say his presidency has pushed American democracy to the brink – or beyond it.

In the first year of Trump’s second term, the democratically elected US president has moved with startling speed to consolidate authority: dismantling federal agencies, purging the civil service, firing independent watchdogs, sidelining Congress, challenging judicial rulings, deploying federal force in blue cities, stifling dissent, persecuting political enemies, targeting immigrants, scapegoating marginalized groups, ordering the capture of a foreign leader, leveraging the presidency for profit, trampling academic freedom and escalating attacks on the news media.

The scale and velocity of what he has been able to accomplish in just a year have stunned even longtime observers of authoritarian regimes, pushing the debate among academics and Americans from whether the world’s oldest continuous democracy is backsliding to whether it can still faithfully claim that distinction.

“In 2025, the United States ceased to be a full democracy in the way that Canada, Germany or even Argentina are democracies,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, the prominent Harvard political scientists and authors of How Democracies Die, and the University of Toronto professor Lucan Way, wrote in Foreign Affairs last month. They argued that the US under Trump had “descended into competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections are held but the ruling party abuses power to stifle dissent and tilt the playing field in its favor.

There is no universally accepted definition of democracy. Some argue the US is a “flawed” or “illiberal” democracy, or a democracy facing substantial “autocratization” – a process that began long before Trump came to power a decade ago but which his presidency has rapidly accelerated. Still, others believe the concerns are overblown, or reflect an intense partisan dislike of the current president.

Since Trump’s first term, scholars have warned that it can happen here. But many now say this moment is different – not only because Trump’s approach is more methodical and his desire for vengeance more pronounced, but because he now faces far fewer internal constraints.

The president’s Republican critics have mostly been driven from public office and those who remain say they fear retaliation for speaking out. Trump has repeatedly circumvented the GOP-controlled Congress, on spending, tariffs and war powers. And the US’s European allies are scrambling to respond to Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, by force if necessary. In an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Trump declared that the only constraint on his presidential power was “my own morality”.

Quantitive assessments of the country’s democratic health point are bleak.

Ratings of US democracy by scholars – and Americans overall – dropped “significantly” after Trump took office last year, according to data from Bright Line Watch, a non-partisan democracy-monitoring initiative that surveys political scientists and the public on potential threats and erosions. In its September survey, experts rated US democracy 54 on a 100-point scale, placing the country closer to illiberal or hybrid regimes than to the full democracies of G7 peers such as Canada or the United Kingdom.

An assessment by the Century Foundation’s new democracy indexing project found that the US had recorded a staggering 28% “collapse” in democratic health over the past year – from 79/100 in 2024 to 57/100 in 2025, the kind of sudden decline more typically associated with coup or other major shock.

Nate Schenkkan, the report’s lead author and a former research director at Freedom House, hoped to help Americans distinguish between the “push-pull” of partisan politics and the “authoritarian behavior” of the current administration.

“When a major change happens in a political system, it’s very unevenly distributed,” Schenkkan said. “Certain people will feel it first. Certain communities will feel it harder and faster. And it is really important to recognize that just because it hasn’t come to you doesn’t mean that it won’t.”

The sense of alarm is especially acute among those who witnessed democratic backsliding elsewhere. Last year, a network of former intelligence and national security professionals applied the same analytical methods they once used to assess the fragility of democracies abroad to the United States. In October, they published an intelligence-style report, concluding with “moderate to high confidence” that the country was “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule.

The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the president’s actions amount to authoritarianism, dismissing such criticism as “deeply unserious” and rooted in what the president calls “Trump derangement syndrome”. When pressed, the president has said he was handed a broad mandate to restore “law and order”, secure elections and dismantle what he has described as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.

“Here’s the reality: President Trump was resoundingly re-elected by the American people based on his America First agenda,” White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement. “Now, he’s delivering on all his campaign promises – that’s democracy in action.”

Not all scholars agree that American democracy is in imminent peril. Some are wary that democracy indices rely too heavily on subjective indicators, which can amplify pessimism and media alarm over objective markers of democratic breakdown.

“I think we should be a little cautious – not that the experts are necessarily wrong,” said Andrew Little, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, whose research has found that scholars who rate democratic threats tend toward pessimism. He favors a “minimalist” approach to measuring the health of a democracy: “Is the country having free elections, and are people following the results of those elections?”

Especially worrying for scholars of contemporary authoritarianism is the president’s close relationship with tech billionaires, or the so-called “broligarchy”, many of whom donated to and were front and center at his inauguration ceremony a year ago. At the start of his presidency, Trump appointed the Tesla and SpaceX head, Elon Musk, to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.

Oligarchs typically exert influence from the outside, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a prominent historian and author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. But with Doge, the “oligarch of oligarchs was allowed to come inside the government and was basically given the key to access our treasury, the payment systems and data systems of a superpower”, she said. “So we are innovating the autocratic playbook.”

While at the White House, Musk took a chainsaw to the federal government, firing thousands of workers in sweeping, indiscriminate cuts that were quickly challenged in court. Estimates suggest more than 300,000 federal workers left in the Trump-era exodus, draining the government of top scientists, researchers and analysts.

Traditionally autocratic regimes expand social services for supporters as a way to buy loyalty, while stripping away their political rights, Ben-Ghiat said: “That’s how they get so many people to go along and look the other way.” But Trump, she said, has diverged from that model: rather than shoring up the social safety net, his administration, abetted by congressional Republicans, has moved to “kneecap” public health and social programs, including childcare benefits – cuts Democrats plan to foreground in this year’s midterm elections.

Even the most grim assessments stress that democratic decline is not irreversible – and warn that fatalism itself can accelerate backsliding.

“History suggests that it is possible to recover from democratic erosion – but far from a guarantee,” Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and a co-director of Bright Line Watch, said by email.

Staying engaged, protesting, voting and supporting Republicans who dissent were all ways to contest Trump’s power, he said, adding: “The survival of democracy depends on people believing in its continued viability and fighting to defend it.”

Last year, millions joined No Kings rallies to denounce a president they say has wielded power like a monarch.

At the ballot box, Democrats won a series of victories in the 2025 off-year elections, and are well positioned to retake the House – and possibly the Senate – in the 2026 midterms. Trump, meanwhile, remains unpopular nationally – a vulnerability for his party heading into this year’s elections. A CNN poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, and 58% call his first year a failure.

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said. The more that gap widens, she said, “the more people will wake up”.

She pointed to Minneapolis, where Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as a response to protests against the killing of a 37-year-old US citizen by a federal immigration officer. Instead of retreating, hundreds of Minnesotans registered for training to become “observers” of enforcement activity.

In the courts, Trump’s executive actions have been met with robust legal resistance. The ACLU, which has filed over 200 legal challenges against the Trump administration in the past year, touted a nearly 65% success rate in “defeating, delaying, or diluting federal policies”.

“We judge the moment we’re in not by examining the president’s actions alone, but by evaluating the system’s response to those provocations as well,” Ben Wizner, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said.

Despite the supreme court’s conservative supermajority – cemented by Trump in his first term – and the president’s sustained campaign to delegitimize judges, Wizner retained a measured optimism: “I am confident that we will emerge from this latest stress test to our democracy with our fundamental rights intact.”

Looking ahead, many scholars predict Trump’s assault on democratic norms and the rule of law is likely to worsen in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms – an erosion that could become entrenched if Democrats fail to secure a check on his presidency by winning back a chamber of Congress.

The most recent Bright Line survey found experts increasingly worried about political violence following the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Concerns also focused on the administration’s aggressive response to peaceful protest, the weaponization of government agencies to punish political opponents, and the president’s unprecedented push to gerrymander congressional districts in Republican states.

Elsewhere, Democrats and political observers have raised fears that Trump could dispatch the national guard to polling places as an intimidation tactic, while others worry about the expansion of ICE operations in Democratic-run cities.

In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump mused that he had accomplished so much in 2025, “we shouldn’t even have an election” in 2026. The White House said he was “simply joking”. Though the federal government cannot unilaterally cancel the midterms, Trump has already taken extraordinary steps to try to change how elections are conducted.

“Autocrats try to convince us that we’re hopeless and helpless. That they’re always going to be there, and there’s no point in resisting,” Ben-Ghiat said. But political dissidents of repressive regimes know better, she said, recalling a conversation with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony.

She had asked Navalnaya how she viewed the US after Trump’s return to power. “You still have elections,” she replied. “And you can use them.”

But there’s a personal issue for just about any Illinois resident among the dozens of fights Raoul’s office is waging against the White House, the Democratic AG said while marking a year since President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Raoul’s office has joined or filed 51 lawsuits challenging administration policies since then, and has submitted more than 100 amicus briefs in the process to push back against sweeping funding cuts, military deployments in Chicago, restrictions on gender-affirming care, environmental protection rollbacks and other Trump priorities.

Raoul called it “365 days of chaos, 365 days of attacks upon civil rights, on the rule of law, and on the Constitution itself.”

“We are not demoralized, and we are certainly not exhausted,” Raoul said in front of his team of attorneys at the state’s West Loop office building. “We are standing our ground to defend the rights of the people of Illinois and the rule of law, and we’re winning in the courts.”

He pointed to Trump’s failed effort to federalize the National Guard to patrol the streets of Chicago as “an example of why to remain optimistic.” Trump gave up that effort — for now — after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court declined to lift a lower court’s block on the deployment.

Perhaps the premier court fight for Raoul’s office early in 2026 is the state’s legal challenge against Trump’s “occupation of Illinois and Chicago” by an influx of federal immigration agents.

“Our communities have faced masked agents with semi-automatic rifles who have created war zones by using tear gas, chemical weapons, and pepper balls against our law-abiding neighbors, including local police officers and journalists,” Raoul said. “We faced it here, we witnessed it in Los Angeles, in Portland, and now we watch the horror unfolding in Minnesota.”

Conversely, the same policies lambasted by Raoul and other Illinois Democratic leaders were celebrated by the White House Tuesday on a list of “365 wins in 365 days” for Trump, including driving “the number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing into the country to a record low.”

The president highlighted “targeted enforcement operations in Chicago, resulting in the city’s fewest murders since 1965” — although in fact, the White House can’t take all credit for crime falling in the city. It started dropping before he took office, and experts have yet to fully explain why violent crime figures have fallen precipitously in Chicago and beyond since a COVID-19 pandemic spike.

“It’s been an amazing period of time,” Trump said in the White House press briefing room, boasting of accomplishing “more than any other administration has done by far.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has positioned himself as one of the most forceful national voices against Trump, staged a roundtable at an Uptown coffee shop with local business owners and other professionals decrying the effects of Trump policies, from reduced day care funding to increased supply prices.

“When tariffs go up, Illinois manufacturers feel it,” Pritzker said. “When trade wars escalate, Illinois farmers pay the price. When health care costs surge, Illinois families have to make impossible choices, and when Washington breaks its promises, real people bear the consequences.”

Pritzker underscored “the uncertainty that has caused more than just anxiety. It’s actually keeping people away from seeking services… They’re threatening to take something away, then we take them to court and it gets restored.”

Raoul suggested his office could use more resources from state lawmakers to stay afloat in the sea of legal battles. He pushed for increased funding from Springfield in last year’s budget season, though that $15 million boost was mostly neutralized by a decline in proceeds from his office’s other litigation.

“The strain has been a real one,” Raoul said. “But even if we didn’t have this type of administration, I would be appealing to the General Assembly to do more, so we can serve the public in all areas.”

Pritzker will deliver his budget proposal next month, with lawmakers on the clock to pass a spending plan by the end of May.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop.","Three hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s inauguration, former Gov. Phil Murphy pocket vetoed a pair of bills designed to protect the rights of New Jersey’s immigrants, drawing ire from advocates who had pushed Murphy to sign the lame-duck legislation before his departure.

In a press release, Murphy said he would reject a data-privacy bill because of a “drafting oversight” that would have put the legislation into conflict with federal law. Murphy said the second bill — which would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that generally bars New Jersey police from cooperating with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement — goes beyond the initial policy, potentially opening the Immigrant Trust Directive to a court challenge.

“Re-opening the door to judicial scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger,” Murphy said in the release. “And that is not something I am willing to risk when the Directive is secure for the foreseeable future.”

The Legislature cannot override a pocket veto.

The two bills were part of a trio of immigration-related bills that landed on Murphy’s desk last week. Murphy signed the third: the “Safe Communities Act” directs New Jersey’s attorney general to develop policies requiring “sensitive” locations — like schools, hospitals, and courthouses — to remain accessible to all residents.

Immigrant advocates like Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, said the bills were designed to act like a package. The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, a coalition of New Jersey-based organizations pushing immigration rights, said Murphy “walked away from his promise.”

“The three immigrant protection bills were designed to work together—to protect families not only in public spaces, but also from surveillance, data sharing, and coercive entanglement with federal immigration enforcement,” Morsy said in a release. “Our communities asked for protection, and today, they were denied.”

The first bill would have limited the collection of certain data, like immigration status and place of birth. Murphy said the legislation included a “drafting oversight” that wasn’t noticed until after the bill was on his desk; he said the oversight could have cost the state billions in federal funding.

Murphy said he is “hopeful that the Legislature will reintroduce and pass this version of the legislation in the coming weeks so it can be signed into law at the soonest possible opportunity.” If the Legislature does so, it will be up to Sherrill to sign the bill.

Former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal implemented the Immigrant Trust Directive in 2018 in an effort to build trust between the state’s law enforcement agencies and immigrants. A6310, the second bill Murphy pocket vetoed, would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive. The directive has survived several challenges in court, but Murphy says the bill deviates slightly from the directive, putting the directive at risk.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Viri Martinez, the deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said Murphy’s decision was defined by fear.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said. “There is no other way to describe Governor Murphy’s refusal to sign all three immigrant protection bills but fear of the Trump administration, elevated above the will of the people.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/KBS_0975-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:45.967505

My arrest came after my participation in protests for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s siege on Gaza at the gates of Columbia University in April 2024. The Department of Homeland Security publicly stated that it had targeted me because of my advocacy for Palestinian rights.

Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives.

Since that time, an immigration judge has twice called for my release. But the Trump administration has exploited rarely used procedural loopholes to keep me confined, a practice now being challenged in federal district courts across the country, with many finding the practice unconstitutional.

My detention began on March 13, 2025, when I voluntarily went to ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what I believed to be routine immigration questions. I came to the United States on a valid visa in 2016, and mistakenly relinquished my student visa on my path to pursuing permanent residency through my U.S. citizen mother.

Instead, I was thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles away from my home in Paterson, New Jersey, where I had been working various jobs in waitressing and retail to help support myself, my mother and my younger brother with special needs.

I am not a threat. I just spoke out for Palestinian rights.

I don't consider myself a leader or an activist. I am a devout Muslim who is deeply committed to my faith and community. I am a daughter, a sister and a best friend. I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking. Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.

I was spurred to action by my conscience and personal loss, inasmuch as I was by my lived experience growing up as a Palestinian under Israel’s brutal military rule.

I was born in occupied East Jerusalem and raised in the West Bank with my father. I grew up smelling tear gas on a daily basis and seeing him humiliated by Israeli soldiers. I once woke up to an Israeli soldier pointing his rifle at my head as I lay in bed. I was only 9 years old.

I spent the first few years of my life in Gaza with my mother until the Israeli siege no longer made travel back and forth possible. I was separated from her for nearly 20 years before reuniting with her here in the United States in 2016. In a cruel twist of fate, I now find myself forcibly cut off from her once again.

I am neither a flight risk nor a national security threat, as Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has claimed.

In a landmark decision in 2025, Judge William Young found the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke visas, detain and deport noncitizens ‒ such as Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi and Badar Khan Suri ‒ for their pro-Palestinian activism were unconstitutional, because they enjoy the same free speech rights as U.S. citizens.

All have been released, but their fight against this administration's ideological deportation and enforcement policy continues. It is past time for me to be released as well.

Through my continued detention, the Trump administration aims to send a chilling message: People who speak out for Palestinian rights or criticize Israel will face retribution. This is not only morally outrageous and unconstitutional; it is deeply unpopular among Americans.

If Donald Trump is willing to trample on the Constitution to silence critics of Israel, how can he call himself an America First president? Why is his administration spending taxpayer dollars keeping me and others locked up for protesting a genocide instead of funding schools and health care?

ICE detainees are people, too. No one deserves to be treated this way.

Inside the ICE facility where I’m being held, conditions are filthy, overcrowded and inhumane. For months, I slept in a plastic shell, known as a “boat,” surrounded by cockroaches and only a thin blanket. Privacy does not exist here.

As an observant Muslim woman, I struggle to find a clean, quiet space to pray. I have lost a significant amount of weight. The food is so bad that it makes me vomit. I now avoid eating it, instead opting to consume packaged food from the commissary. Despite my continued requests, I have been denied reasonable access to halal food.

Still, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. Many women come and go through this hall of sorrows, and I try my best to help them where I can. There are others with me who cannot afford legal representation. Some have diabetes or terminal cancer, or are wheelchair bound.

Ours is a daily battle for basic dignity. None of us deserve to be treated this way. All of our voices deserve to be heard. I think, too, of the thousands of Palestinians languishing in Israeli prisons, who are subject to beatings, torture and starvation.

My detention has only increased my resolve to be a more vocal advocate for all people facing injustice.

I solemnly marked my 33rd birthday in detention. Like most people my age, I have many dreams and goals. But more than anything, I long for my freedom, to return to my mother’s warm embrace and to help her care for my younger brother.

But this story is much bigger than me. It is about the struggle for the liberation of all Palestinians and those who speak up for a freer and more just world inasmuch as it is a struggle for the soul of America.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b5746aa0-0174-4dd2-8cfc-4ddea2628c75.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-21 11:03:28.146698

According to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the naturalization ceremonies — two sessions, each swearing in about 1,300 people from more than 80 countries — are expected to proceed as scheduled, even as the region has become a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration enforcement.

The setting itself carried symbolic weight. The Pasadena Civic Auditorium will be filled not with celebrities but with former refugees, green-card holders, and longtime residents who had passed civics tests, submitted to background checks, and waited years for this moment. The ceremony itself would last barely 45 minutes.

Since Dec. 2, when the Trump administration expanded its travel ban to 39 countries following the shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan national, some naturalization applicants have been “pulled out of line” at ceremonies nationwide — their approvals revoked at the last moment, their oaths deferred indefinitely. The ceremonies continued around them.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has “paused all adjudications for aliens from high-risk countries,” according to agency Policy Memo PM-602-0192, issued Dec. 2, 2025, “while USCIS works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The affected nations span Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Central America — including Afghanistan, Somalia, Haiti, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

It is not known if any of Wednesday’s 2,600 scheduled applicants received last-minute cancellation notices. USCIS does not publicly disclose the figures.

But the agency’s own data from past Pasadena ceremonies suggests the impact could be significant: at a June 2019 ceremony, the top five countries of origin were Mexico, the Philippines, China, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Two of those nations — El Salvador and Guatemala — are now on the restricted list.

More than 117 Democratic members of Congress have signed a letter to the Department of Homeland Security secretary and USCIS director condemning the selective cancellations. Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington has led efforts demanding that USCIS disclose the number of affected individuals and provide a timeline for ending the pause.

For those who do take the oath on Wednesday, the ceremony follows a script unchanged for generations. Applicants arrive hours early for security screening and document verification. They surrender their green cards — the plastic rectangles that had defined their legal status, sometimes for decades.

It’s slated to be a blockbuster session that appears likely destined for the Supreme Court.
The California GOP has already provided notice it is appealing directly to the Supreme Court.
In Chatrie v. United States, the Supreme Court took up its next major Fourth Amendment case.
But here’s what we’re watching for now: Today: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over Trump’s efforts to fire Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook.","President Trump’s power over the Federal Reserve goes before the Supreme Court Wednesday in a blockbuster review of the central bank governors’ firing protections.

As the president wages war against the Fed for not lowering interest rates quicker, Trump has looked to sack Fed governor Lisa Cook by accusing her of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

Lower courts sided with Cook. The justices have punted a decision for months on Trump’s emergency appeal until they hold oral arguments, which are set to kick off at 10 a.m. EST.

Here’s what to watch for as the argument gets underway:

How the justices interpret ‘for cause’

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 only permits the president to remove Fed governors “for cause.”

The statute does not explicitly define “cause.” Wednesday’s case turns on how the justices interpret it.

Everyone concedes that disagreeing with a governor’s votes on interest rates isn’t sufficient. Beyond that, the sides diverge.

The Trump administration contends that “for cause” gives the president broad discretion to fire Fed governors for reasons related to their conduct, ability, fitness or competence.

If the justices agree, the administration says it’s an easy case and that the mortgage fraud accusations against Cook easily pass the test.

Cook’s lawyers push back. They say Congress intended “for cause” to be comparable to the standard in place at a handful of other independent agencies, which spell out inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance as the three preconditions to firing.

Watch to see if the justices agree with the Trump administration’s proposal, or if they agree with the concerns of Cook that it would imperil the Fed’s independence.

Does Cook’s due process argument gain steam

Regardless of whether Trump had valid “cause,” Cook will advance several other arguments Wednesday.

She asserts that due process protections under the Constitution and federal law guaranteed her a hearing to deny the mortgage fraud accusations.

“She unequivocally does, and she is prepared to refute the allegations in an appropriate forum,” Cook’s lawyers wrote.

The Trump administration says no such hearing is legally required and that Cook has not explained what it would look like or how it would make any difference.

Additionally, the administration will try to convince the justices that even if she was wrongfully removed, the lower courts had no power to grant an injunction reinstating Cook as the litigation plays out.

If the justices tip their hand on FTC decision

The case comes to the court weeks after the justices heard arguments on Trump’s power to fire Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The cases both involve the bounds of Trump’s presidential power, but they raise distinct issues.

At the Fed, Trump purports to have valid cause in sacking Cook.

But at the FTC, the president does not. Instead, he argues Slaughter’s firing protections infringe on the separation of powers — a broad assertion of presidential power that appears to have drawn sympathy with the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

The Trump administration has not made that argument for the Fed, which the justices have signaled has special status that may justify its protections.

Under the court’s typical procedures, the justices would’ve taken an initial vote on Slaughter’s case in the days following the December argument. The opinion would’ve been assigned, and drafting would commence.

Watch on Wednesday to see if the justices’ comments tip their hand on what they plan to do in Slaughter’s case.

How Powell’s attendance impacts the case

Wednesday’s argument only directly concerns Cook’s firing, but watch to see if the justices connect it to Trump’s broader threats against the central bank for not lowering interest rates quicker.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will attend Wednesday’s argument at the Supreme Court, a source familiar with his plans tells our colleagueSylvan Lane, The Hill’s business editor.

For months, Trump has mused about firing Powell. But the president has yet to do so as the clock ticks closer to May, when Powell’s term as chair ends (he may remain on the board until 2028).

In the lead-up to Wednesday’s argument, things took a turn. The Justice Department issued a subpoena to the Fed, bringing its criminal investigation into Powell to light.

The investigation centers on congressional testimony Powell gave concerning the Fed’s multi-billion-dollar renovation of its headquarters, which has faced significant cost overruns. Powell denies wrongdoing and has cast the investigation as an attempt to influence the central bank’s monetary policy.

As the Fed’s chair, Powell is formally named as a defendant in Cook’s lawsuit.

His attendance makes him the elephant in the room. Government officials typically sit near the front of the public gallery, which is in the back half of the courtroom behind the bar section.

We’ll be in the room Wednesday to watch the justices — and Powell. So stay tuned.

IN FOCUS

Looking back at 1 year of Trump v. the courts

President Trump entered the second year of his White House term this week.

As his first year rapidly remade Washington, it flooded courts across the country.

Democratic state attorneys general, legal groups formed to oppose Trump, civil rights organizations and more asked judges hundreds of times to to rule pieces of Trump’s agenda unlawful — and halt them in the meantime.

Lawsuits began flying while Trump was still in the Capitol Rotunda for his inauguration ceremony.

Within minutes of Chief Justice John Roberts administering the oath, three lawsuits sought to dismantle the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before it even got started.

They claimed DOGE was a federal advisory committee that wasn’t following transparency requirements. No judge has yet to endorse the argument, and some of the cases were later dropped.

Still, it became the first of hundreds of legal battlefronts to come.

And in the early months of the administration, challenges to DOGE dominated.

Some contested the administration’s assertion that Elon Musk was not formally in charge of the group. Others sought to subject DOGE to the Freedom of Information Act. But by and large, the cases concerned efforts to implant DOGE personnel at agencies across the government and allegations they were violating the Privacy Act.

Government unions led the charge in many of the cases. And as they would go on to do on issue after issue, left-leaning legal groups like Democracy Forward and Democracy Defenders Fund represented many of the plaintiffs in court.

And within months, they secured dozens of injunctions from federal district judges, stymying Trump’s agenda. Temporarily.

Repeatedly over the past year, the administration filed emergency appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, almost always emerging successful.

In total, the administration brought 32 Supreme Court emergency appeals. That’s more than former President Biden’s Justice Department filed during his entire four years in office.

Trump’s critics say the barrage reflects how he is acting lawlessly.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D), speaking Tuesday at an event celebrating the 54 lawsuits his office has brought against Trump, summed up the president’s first year as a “sweeping, often illegal campaign to remake America.”

“We said then if he breaks the law, we will take him to court. We are here today to say we have fulfilled that promise,” Bonta said.

The president’s legal allies push back, suggesting the nonstop pace reveals how lower judges have overstepped their authority by granting one injunction after another.

The real score is the administration’s record at the high court, those allies argue.

The exact tally depends on how you count a few mixed rulings, but on our scorecard, the administration has lost only four cases and emerged victorious in roughly 20.

Among others, that list includes greenlighting the administration’s efforts to fire more than 16,000 probationary employees, ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military, revoke temporary legal protections extended to more than 300,000 Venezuelans and parole for 532,000 people from Latin American countries, freeze $65 million in teacher preparation grants and lay off roughly half the Education Department

Only in a few cases, like Trump’s bid to deploy the National Guard in the Chicago area, did the court rule against the president.

What’s in store for his second year? Here are five issues that will define the legal landscape:

Does Trump’s string of Supreme Court victories continue as the justices begin handing down final decisions on the merits of Trump’s policies — like his sweeping tariffs and efforts to control independent agencies — rather than preliminary decisions on the emergency docket?

Will the Justice Department criminally indict more prominent Trump foes, like Powell, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and former Special Counsel Jack Smith?

Will the Supreme Court rein in judges who’ve granted nationwide relief to plaintiffs by signing off on class actions in the wake of the justices clawing back universal injunctions?

Will Trump’s rapid pace of executive orders, which now exceeds 200, slow down?

Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act?

Alien Enemies Act back in court

One of the most prominent legal battles of Trump’s first year back in the White House returns to the courtroom later this week.

Last March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.

It began with sending dozens of migrants to a Salvadoran megaprison. Another wave in April was underway when the Supreme Court intervened in the middle of the night to halt the flights at the pleas of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The deportations became a prominent sign last spring of Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

In the months since, the legal battle has calmed in some respects. It’s about to return to the spotlight.

On Thursday, all 17 active judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will convene at the federal courthouse in New Orleans to hear oral arguments on whether Trump legally invoked the Alien Enemies Act.

It’s slated to be a blockbuster session that appears likely destined for the Supreme Court. More than a half-dozen other legal challenges to Trump’s use of the law are on hold, all awaiting word from the 5th Circuit.

The Alien Enemies Act allows the president to summarily deport migrants when a foreign nation perpetrates an “invasion” or predatory “incursion.” It has only been invoked three prior times: the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II.

Trump claims Tren de Aragua is perpetrating an invasion against the U.S., and he has tied the transnational criminal gang to the Venezuelan government.

In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants detained under the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal before they are deported.

That decision leaves several questions unanswered that have been simmering ever since. The 5th Circuit will get the next bite at the apple Thursday.

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt will argue the Alien Enemies Act requires a a declaration of war or a military attack for the president to invoke the law.

The statute requires the attack be committed by a foreign nation, and Gelernt will make the case that Trump can’t tie his concerns about Tren de Aragua to deposed President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

And even if the president did lawfully invoke the statute, Gelernt will argue that migrants should be afforded at least 30-days’ notice to ensure the Trump administration can’t deport them without judicial review.

The Trump administration will be represented by Drew Ensign, who leads immigration litigation for the Justice Department. He will assert that the Alien Enemies Act compels the courts to provide the president extreme deference.

Tren de Aragua has perpetrated an invasion “by any metric” and is sufficiently connected to Maduro’s government, administration wrote in court filings. The administration has also argued requiring 30-days’ notice is unwarranted.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Roundup weed killer, geofence warrants

The court took up four new cases at Friday’s conference, perhaps the final cases that will be argued this term.

First, the court agreed to hear Bayer’s appeal to limit liability for its Roundup weed killer, which has come under thousands of lawsuits alleging it causes cancer and did not include a proper warning label.

Bayer argues the state lawsuits are preempted by federal law, which does not require the warning. The case is Monsanto Company v. Durnell.

In Chatrie v. United States, the Supreme Court took up its next major Fourth Amendment case.

The justices will review whether geofence warrants, which allow law enforcement to seize information on cellphones online at a location during a specific time window, violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.

The court will also review an employment retirement plan case interpreting the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (ERISA).

In Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee, the justices will examine whether plaintiffs alleging their employer’s plan underperformed must show a “meaningful benchmark,” which would make it more difficult to bring ERISA lawsuits.

Finally, the court agreed to hear Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA v. Amarin Pharma.

The fight between the two pharma companies poses broad implications for so-called “skinny labels,” which allow generic drugmakers to bring products to market faster by carving out a product’s brand-name, patented use on the label.

OUT: SCOTUS fee waivers

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s juniormost liberal justice, has thoughts on how the court handles filings from incarcerated defendants.

The Supreme Court chooses what cases it hears. But anyone can try their luck, so long as they submit a $300 filing fee and pay to print 40 bound copies (yes, this is still a requirement in 2026, and Jackson noted it’s usually the much higher cost).

The justices routinely waive the fee for poor incarcerated defendants who can’t afford it. But if the defendant then repeatedly tries to file frivolous litigation, the court cuts them off.

The court did so Tuesday for a handful of defendants, including Danny Howell, who was sentenced to 70 years in prison after being convicted of child molestation and other charges. The clerk will no longer accept “any further petitions in noncriminal matters” from Howell unless he pays the fee.

“Even if Howell were to identify meritorious grounds for habeas relief or wanted to bring a justifiable challenge to his conditions of confinement, he will now be prevented from doing so unless he pays the filing fee—no matter what,” Jackson wrote in dissent.

“A categorical, forward-looking filing bar is a questionable restriction as to any litigant who cannot afford to pay a filing fee. For me, it is an intolerable one as to incarcerated individuals.”

(And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.)
Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.” Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office.
But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.
In contrast, local officials in Democratic-led cities and states have resisted Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops.","In the first year of his second term, President Trump has cited an arsenal of falsehoods, baseless claims and distortions to justify significant policy changes on the economy, immigration and deployments of the military.

His case for ushering in a turnaround rests on inaccurate superlatives (the “worst inflation” ever under his predecessor and the “best numbers” now under his presidency), mathematically impossible figures (a “600 percent” decline in drug prices) and evidence-free assertions (the decimation of maritime drug smuggling).

Here’s a fact-check of some of the falsehoods that fueled Mr. Trump’s first year back.

This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has long overstated the unauthorized migration under his predecessor and has wrongly portrayed most migrants as criminals. Likewise, contrary to his claims, most migrants deported in his first year back in office had no criminal convictions.

First, the 25 million figure is more than double most credible estimates of unauthorized migration under the Biden administration. (And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.) Mr. Trump has also not provided any evidence of his repeated assertion that “many” of those migrants were criminals and “some of the worst people on earth.”

From the 2021 to 2024 fiscal years, officials recorded roughly 11 million “encounters” of unauthorized migrants at borders and ports of entry, including about seven million at the southwestern border with Mexico. More than a quarter of the migrants were repeat offenders. Republican lawmakers have estimated that about 2.2 million more unauthorized migrants evaded detection during this time. And a March report from the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that supports lower levels of immigration, estimated that 11.5 million to 12.5 million migrants — both legal and illegal — settled in the United States under the Biden administration.

Most migrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Mr. Trump’s first year had no criminal convictions. In late November, of the 65,000 people in detention, about 26 percent had a criminal conviction, 26 percent had pending charges and 47 percent had immigration violations, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit at Syracuse University.

A New York Times analysis of ICE arrests and detentions from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 of last year found that just 7 percent of those arrested nationwide had a violent conviction. Thirty-seven percent had a previous conviction, with driving under the influence and traffic violations as the most common offenses. A third had no criminal charges at all. And in locales where ICE has conducted high-profile operations — Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and across Massachusetts — more than half had no charges at all.

False. Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.”

Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office. That was far from the “worst” recorded — inflation was much higher in the 1980s, when it topped 14 percent. The rate declined slightly to 2.7 percent in December, the most recent month with available data.

Unemployment grew to 4.4 percent in December 2025, up from 4 percent that January. For comparison, unemployment surged to 14.8 percent in April 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, and it was 6.4 percent in January 2021, the last month of Mr. Trump’s first term.

Nominal median wage growth, too, fell to 3.7 percent by December 2025 from 4.2 percent in January of that year. After adjusting for inflation, real hourly earnings grew at 1.1 percent in both December 2024 and December 2025, while real weekly earnings grew to 1.1 percent in December 2025 from 0.5 percent in December 2024. None of those figures were historically high or historically low.

Gross domestic product did increase to a robust 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, compared with 1.9 percent in the last quarter of 2024. In comparison, the economy grew at a faster clip in the third quarter of 2023 at 4.7 percent and contracted in the first quarter of 2025 by 0.6 percent.

A White House official cited two less commonly cited economic measures — the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index and its count of shipments of manufacturing orders — hitting record highs under Mr. Trump. But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.

Trade

What Was said

First, his $18 trillion figure is almost double the White House’s own tally of investments ($9.6 trillion). While it is possible that the pledges will result in economic gains, those effects have yet to come to fruition.

The $9.6 trillion also includes broad pledges and previously announced projects. And more than half of that amount comes from informal pledges from foreign countries to invest in the United States that experts warn may be unrealistic. For example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates each pledged more than $1 trillion in investments, which is more than their gross domestic products.

And so far, there is little evidence that Mr. Trump’s tariffs have ushered in a manufacturing renaissance, job and wage growth, or a decline in drug prices. Economists have said that the sustained economic growth in the United States was in spite of tariffs, not because of them.

The manufacturing sector shed 63,000 jobs from January 2025 to December 2025. Construction spending in manufacturing has also declined. Economic activity in the sector in general contracted for 10 consecutive months in 2025, according to a longstanding survey by the Institute for Supply Management.

Mr. Trump’s claim that his tariffs brought a decline of 400 to 600 percent in drug prices is not mathematically possible. A 100 percent decline would mean that the product is free.

The White House cited data from Customs and Border Protection showing that officials with the agency’s Air and Marine Operations in the United States seized a record amount of drugs in July — more than 220,000 pounds — and that number has since fallen to 2,000 pounds in December. But of that figure of 220,000 pounds, more than 200,000 pounds was of marijuana and it is unclear where those interdictions took place. Moreover, C.B.P. is not the only agency that seizes drugs.

As the strikes occurred, the Coast Guard continued to conduct other maritime drug enforcement operations. For example, the Coast Guard reported seizing nearly 20,000 pounds of cocaine across 10 days in November as part of Operation Pacific Viper. The Coast Guard also announced on Thursday the seizure of more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine in a 45-day patrol in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.

Jeremy McDermott and Steven Dudley, the co-founders of InSight Crime, a Latin America crime and security think tank, wrote in a recent post that while the military strikes had likely disrupted some drug routes, the campaign had not halted trafficking altogether.

“This has not stopped the flow of drugs; it simply forced traffickers to use different routes and modus operandi,” they wrote.

Executive Power

What Was said

This is misleading. Mr. Trump has justified deploying National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities by overstating their crime rates, and then overstating the impact of those deployments. After the Supreme Court ruled in December that he could not deploy the Guard over the objections of local officials in Illinois, Mr. Trump instead asserted his authority to deploy more conventional troops to American cities — an authority, he argued misleadingly, that most other presidents had exercised.

Mr. Trump’s claims about the National Guard’s effect on crime in Portland, Ore., were particularly inaccurate, as the Guard barely had a presence in the city.

In late September, after protests over immigration enforcement in Portland, Mr. Trump announced he would deploy the Guard to the city. Local officials challenged the deployment in court almost immediately. Emails released in court showed — and a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged — that about seven to 10 members of Oregon’s National Guard were briefly sent to an ICE building in downtown Portland from about 11:30 in the morning on Oct. 4 and left sometime at night, after a judge barred the deployment in the afternoon. After the Supreme Court ruling in December, Mr. Trump abandoned his efforts to deploy the Guard to Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles.

The White House cited a decline in crime from September, when Mr. Trump announced the deployment, to November. But even before the announcement and the half-day deployment of a handful of troops in October, crime in Portland had been falling, with homicides already declining by more than 50 percent in the first half of 2025 and violent crime down by 17 percent. Last year, the local police recorded 4,000 to 5,200 monthly offenses from January to November, the month with the most recent data available. The greatest number of offenses were recorded in October, the month with the brief appearance of National Guard troops.

Mr. Trump’s contention that half his predecessors have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, which gives the president broad authority to mobilize troops domestically under certain conditions, is overstated and leaves out critical context.

Since the 1790s, 17 presidents have used or invoked the Insurrection Act a total of 30 times, according to a timeline compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. That’s about 38 percent of all presidents. Most invocations — 19 instances — occurred before 1900. Many of the invocations in the last century occurred during the Civil Rights era. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoked the act after the governor of Arkansas deployed the state’s National Guard to stop nine Black students from enrolling at a high school in Little Rock.

Most recently, President George H.W. Bush invoked the act twice, not 22 times as Mr. Trump said, in 1989 to quell looting after a hurricane in the Virgin Islands and in 1992 to quell unrest after the police beating of Rodney King. Mr. Bush invoked the act at the request of the California governor. In contrast, local officials in Democratic-led cities and states have resisted Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/us/politics/dc-fact-check-2/dc-fact-check-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:57:39.262221

State and local leaders are not confirming anything credible right now, even as advocacy groups and immigration lawyers prepare for the worst.

More than a hundred students at Red Mountain High School in Mesa on Tuesday took to standing up against ICE operations around the country. Communities in the Valley are bracing for what could happen here.

“The concern is that if ICE and border patrol were to come to Arizona as they’re doing in Minneapolis, that is concerning to us,” said Jose Patino, with the immigration advocacy group Aliento.

Groups like Aliento say they have not heard anything concrete about whether ICE could surge in the Phoenix metro. That is not stopping them from preparing the community for anything: Teaching people to have their documents ready and to know their rights.

“We always tell folks not to panic, but be prepared. You just never know when it’s going to rain,” said Patino.

For their part, ICE Director Todd Lyons told Scripps News their job is to keep neighborhoods safe.

“Over 70 percent of people that are in ICE detention right now either have a criminal conviction or a pending criminal charge,"" said Lyons.

ABC15 contacted local ICE officials to ask about enforcement in Arizona, but we did not receive a response.

ABC15 anchor Javier Soto also sat down with Governor Katie Hobbs earlier this month to ask about immigration enforcement.

“There was a report last week that said Arizona, specifically Phoenix, was the next target for mass immigration sweeps. Have you been able to confirm that, and what’s your response to that?” asked Soto.

“So I’m not going to act on rumors, and there’s a lot of reporting out there. We want to make sure we’re getting in front of misinformation. We’ve been in contact with the administration. We can’t confirm anything,” replied Hobbs.

But how much will Arizona law enforcement work with federal immigration officers?

According to ProPublica, of at least 106 municipal police departments, sheriff's offices, and county attorneys in the state, only nine currently have agreements to cooperate with ICE in making arrests, as of late last year.

Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan posted on social media over the weekend, promising to protect ICE agents and arrest anyone interfering with their work.

One immigration lawyer we spoke with says it is only a matter of time before ICE shows up here in full force.

Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15.","Federal immigration agents pulled over a Hispanic high school football coach driving his players to a game and pointed a pistol at his head.

They swarmed a high school parking lot to question Hispanic students about their citizenship. When the teens explained they were U.S. citizens, agents loaded them into a Border Patrol vehicle anyway.

Agents plowed their vehicles through the high school's baseball diamond and football fields. And they questioned the school secretary's citizenship on her way home from work.

This wasn't Minneapolis, Los Angeles, or Chicago in recent months. It was El Paso, Texas – back in 1992.

The U.S. Border Patrol at the time was operating with impunity, aggressively going after anyone who looked Hispanic and lived in aneighborhood near the U.S.-Mexico border.

A rights movement gained traction in the wake of a community lawsuit, and grassroots organizers soon began warning the rest of the country that tactics applied at the U.S.-Mexico border eventually could be exported to American cities everywhere.

""We were saying: The border will become the nation,"" said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights. ""And then it happened.""

Enhanced powers in the border zone

The 19 million people living in the Southwest border zone, which extends 100 miles inland, are under constant surveillance. They're at risk of getting in the way of the Border Patrol's high-speed vehicle pursuits. And they're surrounded in all directions by federal highway checkpoints where they must affirm or prove their U.S. citizenship.

Sito Negron, 59, originally from the Bronx borough in New York, moved to El Paso as a teenager in the 1980s and quickly learned the exceptions to ""normal"" American life on the border.

""The first time I went through an interior checkpoint, I was like, 'What the (expletive) is this?' "" he said. He had believed, until then, ""that Americans are free because we don't have armed, uniformed, paramilitary officers roaming around to verify my identity and my ability to move around.""

But in the border zone, by law, federal agents can push the limits of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in ways they cannot in the country's interior. (The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches; the Fourteenth guarantees equal protection under the law, regardless of race.)

What's less known is that the 100-mile zone doesn't just include border cities and towns like San Diego, Tucson in Arizona, or El Paso and Brownsville in Texas. It stretches 100 miles inland from every coast and along the northern border to include Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, New York, Miami, New Orleans and Houston. It includes more than 200 million people ‒ nearly two-thirds of the nation's population.

Within that sprawling zone, much of it rarely enforced as a ""border"" until now, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and agents can board public transportation, set up checkpoints and question people about their immigration status – without a warrant or probable cause, according to the Southern Border Communities Coalition. American Civil Liberties Union affiliates are challenging these actions in Washington, DC, Chicago and Minneapolis, which are more than 250 miles from the Canadian border.

Despite the distances and the agency's documented history of rights abuses, the executive branch, backed by the courts, has fortified Border Patrol ""with extra-Constitutional powers,"" Garcia said.

""Now Border Patrol, trained at the U.S.-Mexico border, is the one leading immigration enforcement agencies in other areas of the nation,"" he said.

Immigration enforcers, two different agencies

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has emerged as the brand-name enforcer of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. ""ICE Watch"" groups in Minneapolis and other major cities track immigration enforcers' movements. Protestors chant slogans, calling for ICE's abolition. Hollywood stars are sporting ""ICE out"" pins on red carpets.

But in social media videos and photographs of violent encounters, including in Minneapolis, it's often agents wearing Border Patrol patches conducting the enforcement.

CBP is the nation's largest law enforcement agency, with more than 25,000 customs officers and more than 19,000 Border Patrol agents.

ICE, the agency tasked with conducting immigration enforcement in the nation'sinterior, was small by comparison with roughly 6,000 deportation agents before a recent hiring spree. Historically, ICE targeted immigrants who had committed serious crimes, surveilling and quietly arresting them.

In Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis, Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino has directed enforcement operations, aided by an elite, El Paso, Texas-based Border Patrol force known as BORTAC.

It's essential for border agents to find and arrest migrants who arrived during the Biden administration and weren't properly vetted, said Art Del Cueto, a retired Border Patrol agent.

""I can't say it's a great look when all these individuals are heavily armed in camouflage in city streets,"" he said, ""but they're there for the ineptitude of the last administration.""

In a post on the social media site X, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both ICE and Border Patrol, said ""Operation Metro Surge"" in Minneapolis has so far led to the arrest of 2,500 alleged ""murderers, fraudsters, predators and gang members.""

The DHS declined a USA TODAY request for a breakdown of Border Patrol agents and ICE officers among the roughly 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minneapolis.

Regardless of who's doing the enforcement, immigration agents deployed to interior cities are creating more problems than they're solving, said Minneapolis council member Jason Chavez.

""You have our immigrant neighbors driving to work … shaking as they are holding their wheel and praying to God that they are going to make it to work and then make it back home,"" Chavez said.

On Jan. 15, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol, its commanders and other federal agencies, alleging a ""startling pattern of abuse"" in Minneapolis that includes ""violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity.""

Minnesota also sued the DHS to stop the ongoing immigration enforcement, describing it as a ""federal invasion."" On Jan. 14, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the operations.

The Minnesota Star Tribune's next-day, front-page headline could have been torn out of an old El Paso newspaper: ""Citizens sue, seek ruling to rein in agents' tactics.' ""

Border Patrol's actions 'didn't make the community safer'

El Pasoans won relief in that 1992 lawsuit, and it opened the door to better communication and cooperation between the community and Border Patrol.

""The judge recognized the boundaries that were being pushed,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. ""The way Border Patrol was acting during that era created a chilling effect in the community and it didn't make the community safer. It created mistrust.""

El Paso shares an urban border with Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Bowie High School – the center of the 1990s enforcement controversy – overlooks the borderline. Today, the city is more than 80% Hispanic and votes majority Democrat, but Trump gained traction in the last election.

It's a region of contradictions, where immigration enforcement is militarized, but Border Patrol agents coach the local soccer team; where a majority of residents can trace their roots to Mexico, including border agents themselves; where racial profiling is an uncomfortable reality of daily life for many, by agents who are also Hispanic.

Ruby Montana, 44, grew up in El Paso; her dad was a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and ’90s. She recalled how he kept photos of himself posing over handcuffed migrants, ""as if they were hunting trophies,"" she said. She fought with him about it, reminded him that his own parents came from Mexico without permission.

Today, Montana is a Chicano studies professor at the University of Texas at El Paso and works closely with Border Patrol to rescue animals found along the border. She sees the two faces of the agency, the institutional biases that can lead to heavy-handed enforcement, but also the individuals who call her for help with abandoned animals.

""People will say, 'Border Patrol is just following the laws,'"" she said. ""Technically, people here illegally are breaking the law – a misdemeanor – and agents are following their orders. Slavery was the law of the land. Hiding Jews from Nazis was breaking the law. A lot of people are conflating laws with morals.""

After the 1992 lawsuit,Garcia's Border Network for Human Rights became the conduit for an engagement model that included regular roundtables with Border Patrol leadership and led to a sharp reduction in complaints about the agency's tactics.

That cooperation has largely ended under Trump, Garcia said.

""There was a successful story in the past,"" he said. ""Now the relationship is in limbo.""

Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15. Concerns about the old days of blanket enforcement prompted local Democrat officials to hold a news conference and call for restraint.

""We were being aggressively occupied in that era,"" Negron said. ""The federal government heard the community and realized it was wrong. Now they're doing this in the rest of the country.""

He added, ""Americans should not get used to living in these conditions.""

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County.
It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said.","A sitting county controller and U.S. House candidate maintains that a federal agency hasn’t paid its rent to Lehigh County since 2022, despite occupying office space owned by the government body.

Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller, announced Tuesday that Homeland Security Investigations — which falls within the broader Immigration and Customs Enforcement framework at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — owes the county $115,426, not including late fees of $7,600.

“I don’t think as a county government we should be supporting anything like that,” said Pinsley. “We should deport ICE out of our building so that we’re not associated … We should be supporting our residents in every way that we can.”

Following Pinsley’s findings, newly elected county executive Josh Siegel said he would move to “evict” federal agents, according to the Morning Call.

Pinsley’s held his position since 2020 and ran unsuccessfully for state auditor general in 2024. He’s now in a crowded Democratic primary to challenge first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican aligned with President Donald Trump. The Lehigh Valley’s 7th District is a perennial toss-up and closely watched by politicos nationwide.

He spoke to the Capital-Star Tuesday ahead of the announcement, tying a recommendation to issue an eviction notice with a repudiation of the federal agency’s recent actions in Minnesota and beyond.

The outsized presence of federal officials in Minneapolis has increased city tensions, prompting protests, mass arrests and networks of private citizens countering agency actions. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found the majority believe ICE was being “too tough,” while 54% of those interviewed believed that immigration officer Jonathan Ross was “not justified” in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

Neither Homeland Security nor ICE immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.

Lehigh County isn’t among the agencies in the commonwealth that has a formal agreement to help ICE with immigration enforcement. The county’s policy is to cooperate with the agency “to the fullest extent legally possible.”

What happened?

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County. First, the two government agencies would sign a Memorandum of Agreement for ten months, followed by a three-year lease from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 31, 2026.

The former would net the county $29,250 while the latter would bring in another $111,745, according to an agreement attached to a Board of Commissioners meeting agenda from November 2022.

Loading...

Commissioners didn’t spend more than five minutes discussing the agreement during its first reading on Nov. 9, 2022 or its final vote on Nov. 22, 2022.

“I think this would be a great opportunity with the county and Homeland Security and give us the opportunity to welcome them into our county,” said sponsoring commissioner Zakiya Smalls at the latter meeting.

But only the first document ever got the required signature from HSI, while the lease remained unsigned.

“Normally, once a contract gets signed, it goes into our computer system and then we know to expect revenue,” said Pinsley. “In this case, that never happened because it was never signed.”

Pinsley reported that the federal government told him that Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker “lacked proper authority” to sign the memorandum. At the time, media described Walker as a deputy special agent for Homeland in Philadelphia who oversaw investigations into sex and drug trafficking.

According to his LinkedIn, Walker was working as an acting assistant director when he left the agency in September 2025 to become a senior vice president at an anti-trafficking nonprofit.

Lehigh County’s Pinsley said that a tip to his office following a recent administration change at the county level brought the lack of payment to the forefront as the federal agency explores a new lease past the expiration of the original proposal — which he said could be signed with ICE, not HSI.

“I don’t think we should be housing HSI at all. It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said. “I don’t care if they call it HSI or ICE. It doesn’t matter what the name is.”

Two of Pennsylvania’s 19 U.S. House members signed onto an effort to impeach Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, last week. Noem has repeatedly defended her agency’s actions, backtracking after initially claiming officers weren’t using chemical weapons like pepper spray against protesters. The effort would need Republican support, since the party holds the majority in both the House and Senate.

Next steps

Pinsley said he is “hopeful that we will be able to collect the money that is owed.”

“Ultimately, they did reside in our county and it was never meant to be free, and so they should have to pay,” said Pinsley. “I believe they should have to pay market rate, which is definitely above” the rate included under the unsigned lease.

Pinsley said he would also recommend that the county launch a database allowing locals to report alleged ICE misdeeds, such as the physical altercations or damage to personal property reported in Minneapolis.

He additionally called for “stability” in the nation’s immigration system that didn’t change from administration to administration, as well as a “path to citizenship” for “someone who’s been working here ten years and is paying taxes and is a good neighbor.”

“When (President Donald Trump) was talking about this, he was talking about violent felons. But we’re not going after violent felons — they’re going after grandma now,” said Pinsley. “And when they’re doing that, they’re causing a lot of fear. They’re tear gassing people; they’re using pepper balls; they’re putting on masks in American cities. I have no tolerance for that.”

According to December data analyzed by the New York Times, one-third of immigrants arrested by ICE have no history of criminal charges, compared to 7% with violent convictions.

In contrast, Mackenzie offered his support to ICE agents during a public appearance last week, telling the Lehigh Valley News that in the Good shooting, “When situations are in the heat of the moment, law enforcement has to take proper actions to keep themselves safe. That’s what this individual did.”

Democrats are targeting Mackenzie’s swing district seat in their effort to flip control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Along with Pinsley, six other Democrats are running for a chance to challenge Mackenzie:

Bob Brooks, firefighter and president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association

Former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell

Bethlehem resident Aidan Gonzalez

Former Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure

Former PPL Electrics Utilities executive Carol Obando-Derstine

The US Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a US citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out on to the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by the Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap on Sunday afternoon and said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,” he said. “They didn’t show any warrant; they just broke down the door.”

Amid a huge surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protesters and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” said Kaohly Her, the St Paul mayor and a Hmong American, in a statement about Thao’s arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Thao, who has been a US citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his four-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao’s family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere” and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a US citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

The US Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao’s family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims”.

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property’s owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

The DHS did not respond to a request from the Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao’s home.

Thao’s son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin’s boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

The family said they were particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the US government because his mother had to flee to the US from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao’s adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the US government’s “secret war” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, “treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with US personnel”, her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he is planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against the DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don’t feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82165fd0c75e3fe4f4a29f34e32e51f797f9518c/463_0_4769_3816/master/4769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77a465c59d05240809516dd9f910cbfa",N,,2026-01-21 09:58:03.871704

Just in the past few weeks, a woman in Minneapolis was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the U.S. government attacked Venezuela and captured its head of state, and Trump withdrew the United States from more than 60 international cooperation efforts. It’s a dangerous and volatile moment in U.S. history, one that is a culmination of a huge slide toward authoritarian practices many of us could never have imagined.

Amnesty International has long documented authoritarian practices in many countries and contexts. We recognize the warning signs and so are ringing the alarm bells. And we also know there is still time to stop it.

Trump silences free speech and punishes journalists

Over the past year, the Trump administration has leveraged multiple tools, including government censorship and targeting protesters, to try to crush dissent. Peaceful protesters, particularly students and activists advocating for Palestinian rights, have been singled out for punishment, with the clear aim of spreading fear among all who might dare to raise their voices.

Universities have come under pressure to suppress student voices, with academic freedom and freedom of expression thrown to the wayside. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester at Columbia University, was detained for months before a judge ordered his release, simply for speaking his mind.

Despite his release, he continues to face immigration proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a 33-year-old Palestinian woman, has been arbitrarily detained since March following a protest at Columbia University. Their examples send a clear message: Exercising the right to speak out can put your liberty and your future in this country at risk. The goal is clear: to instill fear and make dissent too dangerous to attempt.

At the same time, the administration has sought to limit press freedom. Journalists covering protests and human rights violations have been detained, harassed, threatened and, in some cases, like U.S.-based Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, deported. Punishing journalists is a key feature of authoritarian practices, as it denies the public the needed information to hold those in power accountable, thus enabling human rights violations to go unchecked.

These attacks on freedom of speech and press are reinforced by the expansion of surveillance and increased law enforcement and military presence in our communities. Across the country, militarized federal forces have been deployed − often over the objections of local officials and in defiance of court rulings.

Protesters challenging or recording cruel ICE tactics have been met with riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets, threats of arrests and pointed guns, deterring others from speaking out. And sometimes with deadly consequences, as we saw in Minneapolis.

Trump's policies hurt human rights agreements

Vilifying and targeting immigrants while cracking down on protests against Trump’s cruel policies are central to this administration’s authoritarian practices. People seeking safety at the border are denied their right to seek asylum. Immigrants are being detained and deported at historic levels, many without warrants or due process. People are being held in inhumane conditions, enduring torture, denied medical care and cut off from legal counsel.

What makes this moment especially dangerous is the administration’s simultaneous assault on the institutions designed to restrain power and ensure oversight and accountability. The Trump administration is attempting to curb the authority of courts when they issue rulings the White House doesn't agree with and threatening lawyers and judges.

It isn’t only in the United States. Not even three days into 2026, President Trump attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising grave concerns for further escalation of human rights violations in Venezuela and the entire region. This followed months of U.S. air strikes on boats that killed more than 100 people off the Venezuelan coast and in the Pacific.

Furthermore, the administration has significantly altered critical global human rights agreements and bodies, cruelly and chaotically zeroed out foreign assistance, and modeled a disregard for human rights and global norms. In short, President Trump’s actions on the international stage are a dangerous wrecking ball to accountability and justice – and lethal to life and liberty.

After a year, a clear pattern has emerged: systematic erosion of human rights, and open disregard for the systems meant to protect human rights. The Trump administration has violated international law, punished protesters, silenced journalists, militarized communities and sidelined the courts.

The question now is not whether more rights will be eroded, but whose will be next. The future of human rights in the United States and beyond depends on whether we confront this crisis now or allow it to deepen unchecked.

This moment demands action from all of us. We must call on lawmakers to hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. We must demand that colleges and universities safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment.

We must demand that the United States reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems. Courts must continue to serve as a check on executive abuses. We must not turn away or normalize attacks on freedom of expression and protest. We must not accept this.

We all have the human right to live freely, equally and in dignity. Together, we must move forward on the path of accountability, courage and collective action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88103821007-usatsi-27965893.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x0,y310&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 06:59:24.874419

Best, Mayor Erin Mendenhall _______","Reports have circulated that federal immigration authorities are exploring the use of a Salt Lake City property for a potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility.

City officials confirmed they have not been formally notified of a finalized proposal, but Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall sent a letter on Jan. 15, 2026, to Ritchie Group principal Ryan Ritchie outlining zoning and infrastructure concerns tied to any high-occupancy or restricted-movement use of the site.

According to the mayor’s office, the letter was sent without confirmation of a specific parcel, but was based on media reporting of the proposed location and the Ritchie Group’s ownership of several industrial sites within that area.

Utah reported among states for potential ICE detention center

The property in question, the mayor writes, is located in an M1 zoning district, which the city says is intended for light industrial uses that do not significantly impact nearby properties.

In her letter, Mendenhall noted that if the building were used to house more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted, the site would be required to meet a different set of building and safety standards, including requirements for bathrooms, exits, and fire suppression systems.

The mayor also raised concerns about the area’s water and sewer capacity, stating the surrounding utility infrastructure was designed for warehouse-level use, not for a large residential or detention population.

City officials said any lease or occupancy permit would require those issues to be addressed before approval. As of publication, neither ICE nor the Ritchie Group has publicly confirmed whether negotiations are underway.

A spokesman for the mayor's office said they have not received a response from Ritchie or the Ritchie Group.

Request for comment from the Ritchie Group about the letter or the prospect of an ICE detention facility at one of their properties was not immediately returned Tuesday.

Here is the full text of the letter sent by Mayor Erin Mendenhall to Ryan Ritchie:

Dear Ryan,

I am reaching out after learning of the potential interest by federal agencies in property owned by Ritchie. Although I lack solid information on both their interest and your engagement with them, I wanted to provide some potentially relevant information regarding the property and applicable City regulations.

The property of note is located within an M1 zone, intended to provide an environment for light industrial uses with no significant impact to nearby properties.

If the property were to be utilized for the housing of more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted in any way, it would need to comply with our building code and its requirements for bathrooms, exits, fire suppression systems, and more.

Additionally, any potential usage changes would have an enormous impact on our water and sewer infrastructure and capacity. The area’s utility system has been built specifically for warehouse use, not high occupancy, and there are downstream constraints. We do not have the public utilities infrastructure to serve a large residential population.

If you intend to lease the building, please note that all of these concerns would need to be addressed before receiving an occupancy permit.

Should you or your team want to discuss these factors with the City, we are always happy to connect.

Best,

Mayor Erin Mendenhall

It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.
But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest.
Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.","It was over in a flash.

Masked federal agents descended on a one-story home in St. Paul, Minn., on Sunday and dragged a man wearing nothing but his underwear and slip-on shoes from his doorstep, through an icy snowbank and into an idling S.U.V.

Tires screeched. Whistles sounded. Neighbors shrieked in the background. And then the agents and the man were gone.

The arrested man was identified as ChongLy Scott Thao, a Hmong immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family. He was released about an hour later without being charged, they said.

The images of the diminutive, barely clad man being led away through freezing temperatures spread instantly. The Department of Homeland Security said Mr. Thao’s arrest was made amid an attempt by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain convicted sex offenders. But in a community on edge, the operation quickly came to represent what critics call a callous and brutal enforcement campaign.

It has also has touched off panic on St. Paul’s east side, where a large population of Hmong people has lived for decades. Neighbors in the area have described a surge of immigration raids in recent days targeting people of Asian descent.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that the arrest had been part of a targeted operation seeking two sex offenders who lived at the address with Mr. Thao. On Tuesday, they identified two men from Laos and said both are wanted for sexual assault. It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.

Local officials and Mr. Thao’s family have disputed the department’s account, describing instead a chaotic case of mistaken identity and an incursion of armed agents who forcibly removed a U.S. citizen from a residence without presenting a warrant or allowing him to show identification.

“ChongLy was taken outside in freezing weather wearing only underwear and Crocs, placed into an SUV, and driven around for nearly an hour while being questioned,” Louansee Moua, Mr. Thao’s sister-in-law, wrote in a description of the event on a GoFundMe page fund-raising for Mr. Thao’s legal fees and other costs.

The family declined to comment further on the arrest on Tuesday. But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest. “They didn’t say sorry or anything,” he said.

Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul, who said she knows the Thao family personally, said that available evidence showed that agents had the wrong person and were offered information to confirm that. “And they just ignored that information,” she said.

Dana Haberman, a neighbor who witnessed the raid, said roughly 10 vans carrying federal agents appeared on the street. The agents, some of whom carried rifles and riot shields, walked up the front steps to Mr. Thao’s home and knocked several times, waiting about a minute, before using a battering ram to break down the door, he said.

“Seeing this elderly man being taken out like that,” Mr. Haberman said, “the frustration is palpable.”

Mr. Thao was driven around for almost an hour while the agents questioned him. After fingerprinting him and running his information, they returned him home, Ms. Moua said.

In its statement on Monday, homeland security said that Mr. Thao had refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified and that he had matched the description of the two sex offenders they were seeking. “It is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote on social media. It did not appear that any other members of the family were arrested on Sunday.

Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.

The ordeal has been particularly painful for Hmong residents in the Twin Cities, many of whom fled Laos as refugees after supporting the United States in its fight against communism during the Vietnam War. The Twin Cities has one of the largest concentrations of Hmong immigrants in the United States.

""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""","The U.S. Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.

A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting ""ICE out"" and ""Justice for Renee Good."" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

RELATED STORY | Federal immigration crackdown engulfs Twin Cities in daily clashes

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said.

After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.
ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities.
By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.
In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.""","Just 10 years ago, the annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, was less than $6 billion — notably smaller than other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.

The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.

""With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,"" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.

ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.

A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission

ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.

In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.

Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.

When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.

Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.

To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.

The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.

As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000."" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)

According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.

The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.

What else will the new funds be spent on?

With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.

ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost "" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.""

""ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,"" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.

The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.

O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.

""All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,"" she said. ""It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2F22%2F55db3f65464c9460c780ae2cf733%2Fap25330456653535.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:58:26.246797

Why it matters: Democrats largely agree that the bill doesn't go far enough in constraining ICE and Customs and Border Patrol officers, but some in the party still feel compelled to vote to fund the department as a whole.

""It's going to be a tough vote for everyone,"" said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), who represents battleground-district House Democrats in leadership, telling Axios she is personally undecided.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) isn't offering any guidance so far, telling Axios: ""We're having a conversation about it in the caucus meeting tomorrow.""

State of play: The House is set to vote this week on a package of appropriations bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Labor, along with DHS.

The bills would effectively head off a partial government shutdown through September, which would offer Congress substantial breathing room as it heads into the 2026 midterms.

The package was negotiated by top lawmakers in both parties, but the DHS bill — which is expected to be voted on separately — is already garnering vocal opposition from some corners of the House Democratic caucus.

What they're saying: ""The whole fact that they separated it out is because they know that so many of us have huge concerns about this,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Axios.

Jayapal announced her opposition in a statement, saying that while the bill includes new oversight measures for immigration agents and funding for body cameras and inspections, it ""simply does not meet the moment.""

Several other prominent progressives, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), said they are opposing the bill for similar reasons.

The intrigue: It's not just progressives. ""I'm incredibly concerned that the agencies are so unresponsive, and ... these agencies are not in charge of themselves and Trump's not king,"" said Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.).

Gray, who represents a swing district and is a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, told Axios that ""people either start responding to things, or it forces Congress' hand to vote 'no' just to heel these folks.""

""So I could see voting against it for that reason,"" he said, but ""as far as the funding for DHS I'm generally supportive of that stuff. So I could go either way right now.""

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.","WASHINGTON • A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who is based in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb stressed that she isn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order, which she issued in the plaintiffs’ favor.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers had asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Video footage showed Good’s SUV stopped sideways in the street and agents approached the vehicle, one of whom attempted to open the driver’s side door. As the SUV moved forward, the ICE officer, standing near the front of the car, fired at least two shots into the vehicle. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car, where Good was found with a gunshot wound to the head.

Details of the shooting are in dispute. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, calling Good’s actions “domestic terrorism.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called the account “bulls—” and alleged Ross “recklessly” used force. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he believes the video evidence shows an “escalation by the officers” and that Good was trying to evade, not attack.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” the judge wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused the Trump administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in illegal immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds is being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.

“The law is clear: Members of Congress have a legal right to conduct oversight of federal facilities,” Crow said in a statement to Colorado Politics. “I’ll keep fighting to hold this administration accountable and bring much-needed transparency to taxpayer dollars being spent on these facilities.”

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for legislators to be worried that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. The judge had rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The survey, shared with Salon by the Public Policy Polling, found that 53% of Americans believe that “ICE agents are going too far” with their immigration raids, while half, 50%, say that ICE tactics are making communities “less safe.” In contrast, around 40% of respondents said that they did not believe ICE was going too far and 42% said that ICE tactics were making communities “more safe.”

55% of responders supported the idea that the Trump administration was focusing “too much” on immigration and not enough on “on fixing the economy, inflation and the rising cost of living,” and 57% said that ICE officers “should be required to adopt police officer standards like working without a mask and displaying a visible badge number.” Just 37% disagreed that the Trump administration was focusing too much on immigration and 33% disagreed that ICE officers should be held to the standards of police.

The survey also found that 76% of Americans had heard “a lot” about Ross’s killing of Good, while just 16% had heard either “just a little” or “nothing at all.”

Half of the respondents said that they agree that “the ICE officer shot and murdered Renee Nicole Good when she tried to drive away” while 42% said that they believed the administration’s line, that Ross killed Good in “self-defense.”

More broadly, 52% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump’s handling of immigration, while 45% approved of his performance on the issue. Another 50% agreed that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “should be fired,” and 53% said that they believe Congress should exercise more restrictions on the behavior of ICE officers before agreeing to fund the agency. Just 31% said they did not think ICE should face more restrictions.

Students from Taft High School staged a walkout just before 2 p.m., calling for justice and safety in their communities. The demonstration was marked by loud chants and energetic participation as students carried signs along Culebra Road. ""No hatred, no fear,"" was the message echoed by the students.

Temperance, a sophomore at Taft, expressed her concerns, saying, ""ICE should not be in our communities and terrorizing families that don't deserve it."" She emphasized that her focus should be on schoolwork, not on the fear of losing friends and loved ones.

Mars Segovia, who created flyers for the walkout, was surprised by the turnout. ""A lot of TAFT students are immigrants and I'm really scared seeing the violence that's happening, not only in Michigan, but here too, we've been seeing reports of ICE everywhere in San Antonio and it's scary,"" Segovia said.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of an American mother during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. However, those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there's mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations in an ongoing funding debate.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under President Joe Biden helped return Trump to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Renée Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared to 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to AP-NORC polling, from 49% last March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there's a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fc638c1-e064-4748-99ad-ac736c1f6f0f/wirestory_1108b6228c0f088aa85d4c6d8ce744ba_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:04.722854

Free America Walkout organizers urged people to walk out of work, school and to avoid shopping as a form of protest against the administration’s policies during the first year of Trump’s second term.

The demonstrations are aimed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, presidential policies affecting immigrants and transgender people, and increased government surveillance. The goal, organizers said, is to create disruption that forces the administration to take notice.

More than 800 walkouts planned nationwide

Organizers said more than 800 events were planned across all 50 states, with over 38,000 people signed up for rallies stretching from Tampa to Los Angeles to New York City.

At 2 p.m. local time Tuesday, protesters nationwide plan to step away from their daily routines as part of what’s called the “Free America” movement. The group’s slogan: “In the face of fascism, we will be ungovernable.”

Organizers said the action is designed to interrupt normal routines, not just draw crowds.

The demonstrations come in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minnesota, which organizers argue has become a rallying point.

The Women’s March, one of the groups behind the effort, said walkouts are also planned internationally, including in Canada, France, Italy and the Netherlands.

With tensions still high around immigration protests, questions remain about public safety. Officials said they were expecting peaceful protests, and the Women’s March said it has a clear nonviolence policy in place.

Protests have surpassed those in Trump’s first term, data shows

Last summer’s “No Kings” demonstrations drew an estimated 5 million people nationwide. While most demonstrations were peaceful, some clashes led to arrests, serious injuries and one death. Officials have stressed that those incidents were the exception, not the rule.

In the year since Trump’s second term began, the number of protests in the U.S. has surpassed those seen at the same point in his first administration, according to data from the Crowd Counting Consortium.

According to the data, more than 10,700 protests occurred in 2025, a 133% increase from the 4,588 recorded during Trump’s first term in 2017. A majority of U.S. counties, including 42% that voted for Trump, have seen at least one protest since his second inauguration, the data showed.

In two separateletters, lawmakers pressed ICE for details on the technology, including how it was tested, when it was first used, and whether it is legal.

“When ICE claims that an image its snaps and runs through an unproven app can be enough evidence to detain people for possible deportation, no one is safe,” Thompson said in a statement about his proposal. “ICE’s use of Mobile Fortify to determine a person’s legal status is an outrageous affront to the civil rights and civil liberties of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike.”

“DHS should not be conducting surveillance by experimenting with Americans’ faces and fingerprints in the field – especially with unproven and biased technology. It is time to put an end to its widespread use. We can secure the Homeland and respect the rights and privacy of Americans at the same time,” he added.

The legislation would require DHS to establish standards and guidelines for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; prohibit the department from using Mobile Fortify except for at ports of entry; ban DHS from sharing similar apps outside of the department; and require that the apps be removed from DHS systems and made inoperable on non-DHS systems.

In addition, the legislation would mandate the destruction of any biometric information of a U.S. citizen captured previously by the app.

It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.
Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.
A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot.
Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said.","About 50 people gathered in rural Baker County Sunday along the side of the highway in opposition to Florida’s second immigration detention facility Sunday.

The state-run immigration detention center, “Deportation Depot,” is located at the former Baker Correctional Institution in Sanderson and opened in 2025 to hold up to 1,300 detainees. It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.

The crowd was made up of members of north Florida organizations including the Party for Socialism & Liberation, Baker Interfaith Friends, Jacksonville Immigrant Rights Alliance and Florida Immigrant Coalition. Bundled up to fight the cold, rainy day, protesters were holding signs reading, “No ICE detention in Florida,” “Abolish ICE” and “Justice for immigrants.”

The protest’s goal was to promote human rights and discourage the cruelty occurring in the detention center, according to Andrea Mason, a member of North Central Florida Indivisible Group, a left-wing advocacy group. Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.

“There’s the right way to do things, and right now, this is just about being as cruel as possible and harming people,” she said.

Mason said she has heard stories about suspected immigrants being abused and mistreated in detention centers that have stuck with her and motivate her to advocate for them. These people deserve to be treated better, she said.

Mason said the one way she could make her voice heard and incite change was peaceful protest. Her goal, she said, was to raise awareness and inspire others.

A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot. She said they receive contaminated water, solitary confinement and can go up to a week without sunlight.

Her friend and inmate at the center, Jose Antonio Martinez Marino, is depressed and frustrated, she said. Marino, who is from Cuba, has been in detainment for over a year and has no hope of being released. Many are in the same condition, she said.

She said she feels anxious in her everyday life and was nervous to be protesting, as she is still in the citizenship process. She feels America is not a home for her, she said, but she is also scared of going back to Mexico after President Donald Trump suggested military action.

“I don’t feel at all that this can be a place where I can feel safe right now, or worthy,” she said.

Vilerka Bilbao, an attorney for Bilbao Law Firm in Jacksonville and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said this detention center is one of the facilities the association is monitoring.

Bilbao said she has nine clients being detained at Deportation Depot. Her clients come from all over the world, she said, such as Mexico, Vietnam and Venezuela. The majority of them do not have criminal records worthy of detention, she said.

Since November 2025, Bilbao’s caseload has been increasing. There were 200 arrests last week in Jacksonville, she said.

Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said. Her clients have access to regular sunlight, meetings with an attorney and a law library.

However, her clients said detainees are not getting adequate medical help. She said she has clients who need specialists or X-rays, but are getting refused those services. She’s also heard complaints about the air conditioning being turned off and the flu being spread around the center.

Bilbao said many immigrants get deported to third-party countries, meaning countries that agree to take deported individuals if their native country refuses to take them back. She has one client who immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 2021 and is being deported to Ecuador, she added.

There is a false narrative that every detainee is a criminal illegal alien, she said, and that is not the reality. The reality she sees are business owners, nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers being detained sometimes through illegal arrest, she said.

“Businesses are suffering, families are suffering,” Bilbao said.

Miles Gibbs, a 27-year-old Gainesville resident, said he was protesting ICE facilities after hearing about killings and disappearances of suspected immigrants. Though he doesn’t personally feel endangered by ICE, he said he’s worried for people in Minnesota, where a U.S. citizen was recently shot and killed by an agent.

Gibbs has a personal connection to the cause — his family members were arrested in a Chicago ICE protest.

“ICE is out in full force. They’re taking people, they’re heckling protestors. They’re making life hell for people,” he said.

Rebecca Hutman, the pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Gainesville, said she came to protest as a person of faith.

“Jesus tells us to love our neighbours. I don't know — I don’t feel like putting our neighbors into cages is anyone’s definition of love,” she said.

She said she thinks the “rampant cruelty of centers like this” motivates her to figure out how to speak against it.

Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it.
She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.
A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes.
Government attorneys have said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

Plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good's death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs' lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs' motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants' January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" she wrote.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration's efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump's administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs' attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn't shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

""Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,"" plaintiffs' attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

""This is really a challenge to a new policy,"" Richer said.

Plaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS's annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

""This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,"" the lawyers wrote.

Government attorneys have said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.

""The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,"" wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/20/AP26010560028866_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-21 09:57:52.668974

Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.
Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.
The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.","The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday subpoenaed the offices of Minnesota’s governor and attorney general, and mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as it weighed whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities amounts to a crime.

One of the jury subpoenas, shared with the media by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office’s custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to “cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities.”

The federal grand jury subpoenas were served on six offices of state and local Democrats, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

“Whether it’s a public official, whether it’s a law enforcement officer, no one is above the law in this state or in this country, and people will be held accountable,” U.S. Attorney Pam Bondi said in a Fox News interview after arriving in Minnesota on Friday.

“Our men and women in law enforcement deserve to be safe, and that’s what we’re going to do in Minnesota,” Bondi added, without explicitly addressing the newly issued subpoenas.

Walz, Frey say public at risk

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks to conduct deportation roundups, unprecedented in scale, that have led to numerous violent confrontations with residents.

The agents have carried rifles through the city’s snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage, tactical gear and masks, drawing loud but mostly peaceful protests from residents.

Walz and Frey have denounced the ICE operations as reckless political theater that was putting the public at risk and was designed to provoke chaos that Trump would use as a pretext to exert an even greater show of force.

Although he has urged protesters to remain orderly, Walz also has openly encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public to create a database for potential “future prosecution” of wrongdoing by federal law enforcement.

Trump administration officials have accused Walz and Frey of deliberately stoking interference with ICE operations in “collusion” with anti-government agitators, which the governor denies. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.

The hostility of many residents to the ICE crackdown has only deepened since one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago.

Federal officers have used tear gas and other chemical irritants against protesters, and have drawn outrage for racially profiling Black, Latino and Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said officers who broke down the man’s door with gun’s drawn were seeking two “criminal illegal aliens” from Laos who are subject to deportation orders.

One of those men, who ICE officials pictured on “Wanted” posters and described on Tuesday as still at large, was actually in a prison south of Minneapolis serving a four-year term he received in late 2024 for kidnapping, according to public court records and the state online inmate locator.

The man who was wrongly detained, and later released, ChongLy “Scott” Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said the agents who arrested him presented no warrant.

Government agents are forbidden under the U.S. Constitution from forcing their way into homes and other private property without a warrant signed by a judge, or to arrest someone without “probable cause” that a crime was committed.

The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.

Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.

He has pointed to investigations opened in recent weeks against such figures as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to lower interest rates, and several U.S. military veterans serving in Congress who issued a video statement urging members of the armed forces to resist illegal orders.

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Justice Department has struggled in some cases to secure indictments, an unusual rebuke from grand juries given that prosecutors alone present evidence to those panels and need only show probable cause that a crime was committed, a lower legal standard than it takes to obtain a conviction at trial.

Grand juries twice rejected the DOJ’s attempts to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James after a judge threw out a criminal case against her and also refused to sign off on several cases connected to Trump’s law enforcement surge in Washington last summer.

Democrats have called for calm

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have also sued the Trump administration, asking a judge to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minnesota barred immigration agents deployed en masse in the Minneapolis area from arresting, detaining or using pepper spray and other crowd-control munitions against peaceful protesters or individuals who were merely observing ICE activities.

The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” Walz said in a statement on Friday.

Frey said separately that the federal government was trying “to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs” and that “every American should be concerned.”",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2026/01/ICE-Minnesota-Reuters-w-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:08.678440

Thousands of union members, religious faithful and ordinary citizens are expected to participate in a massive statewide economic strike on Friday that organizers are hoping will bring an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Minnesota.

The event, called “A Day of Truth and Freedom,” is being organized by union representatives, faith leaders and community members. They are urging Minnesotans not to go to work, school or go shopping in response to the ongoing federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

Officials from the Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state’s federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, said Tuesday that they voted to endorse the event to protest “against ICE’s occupation of our communities and the unconstitutional detention of countless innocent Minnesotans, including a significant number of union members.”

“They are indiscriminately targeting Minnesotans of color, regardless of citizenship or immigration status,” Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham said. “Many people are fearful of daily activities like going to work, shopping for groceries and sending their children to school.”

She said union members on Friday would join fellow Minnesotans “to call for ICE to leave our state, no additional funding for ICE, legal accountability for ICE’s killing of Renee Good and for Minnesota’s large corporations to stop cooperating with ICE.”

Good, 37, of Minneapolis, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. The shooting was recorded on several phones, including one held by Ross.

ICE enforcement in the state has intensified since the shooting, causing many workers to fear for their lives, said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation of the AFL-CIO, which represents more than 175 local unions and 80,000 union members.

Some workers represented by the union have been detained or are afraid to go to work, Gabiou said at a press conference on Monday. “They’ve had to make gut-wrenching, life-altering choices about whether or not they’re going to go to work, so they can put food on the table, or whether they’re going to stay home, and stay safe, and stay alive,” she said.

Stores closing

Businesses and stores across the metro area have announced plans to be closed on Friday. Among them is Mississippi Market Co-op, which has three stores in St. Paul, joining forces with the two Wedge Community Co-ops in Minneapolis, Eastside Food Co-op in Minneapolis, the Seward Community Co-op locations in Minneapolis and River Market Co-op in Stillwater.

“As a cooperative, we believe our shared labor, time, and economic participation are powerful tools,” Mississippi Market officials wrote in a statement shared on social media. “This coordinated statewide pause reflects our commitment to democratic action, mutual responsibility, and concern for our communities. Acting together is one way we live our cooperative values. We stand with those calling for justice and demand ICE leave Minnesota now.”

Dozens of St. Paul restaurants and bars also are planning to close Friday in support of the strike, including 620 Club, the Black Hart of St. Paul, Caydence Records and Coffee, Claddagh Coffee, Emerald Lounge, Estelle, Hyacinth, J. Selby’s, Lost Fox, Marc Heu Patisserie, Mucci’s Italian, Quixotic Coffee and others.

Craft stores Wet Paint and the Yarnery also plan to close for the day.

Some businesses are modifying their approach: Catzen Coffee, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, plans to pause its regular business model to open for the day as a community space with free drip coffee.

Holly Weinkauf, the owner of the Red Balloon Bookshop on Grand Avenue, called the decision to shutter her shop on Friday “complex.”

“The biggest thing for us is wanting to be in solidarity with our community, with our neighbors who are being significantly impacted.”

Weinkauf said her employees were unanimous in their support of the closure. “Everyone felt that this was the best way to show up for our community,” she said. “They felt strongly that, whether they were paid or not, we should be closed. I made the choice that people will be paid for that day.”

The whole situation already is taking a financial toll on the Twin Cities, she said, but she thinks Friday’s strike will send a message if enough people participate.

“I do struggle with the financial impact to our cities that are already struggling with so much,” Weinkauf said. “It is important. It is beyond not normal.”

“We need to suspend the normal order of business and demand the immediate end of ICE actions in our state,” said Lisa Erbes, a co-leader for Indivisible Twin Cities, which is helping organize the event. “We demand that the federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to many Minnesota residents be held accountable, and we call for Congress to intervene immediately.”

ICE activity is “violating the constitutional and human rights of Americans and our neighbors,” Erbes said, and businesses must “do their part in getting ICE out of Minnesota.”

Somali business owners were planning their own news conference Wednesday in Minneapolis to endorse the Friday shutdown.

Reflection, prayer, solidarity

Clergy from around the country are expected to come to Minnesota on Friday to participate in the economic strike.

Asad Zaman, executive director and imam with the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, spoke at a press conference Tuesday morning at Redeemer Lutheran Church in St. Paul that was organized by St. Paul-based nonprofit ISAIAH.

“Over the last few weeks, Minnesotans have witnessed scenes we imagined do not happen in our country,” Zaman said. “We have witnessed elderly people dragged out of their homes in their underwear. We have witnessed workers being assaulted and kidnapped when they are at work trying to take the garbage out. We have witnessed people being beaten up for the simple act of videotaping and photographing activities. And we have witnessed a mother being murdered moments after she dropped off her child,” in reference to Good.

While the “heavy-handed tactics” appear to be designed to spread fear, Minnesotans “have responded with calm … and peaceful protests, and we intend to continue to do so,” he said.

Clergy are asking for Friday to be a “day of reflection, of prayer, of invocation, and a day of solidarity,” he said. “We ask for all Minnesotans to stay home or to protest peacefully as they are called to do so. We call upon all employers to take the day off so the people can spend a day in solidarity and in quiet prayer and reflection.”

The Minnesota Nurses Association supports participation in the economic strike, but is not calling for a work stoppage or walkout.

“Nurses hold a unique and essential role as caregivers and patient advocates, and MNA encourages members to honor the no-strike provisions of their contracts and report to work as scheduled,” officials said in a statement. “Continuing to provide care is not an absence from this moment — it is an act of solidarity. By showing up for patients while standing together, nurses are protecting Minnesota’s most vulnerable community members in the ways only nurses can.”

The union represents nurses and health care workers, including many who are immigrants or have immigrant loved ones directly impacted by ICE enforcement, officials said.

The University of St. Thomas will continue with normal operations on Friday “to serve its students,” according to a statement from the university. “However, employees who wish to participate in this, or any other peaceful demonstration, can work with their managers and request time off to attend.”

A spokesman for Macalester College in St. Paul declined to comment.

“A Day of Truth and Freedom” will culminate in a 2 p.m. rally and march through downtown Minneapolis. The rally will start at the Commons, at 425 Portland Ave. S., organizers say.

While the work stoppage will be hard on small businesses, business owners “recognize that this is an emergency,” said Kate Havelin, a spokeswoman for Indivisible Twin Cities. “We have to stop ICE. This is an emergency, and we have to deal with it.”

Organizers of the economic strike are particularly calling on officials at Target, Home Depot, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hilton and Delta Airlines to “speak out and demand ICE leave Minnesota,” according to Havelin.

Two employees who were working at the Target in Richfield were arrested inside the store by ICE agents. Both young men were U.S. citizens, she said, and Target officials did not intervene.

“Target and other businesses could post signs saying ICE is not allowed in unless they have a signed warrant,” Havelin said. “There is something businesses can do to protect their workers and to protect their customers because when you are letting ICE wander into your store or hang out or stage in your parking lot, you are not protecting your staff, and you’re not protecting your customers. And that doesn’t seem like good business sense.”

Target officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s a state led by Democrats — including Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket against Trump in 2024. It has a large immigrant population, including Somalis, who Trump has described as “garbage.” It became a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment and civil unrest after George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in 2020. Allegations of fraud in federally funded programs have given Trump an opening to assert control.

“There’s really nowhere else in the country that ticks all of those boxes,” said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, who added that the White House’s push in Minnesota comes with a strategic benefit: the federal appeals court that would review legal challenges to Trump’s actions in the state is dominated by Republican appointees.

The administration and its allies see Minnesota as uniquely recalcitrant and forceful in its pushback to the Trump administration’s agenda on almost every front. Though other Democratic-led cities and states and have resisted Trump’s deportation push and have battled his policies in court, they say the across-the-board opposition in Minnesota — and the uniquely aggravating factor of a burgeoning fraud scandal — has led to the culmination of legal and political battles in the state.

Here’s a look at the legal battles playing out in Minnesota, a microcosm of the nation:

Mass detention of deportation targets

Trump’s most visible assertion of power in Minnesota is the infusion of federal officers and agents — dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” — into Minneapolis, St. Paul and the surrounding region. Courts estimate that as many as 3,000 federal officials have descended on the state to carry out immigration operations,which have drawn protests and inflamed tensions with local residents and elected officials.

Those efforts have resulted in a corresponding surge of litigation, particularly by detained immigrants targeted for deportation, who say they’re being held illegally without the opportunity for bond.

Judges across the country have almost uniformly rejected the administration’s position in similar cases. Cases in Minnesota have been skyrocketing since Operation Metro Surge began, with dozens of new petitions filed each day. And the results have been consistent: Judges, even those appointed by Trump, have called the mass detention illegal and ordered the administration to provide bond hearings or release detainees outright.

Force against protesters

Protesters in Minnesota are challenging the use of force by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and others involved in Operation Metro Surge as well, mirroring litigation that followed deportation operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

That led to a ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez barring ICE and other federal agents involved in the surge from using certain crowd control tactics, arresting peaceful protesters and conducting vehicle stops in ways intended to chill free speech. Menendez found that ICE agents had repeatedly used retaliatory force against peaceful protesters, a dynamic that became even more fraught after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good.

Appeals courts blocked or narrowed rulings curtailing Trump’s actions in Chicago and Los Angeles, and the administration is betting the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals will follow suit and block Menendez’ ruling.

Protected status for Somali immigrants

Trump has repeatedly railed against Somali immigrants in the wake of allegations of pervasive fraud in federally funded programs. And last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to revoke “temporary protected status” from several thousand Somalis living in the U.S. after fleeing war and strife in their homeland.

That move mirrored similar cancellations of protected status for Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and others. Lower-court judges sought to block those cancellations, saying they were authorized on false or discriminatory pretenses — only for appellate courts and the Supreme Court to allow the administration to proceed.

Threat to invoke the Insurrection Act

Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon over the wishes of state and local officials to shore up what he characterized as immigration operations besieged by violent resistance. And in each case, federal courts found the deployments exceeded Trump’s authority.

The Supreme Court agreed last month, finding that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops — typically controlled by governors — into American cities without first determining the “regular forces” of the military were unable to control the unrest. That leaves Trump with an option he’s long flirted with: Invoking the Insurrection Act to send the military directly into U.S. cities.

Trump made his threat to Minnesota explicit last week, noting that other presidents had invoked the Act to quell unrest. But state and local leaders say the presence of uniformed military on the streets of an American city would further inflame tensions and violate historical norms about turning the military on civilians.

Targeting political adversaries

Trump has been increasingly overt about his desire to turn the machinery of the Justice Department against those he sees as political foes, pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to move quickly even when career prosecutors view his preferred cases as weak or meritless.

Now, the Justice Department has signaled it is investigating Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats, and two of the state’s most outspoken critics of ICE’s actions — for impeding immigration officials. Little is known about the status of the investigation, but the probe appears rooted in the officials’ public opposition to the federal government’s aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota and ICE’s tactics in the Twin Cities.

Walz and Frey have rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing and argued they’re being targeted for their opposition to federal policy and views.

Unilateral funding cuts

Trump has also vowed to yank billions in funding from Minnesota over allegations that Somali fraudsters had bilked federally funded programs. The administration has already sought to pull funds from so-called “sanctuary” cities and states, where local leaders decline to assist with federal immigration enforcement, and has targeted nutrition assistance funding in Minnesota and elsewhere.

Last week, a federal judge in Minnesota, Laura Provinzino, blocked the Department of Agriculture from slashing funding to Minnesota for administering the SNAP program, saying that the state had fully complied with legal requirements for verifying eligible recipients. Instead, the judge said USDA had “pulled the rug out from under Minnesota without offering any reasoned explanation” by making new, onerous demands that were virtually impossible to satisfy.

Judges have blocked the administration from nixing disaster relief fund over “sanctuary city” policies, but Trump has recently vowed to pull all federal funds out of Minnesota over what he has characterized as rampant, unchecked fraud in federally funded programs.

Suing over the voter rolls

Minnesota is also one of 22 states the Justice Department is suing to gain access to voter registration files, a nationwide push that has begun to meet resistance in courts as well.

A federal judge in California last week shot down DOJ’s effort in the state, calling it a thinly veiled effort to disenfranchise legal voters.

“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the Executive without action from Congress and public debate,” wrote U.S. District Judge David Carter, a Clinton appointee to the federal bench in Santa Ana. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections our country promises and the franchise that civil rights leaders fought and died for.”

In Minnesota, the battle is taking place before Menendez, who has a hearing scheduled on the issue for early March.

Blocking lawmakers from ICE oversight

A day after the Good shooting rocked Minneapolis, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy blocking members of Congress from visiting ICE detention facilities without one week’s notice. That policy echoed a similar one that had been blocked by a federal judge last month.

Noem didn’t publicly announce the updated policy, and three Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota were turned away when they sought to enter an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis — one of them even carrying a printout of the December ruling in their favor.

The earlier, blocked policy was rooted in an effort by DHS to keep Democratic lawmakers from making unannounced visits to ICE facilities to spotlight what they have described as abuses or unsafe conditions — but visits that DHS officials have described as publicity stunts. But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found that the policy violated federal appropriations law that prohibits the use of certain funds from being used to interfere with congressional oversight visits.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fee%2Ffe%2F87aa85994340a3792e6501ff6777%2Ftrump-one-year-photo-gallery-23593.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:57:05.540381

ICE and Border Patrol officers have used aggressive tactics during the recent crackdown, including breaking down the door of a family's home without a judicial warrant and pulling people from vehicles.

Immigration officers' tactics are ""born of necessity,"" Bovino said, and ""well-grounded in law.""

""Everything we do is legal, ethical and moral,"" he said.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, expressed frustration that advocates have no way of knowing whether the government's arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.

Meanwhile, federal prosecutors served grand jury subpoenas Tuesday to Minnesota officials as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded law enforcement during a sweeping immigration operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a person familiar with the matter said.

The subpoenas, which seek records, were sent to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, the person said.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements they made, two people familiar with the matter said Friday. They said then that it was focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Walz and Frey, both Democrats, have called the probe a bullying tactic meant to quell political opposition. Frey's office released a subpoena, which requires a long list of documents for a grand jury on Feb. 3, including ""any records tending to show a refusal to come to the aid of immigration officials.""

The Justice Department called the state's lawsuit, filed soon after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer, ""legally frivolous.""

Good, 37, was killed on Jan. 7 as she was moving her vehicle, which had been blocking a Minneapolis street where ICE officers were operating. Trump administration officials say the officer, Jonathan Ross, shot her in self-defense, although videos of the encounter show the Honda Pilot slowly turning away from him.

Since then, the public has repeatedly confronted officers, blowing whistles and yelling insults at ICE and Border Patrol. They, in turn, have used tear gas and chemical irritants against protesters.

These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.","One year into President Trump’s second term, federal immigration policies are systematically dismantling the right to due process. From the early days of his administration, Trump has launched a widespread crackdown on immigrants, enacting a series of policies that have vastly expanded detention, deportation, and enforcement while gutting long-standing protections for due process—the right to fair treatment under the law. Due process is a fundamental right guaranteed to everyone in the United States by the U.S. Constitution and underpins democratic governance. Yet in just one year, Trump has turned the U.S. immigration system into a weaponized force of exclusion, harming community members, sidelining values core to the functioning of a healthy democracy, and posing grave threats to noncitizens and citizens alike.

At the one-year mark of this administration’s efforts to dismantle due process, here are some of the core policy measures that have curtailed immigrants’ rights, separated families, destabilized communities, and undermined our democratic values.

The Trump administration has vastly expanded immigration detention, subjecting hundreds of thousands of people to unnecessary and prolonged detention.

As a presidential candidate in 2024, Trump promised “the largest deportation program” in the country’s history. Since returning to office, he has made good on that promise, making mass deportation a core component of his administration’s agenda. Thanks to Congress’s passage of an unprecedented $170 billion spending package for immigration enforcement and detention, the president has the tools to carry out this cruel promise, including $45 billion explicitly for expanding civil immigration detention.

This colossal allocation of funds—coupled with policies to restrict bond, expand mandatory detention, and use racial profiling as a basis for arrest—has funneled more people into immigration detention than ever before. People in detention experience grave health risks and difficulties accessing essential services, with predictable results; 2025 holds the grim distinction of having the most people die in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in decades. Even analysis of the government’s own data shows that detention is unnecessary to deter immigration or ensure people show up for their immigration proceedings.

Nevertheless, the administration has widened its net and targeted more and more people for detention, including new mothers appearing at scheduled immigration appointments, foreign students targeted for their speech, and even U.S. citizens. According to an analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice, more than 290,000 people have been detained since the start of Trump’s second term through mid-October 2025, a 19 percent increase compared to the same period the year prior.

Needing the infrastructure to facilitate this mass detention agenda, the administration has co-opted county jails, federal and state prisons, and military bases for immigration purposes. It has also designated Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for deportations, sent people to a notorious prison in El Salvador, and facilitated deportations to third countries where immigrants have no ties, threatening to create legal black holes where U.S. protections—including due process rights—may be impossible to enforce.

Beyond the obvious denial of liberty, these policies treat detention as the default, pressuring people to lose hope, abandon valid legal claims, and accept deportation orders simply to escape indefinite confinement. Those who stay to fight their case face harsh detention conditions and a high likelihood of being transferred to facilities across the country, far from their families and attorneys. Collectively, these efforts make it more difficult to find increasingly limited legal representation, significantly reducing people’s chances of getting a fair day in court.

The Trump administration has turned courthouses and routine immigration appointments into enforcement zones, punishing people for following the law.

People fulfilling their legal obligations by attending hearings and mandated check-ins with ICE are now being targeted for arrest when they appear at what used to be routine immigration appointments. These arrests funnel people actively following the legal process into immigration detention, where they are either quickly deported without the chance to defend their legal rights or forced to continue their immigration case behind bars, away from their families and communities. This undermines due process by punishing people for complying with the law and sends a dangerous message that participation in the legal system carries the risk of detention and deportation—making communities less safe.

VIDEO:

The Trump administration has militarized immigration enforcement, deploying armed forces to occupy U.S. cities and empowering ICE to implement violent tactics.

The administration has falsely and harmfully equated immigration with crime and “invasion” to justify its agenda, including the deployment of more than 35,000 federal troops nationwide, in part to aid ICE operations and quell anti-ICE protests. The deployments, which have often gone against the wishes of the states’ governors, have been met repeatedly with legal challenges and court rulings against the federal government. Aggressively militarized immigration enforcement efforts undermine public safety, community trust, and civil liberties—recently resulting in the tragic killing of a Minnesota woman, Renee Good, by an ICE officer in January. These actions divert resources from state and local governments to vastly expand the federal government’s enforcement apparatus, place millions under military occupation, and erode the constitutionally protected rights of noncitizens and citizens alike.

By conducting massive operations that treat cities as war zones and use the cover of “Kavanaugh stops” to conduct door-to-door enforcement and other stops in immigrant neighborhoods on the basis of “apparent race” and other factors, the administration is manufacturing a crisis to do away with due process rights.

The Trump administration has bypassed immigration courts, denying people the right to fair hearings.

The president and vice president have both decried the existence of immigration courts as barriers to enacting their mass deportation agenda, even going so far as to call immigration court a “fake legal process.”

The administration has sidestepped the courts and the ability of people to defend their rights wherever it can. It has dramatically expanded the use of “expedited removal,” a process that authorizes immigration officers to deport people who meet certain (and rapidly multiplying) criteria without a hearing. This fast-tracked process makes it nearly impossible for people to consult with counsel, present evidence, or otherwise contest the case being made against them before a judge—all essential components of due process.

Without access to the courts, there are few safeguards preventing the government from permanently expelling anyone deemed undesirable, noncitizens and citizens alike. The result has been wrongful deportations of people with valid legal claims, including asylum seekers fleeing persecution and long-term residents with deep family and community ties. By stripping away access to the courts, this policy dismantles one of the most fundamental protections of due process: the right to a fair and just hearing.

The Trump administration has weaponized the courts and undermined judicial independence to new extremes.

An essential component of due process is the ability not only to have one’s case heard before a judge, but to have an impartial judge. Immigration courts, however, have never been independent judicial bodies, as they are administered not by the judicial branch but by the executive. As a component of the U.S. Department of Justice, they are overseen by the attorney general—who is appointed by and executes the policies of the president.

This fact, which has long hindered the impartiality of the immigration legal system, has been fully exploited by this administration. Despite more than 3 million currently pending cases, the administration has fired more than 100 experienced immigration judges, many of whom have backgrounds in immigration legal defense, and eliminated nearly half of the body responsible for reviewing appeals. Attorney General Pam Bondi, using her authority to refer cases to herself due to the courts’ position in the executive branch, has further vacated judges’ decisions with which she disagrees.

To fill the gap created by their own firings, the administration has loosened the requirements and training needed to be an immigration judge. The government is also turning to unqualified military lawyers without any experience in immigration law to serve as what have been referred to as “deportation judges.” Immigration law is notoriously complex; it is unfathomable that someone without experience and little training would preside over cases that can often mean the difference between life and death. These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.

The Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal funding for legal access and representation programs for people facing deportation.

Unlike in the criminal justice system, there is no right to government-appointed representation in immigration court for people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Yet it is nearly impossible for someone to understand the complexity of immigration law without a lawyer. Research consistently indicates that immigrants represented by a lawyer are significantly more likely to successfully defend against deportation and obtain legal relief. People in detention face even more challenging circumstances, with limited access to a small pool of volunteer attorneys and difficulty obtaining evidence to use in their defense from within the confines of detention.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed federal funding to help people access legal information and representation. It has sought to eliminate funding for virtually all immigrant legal service programs, including those for children and people with mental health disorders unable to represent themselves. While cuts to some programs, like the Unaccompanied Children Program and the National Qualified Representation Program, have been paused while litigation is pending, the administration has continued its attempts to undermine their efficacy and independence through other actions. These efforts leave millions of immigrants, including children, asylum seekers, and families, without meaningful access to counsel.

Without the support of an attorney, people of all ages face a system drastically stacked against them, forced to argue their case alone against a trained government lawyer—a massive undermining of the fairness of immigration proceedings.

The Trump administration has threatened citizenship and revoked legal status from people in the country lawfully—subjecting more people to detention and deportation in a system increasingly devoid of due process.

The administration is seeking to curtail the very act of immigration itself by limiting legal immigration pathways—both preventing the arrival of newcomers and stripping people lawfully in the country of status. The administration has stripped visa holders of their legal status for political speech with which they disagree, revoked temporary protected status from migrants from certain countries, and reduced refugee admissions to historic lows—with priority given to white South Africans. And in November 2025, the administration announced it would halt all asylum decisions, placing thousands in legal limbo. It has even planned to denaturalize certain U.S. citizens—setting a quota of up to 200 people per month in 2026—and sought to eliminate constitutionally protected birthright citizenship.

These actions actively criminalize people who are fleeing violence in their home countries and push them into increasingly dangerous and desperate situations. But immigrants are central to our culture, our families, our economy, and our communities in the United States. Welcoming newcomers and providing ample legal pathways to citizenship, security, and stability promotes our collective well-being and prosperity. Americans agree: polling shows that a record-high 79 percent consider immigration to be good for the country.

Yet the administration is acting against public sentiment and is instead attacking both noncitizens and citizens—whose legal status and citizenship were thought to be inviolable—vastly expanding the number of people who can be targeted by its dangerous detention and deportation enforcement tactics.

The bottom line: due process is essential to our democracy and cannot be taken for granted.

Despite these attacks, people across the political spectrum in the United States are increasingly opposing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and mass detention efforts.

More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the administration for its immigration policies. Federal courts have already reaffirmed the right to bond hearings for many people facing deportation; challenged the government’s position that it can indefinitely detain people it seeks to deport to a third country; and rejected the use of detention in retaliation for exercising constitutionally protected speech. They have further upheld New York State’s ban on warrantless arrests in state and local courts and barred warrantless arrests in Chicago and Washington, DC, absent a demonstration of probable cause. Many more cases remain pending. Members of Congress have also introduced legislation to protect people appearing for routine legal hearings and appointments in immigration court. Despite these wins, litigation will continue to be dynamic, with appeals and new filings certain to continue to impact the rights and legal options of people at risk of deportation for as long as the administration pushes its hardline agenda.

In addition, local and state governments are supporting community members targeted by the administration. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, in the past year, jurisdictions like Massachusetts, California, Baltimore, and nearly 30 others—including many of those in Vera’s Safety & Fairness for Everyone (SAFE) Network—have stepped up to increase or initiate legal defense funds for immigrants. They join the more than 70 jurisdictions nationwide that have invested in deportation defense programs since 2014 to keep families together, stabilize communities, and safeguard due process. Yet with millions still facing deportation alone without the support of legal counsel under incredibly challenging circumstances, more must be urgently done.

The right to due process and fair treatment under the law is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to all people in the United States, regardless of where they were born. The systematic erosion of these rights poses grave threats to the safety of immigrant community members and to everyone in the United States. As the Trump administration acts to dismantle a basic tenet of our democracy, leaders at all levels of government and community members alike must continue to push back to safeguard our democracy and advance immigration policies that respect fairness, family unity, and human dignity.",https://vera-institute.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Special-Reports/inside-the-massive-jail-that-doubles-as-chicagos-largest-mental-health-facility/additional_reading/One_Year_of_Trump_Explainer_Blog_XGraphic_1200x630.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1768586579&s=fe757c4b3b8084dfccdb4300f5375b9f,N,,2026-01-20 23:58:39.143443

PAUL, Minn. -- Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy ""Scott"" Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as ""violent illegal alien sexual offenders"" that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.

DHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

""I don't feel safe at all,"" Thao said. ""What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.""

District of Columbia federal Judge Jia Cobb issued an order denying a request from a dozen Democratic lawmakers on the technical grounds that an amended complaint or a supplemental brief must be made to challenge a seven-day notice policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this month for oversight visits.

“The court emphasizes that it denies plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” according to Cobb’s order.

Earlier this month, Democrats brought an emergency request to Cobb after a handful of Minnesota lawmakers were denied an unannounced oversight visit to a federal facility that holds immigrants following the deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer.

Under a 2019 appropriations law, any member of Congress can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants, but in June, multiple Democrats were denied visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Those 12 Democrats sued over the policy that required a week’s notice, and in December, Cobb granted the request to stay Noem’s policy, finding it violated the 2019 law.

Noem has now argued that the January incident does not violate Cobb’s stay from December because the ICE facilities are using funds through the Republican spending and tax cuts law, known as the “One, Big Beautiful Bill,” and not the DHS appropriations bill. Noem argued that those facilities are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress.

At least 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE through October of 2025, according to a ProPublica investigation that was denied by Noem.

Zoom in: DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that encounters shown in videos posted online are not ""racially based"" and said ""there's a lot of fear-mongering going on by the media.""

Noem said Thursday that officers are acting appropriately and ""in every situation, were doing targeted enforcement.""

""If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there and having them validate their identity,"" Noem said at the White House.

But immigration attorney Allen Orr told Axios that ""at her level, there is no way that [Noem] can tell you about Minnesota, or anywhere else, that every one of her officers are acting appropriately.""

The big picture: A shadow-docket ruling from the Supreme Court last September allowed these immigration check stops to occur when there's a combination of suspicions — including appearance, language, accent and workplace — in response to litigation from last summer's Los Angeles immigration raids.

But this is not the final ruling in the case and the case continues to be argued through the lower courts.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the initial decision, saying it would eliminate ""judicial micromanagement.""

""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent on the ruling.

Between the lines: DHS is being sued in several cases for its arrest tactics used against citizens and noncitizens, alike. Many of the lawsuits argue that using a person's appearance for this kind of immigration enforcement in the country's interior does rely on race.

In Chicago, Colorado and Washington, D.C., lawsuits have stopped warrantless arrests and even led to the release of people who are undocumented but were arrested without warrants last year.

There have been long been issues with mistaken arrests and detentions. An investigation from NPR found that more than 800 citizens were detained by ICE from 2007 to 2016.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Minnesota filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging DHS arrest tactics in the Twin Cities and across the state, particularly stops and arrests made allegedly without reasonable suspicion, probable cause or warrants.

Questioning someone about their immigration status in roving patrols risks violating the Fourth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause, the lawsuit alleges.

The case claims that people of Somali-origin and Latinos have been particularly impacted.

Zoom in: One plaintiff in the case is Mubashir Khalif Hussen, 20, a U.S. citizen who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia. DHS agents arrested him in December while he was on his work lunch break in Minneapolis.

Hussen was grabbed and put in a headlock by agents, who then refused to let him show his ID or a photo of his passport card that he had on his phone, according to the suit.

Hussen repeatedly told the agents that he is a U.S. citizen. But the agents said they needed to scan his face or he'd be taken into custody.

""They ignored both his statements and his documentary proof that he is a U.S. citizen. And at no point did the officers ask Mr. Hussen about his ties to the community,"" the lawsuit says.

Nardine Saad

The US justice department has issued subpoenas to Democratic Minnesota officials, alleging they conspired to impede federal immigration officers in the state.

The offices of Governor Tim Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among those served with legal summonses as US Attorney General Pam Bondi visited Minnesota following intense protests.

US President Donald Trump meanwhile said he ""felt horribly"" about an ICE agent fatally shooting protester Renee Good, 37, describing her death as a ""tragedy"".

Walz called the probe a ""partisan distraction"", saying the justice department ""does not seek justice"" in the killing Good, whose death sparked unrest.

In a statement to the BBC, Frey said the justice department was pursuing him for disagreeing with the Trump administration. Ellison accused Trump of weaponising the justice system.

The justice department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Ellison, the state's top prosecutor, said on X that the justice department sent him a grand jury subpoena for records and documents related to his office's work with respect to federal immigration enforcement.

""Everything about this is highly irregular, especially the fact that this comes shortly after my office sued the Trump administration to challenge their illegal actions within Minnesota,"" he said.

A spokesman for Minneapolis city hall confirmed to the BBC that ""the Office of Mayor Jacob Frey was subpoenaed"".

""When the federal government weaponizes its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs, every American should be concerned,"" Frey said in a statement.

""We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with.""

Subpoenas were also sent to St Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and Mary Moriarty, the Hennepin County prosecutor.

Bondi threatened legal action against state leaders on Sunday if they refused to ""act responsibly to prevent lawlessness"" after a church was targeted during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Justice department officials, who accuse the activists of ""desecrating a house of worship"", have said they will investigate them for alleged civil rights violations.

Tensions have been rising in the state since ICE ramped up operations in Minneapolis this month as part of Trump's immigration crackdown, with federal officials saying they are targeting the ""worst of the worst"" there.

But unrest escalated after the fatal shooting on 7 January of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, but local officials argue the woman posed no danger.

Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks and 1,500 troops are reportedly on standby.

The US Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested 3,000 ""of some of the most dangerous offenders"" in the past six weeks under Operation Metro Surge.

At a news conference on Tuesday, officials for the Twin Cities - the Minneapolis–St Paul metropolitan area - accused federal agents of racial profiling.

They said off-duty officers had been stopped and asked for proof of citizenship.

""Every one of these individuals is a person of colour,"" said Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.

Walz and Frey have demanded that ICE leave the area and the state has sued the Trump administration to block the deployment of immigration agents.

Last week, Trump raised the prospect that he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city.

The disorder erupted after an agent was allegedly attacked with a shovel by three Venezuelan migrants and he shot one of them in the leg.

During a press briefing on Tuesday, the president spoke sympathetically about Good and, having learnt that her parents were Trump supporters, he said he hoped they would still vote for him.

He also doubled down on his criticism of the protesters, calling them ""professional agitators and professional people that want to see our country do badly"".

Trump has repeatedly linked the ICE surge in Minnesota to fraud cases that the justice department says involve mostly defendants from the state's large Somali community.

On Tuesday, Trump said Somalia is ""a backward country, probably the worst country"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d32/live/998ada90-f63c-11f0-a4ca-f58d1380f71c.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:57:41.543738

The strategy is tailor-designed to win bipartisan support for the DHS bill and prevent a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30, when funding is set to expire.
“I think ICE has — its usefulness as an organization, because of what it’s become, has expired.” Liberals aren’t expected to take issue with only the DHS bill.
The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the minibus and the DHS bill.
And several House Democrats have been on record saying they would want their Senate colleagues to withhold their support for spending bills if the issue remains unresolved.","House Democrats are pushing a contentious Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending bill that would allow tens of billions of dollars to flow to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), drawing fire from liberals.

In endorsing a bill that would carry forward a huge spike in funding to ICE, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged it excludes most of the ICE reforms Democrats have demanded since the Jan. 7 shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis. But a shutdown or a short-term spending patch, she argued, would be worse.

“A continuing resolution will jettison the guardrails we have secured while ceding authority to President Trump, Stephen Miller, and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem,” she said Tuesday morning.

The strategy is tailor-designed to win bipartisan support for the DHS bill and prevent a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30, when funding is set to expire.

But the outcry from progressives in both chambers is inevitable given the uproar over the Minnesota shooting, and it was already becoming public.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said in a video statement on the social platform X he will vote no on the bill and will help lead the opposition against it.

“It’s a moral disgrace. It has an $18 billion dollar plus up for the ICE agency. That’s right. They are tripling ICE’s budget at a time that ICE is ripping American citizens out of their cars and arresting and shooting American citizens,” he said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said on X that she “will not vote to give ICE a single cent.”

“No more blank checks for a rogue agency that operates above the law, escalates violence, and erodes our most basic freedoms,” she added.

The DHS bill includes a few targeted reforms aimed at appeasing Democrats, including a $115 million reduction in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations, a decrease of 5,500 ICE detention beds and a $1.8 billion cut in Border Patrol funding. It also strengthens oversight of ICE through the Office of the Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

But those figures are a drop in the bucket relative to the funding increases for immigration enforcement included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And liberals had wanted party leaders to go much further by slashing ICE’s budget and installing new rules governing the conduct of ICE officers, including a ban on face masks and explicit warrant requirements prior to arrests.

Those Democrats say the death of Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three, at the hands of an ICE officer in Minnesota is evidence Congress needs to rein in an out-of-control agency.

They likely don’t have the numbers to block the bill, given the support of leadership in both parties, but their resistance could create headaches for Democratic leaders, who have faced outside criticism that they haven’t fought back fiercely enough against Trump’s norm-breaking return to office, including on immigration enforcement.

“I think ICE should be abolished, to be honest with you,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said last week. “This is like Trump’s secret police that is armed en masse, wandering the streets going door to door.”

“It’s got to be a new iteration of immigration enforcement,” echoed Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). “I think ICE has — its usefulness as an organization, because of what it’s become, has expired.”

Liberals aren’t expected to take issue with only the DHS bill.

The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday rolled out three other spending bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies. The bills are bundled into a single package, known as a minibus, that the House will vote on later this week.

The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the minibus and the DHS bill.

Notably absent from the minibus, however, is an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, long sought by Democrats. It also doesn’t address Trump’s threats toward Venezuela and Greenland.

The health care issue is what precipitated last year’s 43-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month.
Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.
The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.
As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.” The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE.","A 23-year-old Iowa man who has lived in the United States since he was a year old was detained by federal immigration agents and jailed in Muscatine County while being unlawfully denied a bond hearing, a federal judge has ruled.

The ruling comes in a civil case where the federal government’s efforts to hire “deportation judges” — normally referred to as immigration judges — is alleged by the plaintiff to be part of an effort to hire judges whose views align with President Donald Trump’s political goals.

The case involves Giovanni Uribe-Gonzalez, 23, of Hawkeye, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November 2025 after a drunken driving arrest and then placed in the Muscatine County Jail pending possible deportation.

According to court filings by Uribe-Gonzalez’s attorney, Amy Cummings, he was brought to the United States by his mother when he was 1 year old.

“As toddler, he took his first steps on Iowa soil, and he learned to read and write in Iowa classrooms where he was always liked by his peers and teachers. He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month. “His every recollection and dream starts and ends in the Hawkeye state, and his identity, values and culture were forged here shaping him into a quintessential American Midwesterner.”

Cummings told the court that in 2021 Uribe-Gonzalez’s family had saved enough money to pay his $495 filing fee for citizenship under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA). While the government accepted the fee, Cummings alleged, it never fully processed his application and that matter is still pending with no final action taken.

After graduating from West Central High School in Maynard, Uribe-Gonzalez enrolled in a training program for railroad welders, earned his certification, applied for jobs and was then rejected due to his citizenship status. In 2025, he was twice arrested for drunken driving, with both arrests resulting in a conviction on a charge of first-offense drunken driving.

Court records show that after his second arrest in November, he was detained Chickasaw County, where ICE placed a hold on him, preventing his release although an Iowa judge had allowed him to post bond.

According to the court records, David Bindert, an Iowa-based deportation officer with ICE, noted in his written report of the detention that Uribe-Gonzalez had a DACA application pending, but added that Uribe-Gonzalez had “no legal presence in the United States” and was subject to being detained by ICE.

Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.

Attorney cites ad for ‘deportation judges’

As with thousands of other ICE detainees across the country in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice took the position that the federal law providing for the mandatory detention of detainees applies not just to people who apprehended at the border — which is how the law has been interpreted and applied for decades — but also to people who may have entered the country illegally months or years earlier.

The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.

Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.

Despite those rulings, ICE and county jails in Iowa and the rest of the country have continued to hold individuals for indefinite periods without affording them the opportunity to argue for their release on bond. The cases where those practices have been rejected are those in which the detainees have taken their case to U.S. District Court and argued their due process rights are being violated.

On Dec. 16, 2025, Cummings filed such a lawsuit on behalf of Uribe-Gonzalez in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, naming President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and others as the respondents.

As part of her petition seeking a bond hearing for her client, Cummings noted that the federal government has fired dozens of immigration judges and then advertised for “deportation judges” that Cummings argues are intended to “better align” with Trump’s political goals.

As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.”

The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America. Apply today to become a deportation judge and you may be entitled to these benefits: $159,951 to $207,500 per year… DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher ruled in Uribe-Gonzalez’s favor on the bond-hearing issue, noting that district courts across the nation have ruled that such detainees are entitled to a hearing at which they can argue for their release.

The available court records don’t indicate whether such a hearing has been held.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ad-Gavel2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:59:27.450653

Mr. Bovino described a highly organized opposition to federal agents in Minnesota, beyond what he had seen in other places, that had made it challenging to carry out their work.
“We demand more from our federal government — more professionalism, more accountability, more humanity,” said Sheriff Witt, who said she was especially concerned about claims of racial profiling by federal agents.","Three top Minnesota police officials on Tuesday criticized the tactics that federal agents have used during their immigration crackdown and described a region where residents, including those with legal status, were scared to venture outside.

Two of the officials said they knew of United States citizens, including a police officer and city workers, who had been stopped and questioned by immigration agents. And they expressed concern that the Trump administration’s surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota was undermining residents’ trust in law enforcement and disrupting daily life.

“Can we find a way to make sure that we can do these things without scaring the hell out of our community members and freaking everyone out?” Chief Axel Henry of the St. Paul Police Department asked at a news conference on Tuesday. He added that many people in his city “are scared to death” and “afraid to go outside.”

Federal officials responded by criticizing state and local politicians and defending agents’ actions.

“Our operations are lawful. They’re targeted and they’re focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community,” Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official, said in a separate news conference in the Minneapolis area.

The local officials’ news conference, which also included Sheriff Dawanna S. Witt of Hennepin County and Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park police, revealed the escalating tensions between federal officials and Minnesota law enforcement leaders.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly criticized state and local policies that limit coordination with immigration agents. On Tuesday, the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the offices of at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota — including Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul — related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Walz dismissed the investigation in a statement as a “partisan distraction.”

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace than baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” the governor said in a statement.

Elected leaders in Minnesota have repeatedly called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to leave the state, and a lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul claims that the surge is unconstitutional.

The Trump administration has defended its work in Minnesota as necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and root out fraud in state social service programs. In a court filing on Monday, the administration said that more than 3,000 people who were in the country illegally had been arrested during the campaign. Many of those people, federal officials said, had been convicted of serious crimes.

Mr. Bovino described a highly organized opposition to federal agents in Minnesota, beyond what he had seen in other places, that had made it challenging to carry out their work. Responding to local officials’ criticism of federal tactics, Mr. Bovino said that “those tactics are born of necessity” and that “what we do is legal, ethical and moral.”

But in their news conference, the local police officials criticized what they described as a heavy-handed federal approach.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.","Community members continue to take precautions amid sightings of federal immigration agents in Maine, though an increase in operations is unclear as the Trump administration remains mum.

Multiple sightings throughout Southern Maine on Tuesday, beginning during the morning commute with five armed agents in three unmarked vehicles in Portland, have been confirmed by volunteer verifying teams working with a community watch hotline.

Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the hotline has received increased calls in recent days, from roughly one per day to now one to three calls per minute.

“The calls are a mix of people having questions about safety and what’s going on, people needing to be connected to resources, a big number of bad faith callers and the potential sightings,” Torres told Maine Morning Star.

These sightings come after the mayors of Portland and Lewiston announced last week that they were expecting an increase in federal immigration enforcement in their communities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not confirmed nor denied a forthcoming escalation in Maine and did not respond to requests for comment on the recent sightings.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said Tuesday there was an “increased presence” of ICE agents but did not respond to questions about how he made his determination. It’s unclear at this time whether recent sightings amount to an uptick. Immigration arrests have been occurring across Maine, with an acceleration beginning in June as President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda got underway.

The hotline, organized by MIRC and the People’s Coalition for Safety, is built for the purpose of identifying federal activity — with more than 300 people trained as verifiers. Organizers are now working to gather details about people who have been detained. They’ve also raised alarm about AI-generated images and the importance of thoroughly investigating each tip before sharing it publicly.

Portland, Lewiston prep for potential uptick in federal immigration operations

As this work ramps up, communities are taking precautions. Immigrants are staying home. More school absences are being reported.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School in Portland were in a brief lock out, meaning external doors were closed to people entering or leaving, because of potential immigration enforcement activity on Brighton Avenue, district communications coordinator Tess Nacelewicz said.

Chief of the Penobscot Nation Kirk Francis told tribal citizens to carry their identification when traveling, especially near border regions or transportation hubs. Francis had encouraged this at the start of Trump’s second term, too. Citizens of other tribes have been picked up by ICE elsewhere in the country.

Undercover license plates

The Trump administration has begun relying on unmarked vehicles in immigration enforcement, raising concern about people being able to keep track of those taken by authorities and file legal actions without knowing the agency involved.

After receiving a request last week from U.S. Customs and Border patrol for undercover license plates, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows paused the issuance of such plates.

State law permits the use of unmarked vehicles for law enforcement when authorized by the secretary of state. The law also makes it so records for all unmarked vehicle registrations are confidential, therefore Bellows declined to share how many plates were requested. This is the first time Bellows, a Democrat, has paused these plates for federal authorities during her tenure.

Federal agencies can still request general government plates — which in their case would read “U.S. government.” Those plates are generally identifiable as government vehicles, and in the public registration database, they link back to the place of business for that agency.

DHS and ICE declined to say how many undercover plates they requested in Maine.

“DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers’ backs,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

There have been numerous instances captured on video showing agents in plain clothes not immediately identifying themselves, while arresting people who have no gang association nor criminal history. As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

There have also been cases where federal immigration agents detained U.S. citizens. On Sunday in Minnesota, for example, a U.S. citizen said agents raided his home at gunpoint without a warrant, forcing him outside wearing only shorts in below freezing conditions before detaining him and returning him home later that day without explanation. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that they aim to strip more foreign-born Americans of their citizenship.

McLaughlin claimed their officers are facing a “1300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks against them including domestic terrorists following our officers and ramming them with vehicles.”

DHS didn’t provide evidence to support those figures, or for similar claims it has made in the past. The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.

“There are legitimate reasons for unmarked plates. Law enforcement in Maine use them routinely for undercover, confidential operations,” Bellows said. “Given what’s happening in Minnesota, and what had taken place in Illinois, we paused issuance of those plates until we can get some assurances that Maine plates won’t be used for lawless purposes.”

In Minnesota, observers have reported ICE and DHS agents switching out and removing license plates on the vehicles they’re using for immigration operations, which is generally against state law. The state has since sued ICE and DHS over that practice, among others.

Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued federal authorities over this practice, after the state launched a plate watch hotline to give residents a way to report suspected license plate tampering.

When asked what type of assurance would satisfy lifting the pause in Maine, Bellows said her department would need more information from the federal agencies about why they are needed and what they’d be used for.

Bellows, who is currently running for governor, said on Monday she was doxxed for her decision. She said she received more than two dozen threatening phone calls after her cell phone and home address were posted online.

Emphasis on nonviolence comes from all corners

Since local officials announced the suspected uptick in immigration operations, Mainers have peacefully gathered to protest around the state. But, the district’s chief federal prosecutor is still calling for protestors to heed to his warning about violence. At the same time, a so-called militia group with a rallying cry to stop “left-wing violence” is trying to build its ranks.

In Portland, hundreds denounced ICE during a protest on Sunday in Monument Square. In Wells, about 130 people stood out near Route 1 demanding the federal agency leave Maine, an action that corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Local organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive, emphasizing that their efforts to verify activity and provide mutual aid are rooted in non-violence and focused on de-escalation tactics.

“I think there’s a narrative right now that there’s a desire to agitate, but our work really is rooted in non-violence and showing up for community and keeping loving and steady and calming presence,” said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine.

Despite that, on Sunday a group called the “Pine Guard” announced it would be forming to counteract “far-left socialist” ICE critics, including by sending people undercover to anti-ICE actions.

“It is not the role of the Pine Guard to physically confront the far-left Socialists, but instead to expose them,” the group wrote on social media.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

Benson, who was nominated by Trump in September and formerly served as a Maine District Court Judge and homicide prosecutor, wrote, “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is also running for U.S. Senate, has also called for protests to be peaceful — “to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.”

Without pointing to specifics, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition issued a statement Saturday in response to what the group categorized “inﬂammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives.”

“Recent portrayals suggesting sudden or extraordinary activity are inaccurate and contribute to unnecessary alarm,” the coalition wrote about federal law enforcement actions. “Political spin and sensational media coverage distract from facts and place officers and community members at greater risk.”

Increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents have been documented under the Trump administration: smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, and spraying chemical agents. In some cases, immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing.

On Friday, a federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters, granting a preliminary injunction preventing federal officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day.","Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 has been a nightmare for immigrants and for the country. The administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda brought forth an onslaught of cruel, violent policies intended to sow fear, suppress dissent, and vilify immigrants. Taking stock of all of Trump’s actions on immigration in 2025 is nearly impossible. This is, of course, by design. The Trump administration’s goal was to “flood the zone” with a flurry of policy changes to overwhelm us. But in spite of its efforts to quash any opposition, activists, organizers, lawyers, journalists, and ordinary people across the country have mounted an incredible resistance to the mass deportation agenda.

A year into Trump’s second term, the White House’s blanket defense of the brutal murder of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis has rattled the nation. Conditions inside detention have deteriorated so much that at least six people have died while in ICE custody since January 3, 2026. (In comparison in 2024 a total of 11 people died in detention). Calls to abolish ICE are once again gaining steam. The years ahead will no doubt continue to be violent (and deadly) for immigrants and those who support them. But this moment presents an opening to build toward dismantling the enforcement apparatus. Reflecting on 2025 through an abolitionist lens is critical as we develop strategies to combat the ongoing mass deportation agenda.

Although Trump 2.0 has inaugurated a new era in state and vigilante violence against immigrants, the administration’s actions build on a long history of anti-Black racism, criminalization, and U.S. militarism that have fueled the detention and deportation machine’s growth over time.

In the first half of 2025, a radical new order for the U.S. deportation regime appeared to be on the horizon. A series of stark new policy departures sowed widespread panic and threw affected communities and political opponents into disarray. Terrifying as the administration’s draconian actions were, many of its early measures were defeated by resistance, rejected by the courts, or collapsed due to poor planning.

An early trial balloon occurred in March when ICE began arresting international student activists, such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who had been involved in Palestine solidarity efforts. In their cases the guise of immigration enforcement was used to detain and punish immigrant students for what were essentially thought crimes, sending a chilling message about the limits of free speech. These pretextual detentions dwindled after being challenged in the courts and eliciting ferocious public disapproval.

The Trump administration also rapidly moved to start detaining immigrants outside the country. At first, interest focused on Guantánamo Bay, where detention capacity would be raised to 30,000, and in an echo of the war on terror, “high-priority criminal aliens” were to be held.

When this plan largely fell through, the offshore experiment continued when Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in the spring to justify transferring over 200 immigrants to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison in El Salvador. The administration emphasized false allegations that those sent to CECOT, who were mostly Venezuelan, were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, using innocuous tattoos as supposed evidence.

The unlawful detentions at CECOT were paired with a right-wing media campaign featuring Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Republicans in photo ops that evoked the images of U.S. soldiers posing with people tortured at the Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War.

The transfers to CECOT represented another sensational action used to scare immigrant communities and vilify Venezuelans who have, like Palestinians, been on the receiving end of U.S. foreign policy. Yet the threat of mass deportations to El Salvador and the prospect of incarcerating U.S. citizens at the prison have been stalled by multiple layers of resistance.

Despite this, the administration has doubled down on third country deportations, where immigrants are sent to countries to which they have no ties and where they are often subject to detention or other forms of punishment upon their arrival. The Trump administration and State Department have reached out to at least 58 countries, the vast majority of which are on the African continent, to establish transfer agreements for these deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is intentional: “The farther away from America the better, so they can’t come back across the border.”

The small numbers of individuals sent to South Sudan or elsewhere have been vitriolically branded “barbaric criminal illegal aliens.” Yet Orville Etoria, a 63-year-old Jamaican immigrant who had lived in the U.S. for nearly 50 years, poignantly described the experience of being expelled to Eswatini in an interview with The New Yorker: “To be honest, it helped me imagine how the slaves might have felt, going to another land in shackles and chains — that loneliness, that disconnect, that sense of loss.”

Although the absolute number of people being detained offshore or deported to other countries is relatively small, it is important that we challenge these practices for what they portend.

While the Trump administration excels in creating terrifying spectacles, the most significant development of this last year, and one that builds on decades of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement, was the passage of the massive funding bill in July. Congress’s budget reconciliation bill, which allocated an additional $170 billion for immigration enforcement over four years, was an ominous milestone in the history of U.S. immigration policy and the Trump administration’s aspiring fascism. This funding makes ICE the largest law enforcement agency in the country, with a bigger budget than the Bureau of Prisons, FBI, and most militaries in the world. If ICE’s expansion plans are realized, the immigration detention system will triple in size — detaining 120,000-150,000 people at any given time, mirroring the scale of Japanese American internment during WWII.

For years, ICE’s ability to arrest and detain immigrants depended heavily on local police collaborations. Sheriffs’ departments rounded up immigrants, making county jails a gateway to the deportation process. This local dimension was key to building up the immigration enforcement machine. Conversely, sanctuary policy effectively curtailed ICE’s use of local law enforcement in some parts of the country, bringing deportations down.

Now Trump is attempting to create his own occupying army for resistant localities. Initially this took the form of National Guard troops that — along with ICE agents — descended on Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, carrying out military-style raids utilizing tear gas and stun grenades. But after the bill passed, ICE had more resources. In a matter of months, the number of ICE agents doubled from 10,000 to 22,000.

Now, as we are seeing in Minneapolis, where anti-Black racism and bogus fraud charges against the Somali community have driven right-wing attacks, ICE is using indiscriminate force against immigrants, their supporters, and even uninvolved onlookers. Renee Nicole Good’s murder was a preview of what’s to come if ICE continues to lay siege to our communities.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. As Harvard professor Theda Skocpol put it regarding ICE’s expansion and its potential to become a more centralized federal police force: “The Miller-Trumpites are not interested only in rounding up undocumented immigrants. They will step up using ICE and DOJ enforcements use to harass Democrats, citizen critics, and subvert future elections if they can.”

But it’s worth remembering that the Democrats have long enabled this spiraling enforcement agenda. Last time there was a major effort toward comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 under Obama, the proposed Senate bill only passed after a $46 billion border surge amendment was added at the last minute. With citizenship on the table, the Democrats were willing to make any deal, no matter how harmful it was. Their devil’s bargain of accepting more border militarization and more criminalization only served to further dehumanize immigrant communities. The pre-Trump tradition of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement and the Democrats’ failure to challenge the scapegoating and demonization of immigrants has opened the door to the paramilitarization of American life.

The growing infrastructure for detention and deportation remains the greatest threat to immigrant communities. Detention facilitates deportation, and having more bed capacity means ICE can arrest and deport more people. Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day. ICE has increased the use of private prisons and county jails, converted federal and state prisons and military bases into camps, and is proposing to lock up another 80,000 people using warehouses. Another prison boom is taking place, and as we’ve seen with the rise in mass incarceration over time, it is much harder to bring down these systems once they are built.

It has been a terrifying start to the year. Yet the resistance to the mass deportation agenda is palpable. Roughly 1,000 actions took place across the country the weekend after Good’s death. Local communities are building neighborhood defense networks. From California to Florida, activists are challenging detention expansion through local and state level strategies: blocking zoning permits, filing environmental justice litigation, pushing state legislators, and organizing locally. In small towns in Georgia and New Hampshire, residents have resisted proposed warehouses for detention. A coalition of grassroots and national groups secured a victory when Avelo Airlines decided to end its contract with ICE. Support for ICE has gone down considerably. In a recent YouGov poll, 52 percent of people said they disapprove of how the agency is operating.

The momentum against ICE presents an opportunity for building abolitionist power against the system. It could also help open space for making the case against the broader prison-industrial complex that helped grow the detention and deportation system in the first place.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2239258674-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:58:35.259245

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.
A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.
The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.
In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.","President Donald Trump's first year in office has been characterised by sweeping changes to international aid, human rights policies, immigration and U.S. governance at home and abroad.

He signed a record number of executive orders in his first 100 days, many of which targeted transgender and non-binary rights, access to gender-affirming care and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the United States.

But LGBTQ+ people have been affected across the world, with gaps in humanitarian funding, an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, fewer discrimination protections and cuts to refugee programmes.

Here's what you need to know.

What did Trump do in his first year of office?

On his first day as president, Trump declared that the government would only recognise two genders and that federal funds would not be used to ""promote gender identity.""

He then ordered the removal of online government guidance documents on trans issues, an end to DEI programmes and that trans female inmates be sent to men's prisons.

Trump also sought to undo multiple executive orders by his predecessor Joe Biden, including directives to advance LGBTQ+ equality and combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

He reinstated a ban on trans people serving in the military, ended federal support for gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19 and vowed to defund schools teaching ""gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.""

Another executive order barred trans women from competing in women's categories of sport.

He also dismantled the U.S. Agency for Development, hitting HIV services and rights groups around the globe. The administration's review of funding in March confirmed 83% of the aid programmes had been terminated.

The administration later cut funding for a suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ+ youth when it slashed the Health and Human Services Department's budget.

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.

Rainbow crosswalks were removed in Florida and Texas - including a memorial to the 49 people shot dead at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 - to comply with the transportation secretary's instructions to make roadway markings ""free from distractions.""

What impact have the policies had in the U.S.?

A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.

Nearly one in 10 trans adults and 5% of all LGBTQ+ adults surveyed between November 2024 and June 2025 said they had moved to a different state due to LGBTQ-related laws or politics, according to the think tank Movement Advancement Project.

In July, Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn marriage equality across the United States. The Supreme Court rejected the bid in November.

A fresh lawsuit was submitted to federal courts by Texas judge Dianne Hensley, who has previously refused to wed same-sex couples, in December.

More than 200 former employees of the Justice Department who quit their roles under Trump said the administration was ""largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights"" and warned that the rights of all Americans were at risk.

Corporations including Mastercard, Boeing, Deloitte, Target and Walmart scaled back their sponsorships and donations to LGBTQ+ groups in 2025, with Pride organisers stating that funds for their events were cut.

Have people been impacted internationally?

The Trump administration's cuts to global humanitarian programmes and foreign aid have led to 2.5 million people losing access to HIV medication and thrown rights organisations into a funding crisis.

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a landmark U.S. initiative from 2003 to fight HIV around the world, stopped HIV prevention for most groups at a higher risk of an infection, including gay and bisexual men.

Activists in Africa shared how Trump's rhetoric had emboldened anti-LGBTQ+ actors. For example, support for the Ghana's harsh Family Values bill has grown.

Trump reduced refugee admissions by 94%, leaving tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ people in limbo in places like Kenya and South Sudan.

The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.

In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.

Pride organisers across Europe also lost corporate sponsorships in countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Britain and Estonia due to the ""Trump effect.""

Roul held a news conference on Tuesday, marking one year into President Donald Trump's second term in office.

Over the past 365 days, Illinois has filed more than 50 lawsuits.

The attorney general said the state is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration challenging everything from federal funding freezes to ""aggressive and unconstitutional"" immigration enforcement tactics.

Raoul said his office has been trying to combat what they deem unlawful actions in Trump's first year of his second term.

SEE ALSO | 1 year into Trump's 2nd term, here are some of the seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policies

This includes Customs and Border Patrol tactics and National Guard deployment.

President Trump has signed many executive orders the past year aimed at reducing federal bureaucracy, expanding immigration enforcement that's lowered illegal border crossings, and signed major tax legislation, which proponents argue, has lowered taxes for many Americans.

Raoul spoke about the strain the legal battles are putting on his staff.

""Just one day after the inauguration, together with my fellow attorneys general, we filed our first lawsuit during the administration to protect birthright citizenship,"" he said. ""As a proud son of Haitian immigrants born at the time that my mother was not yet naturalized, I am a birthright citizen. So, our first action could not have been more personal for me. As a survivor of the cancer that took my father and both my grandfathers, protecting funding for cancer research could not be more personal for me.""

Raoul said the AG's office has fought to protect voter registration requirements, public health programs, like infectious disease labs, birthright citizenship from being terminated, and funding for critical medical care.

In total, the AG's office says it's protected over $6.6 billion dollars in state funding.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18437855_kwame-trump-split-ap-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-20 19:58:32.590155

“The Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles received a request for confidential, undercover Maine license plates from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in a statement.

“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” she added.

Maine is a sanctuary state, meaning it limits local authorities’ compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) has strongly encouraged residents to stay vigilant amid the surge in immigration enforcement activity launched by the Trump administration.

“To the federal government I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said in a video statement last week.

“To the people of Maine: I know you care deeply about protecting your neighbors, as do I. And I know that many of you are angry about the potential for any enhanced federal law enforcement presence in Maine. I feel that too,” she added.

The Democratic governor encouraged residents to meet hostility with “reserve and resolve.”

Her push for safety comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are expected to arrive in Portland, Maine, and Lewiston, Maine, in the coming days. Mills words follow the death of Minnesota mother Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer. Agents told her to step out of the vehicle, but she instead tried to drive away, and an officer fired shots into the car.

The Trump administration has described her as a “domestic terrorist” who used her vehicle as a “deadly weapon” to evade law enforcement.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/ice_immigration_01272025_AP25027710583865.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 20:58:22.657803

5 p.m.: Kennedy Park soccer games suspended amid ICE worries

A group that coordinates pickup soccer games in Portland’s Kennedy Park has indefinitely paused operations as concerns of heightened immigration enforcement have its members on edge.

Anthony Fiori, a leader from the Kennedy Park Pickup Soccer group, said organizers canceled a game planned for last week amid rumors of upcoming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Fiori said he worried ICE could target the games and members who participate, noting that several of players have already been detained.

He did not know when the games might be able to resume. The group last hosted games earlier in January.

“We’re pretty nervous about the players, of course. And the players themselves are just very scared,” Fiori said on a Friday phone call. “We just really have no clue. We kind of feel like we’re working in the dark here.”

In the meantime, team members are coordinating with each other to collect details, like names and immigration statuses, of players who may be at risk, he said.

“We learned a lot of lessons from when Joel Andre got detained,” Fiori said. “If someone goes missing … we can at least search the ICE database to see if they’ve been detained and see where they are.”

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline confirmed an “increased presence” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the city Tuesday afternoon.

“I know, given the national news, this may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” Sheline said in a written statement. “In moments like this, what matters most is how we show up for one another and that we remember who we are and what we stand for as Mainers: the rule of law, the right to peacefully protest, and compassion for our neighbors.”

Sheline asked that residents remain calm and peaceful and rely only on verified information. He also cautioned residents to check in on their neighbors and know their constitutional rights, and said anyone encountering ICE agents should remain calm.

“Lewiston is a city shaped by people from many places and many stories,” Sheline said. “Our differences are not a fault line. They are the strong foundation of who we are. Every person deserves to feel safe, respected, and treated with dignity.”

1:30 p.m.: Absences higher than normal at South Portland schools

There were an “unusually higher” number of absences Tuesday at South Portland schools as rumors of immigration enforcement spread, Superintendent George Entwistle said.

While no immigration enforcement officers have shown up on or near South Portland school grounds to his knowledge, staff and students have been on edge, he said.

The district, in partnership with the University Maine Law School’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, will host two training sessions related to immigration issues in the coming weeks. Those have been in the works for months, Entwistle said, but they take on new urgency in the current moment.

Advertisement

The first is an in-person training on Jan. 28 for all school clerks, presenting practical responses and discussion about immigration enforcement to the front-line personnel should immigration enforcement officers present themselves at schools. The second training, scheduled for Feb. 24, is virtually available to all staff members, and it will discuss current issues in immigration and schools.

“Things are very upsetting,” Entwistle said. “These trainings are a good way to feel like they can manage anything they have to manage to protect our students.”

Entwistle said his district is considering additional training for specific people, such as social workers, school psychologists and coaches.

1:15 p.m.: Penobscot Nation chief urges tribal members to carry tribal ID

Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis on Tuesday issued a statement on Facebook urging members to carry identification cards issued by the tribe.

Francis said he was not aware of any ICE activity on Penobscot lands or any interactions between agents and tribal members. However, he said, members of federally recognized tribes in other states have been arrested by ICE, and tribal identification has not always proved to be sufficient proof of citizenship.

“We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,” Francis wrote. “News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands. The Tribal government has verified that some of these reports are true, and some are false.”

Francis said ICE agents are inadequately trained on the use of tribal identification and documentation to prove citizenship, but that a former tribal chairman who advises U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is working to resolve the issue.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tribal documents can fall into the same category as a U.S. Citizen I.D card.

Francis encouraged tribal citizens to review guidelines issued by the Native American Rights Fund in the event a tribal member is approached by ICE.

“Our Penobscot Nation has endured many challenges throughout our history, and we continue to stand strong together,” he wrote. “The Tribal Council remains committed to protecting the rights, safety, and sovereignty of our people. We will continue to monitor ICE activities and keep you informed.”

1 p.m.: South Portland schools’ plans if ICE arrives

South Portland schools’ policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and to direct agents towards the main office should they enter private property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

Should immigration officers appear on or near South Portland school grounds, staff members are instructed to stay calm, direct the officer to the front office and not answer any questions about students or families’ status, according to the school department’s policy.

Front office clerks should contact the principal while asking the officer to remain in the main office. The principal should then contact the superintendent’s office to review legal documents and warrants.

The policy also reminds staff that administrative immigration warrants authorizing federal officers to arrest someone for an immigration violation do not function as judicial warrants, allowing officers to access and search nonpublic spaces. The school department’s plan instructs front line staff to collect these documents and contact their principal, who would then contact the superintendent’s office for legal review.

Staff members are instructed to not physically interfere with officers should they try to move into nonpublic spaces. They should instead protect students by keeping them in the classroom when instructed, calling the principal and moving students away from officers.

If there are officers visibly near school grounds or at bus stops, administrators may opt to increase adult presence at arrival and dismissal.

The department may host information sessions for families about “rights, preparedness and available support” in partnership with legal and community organizations, according to the plan. Offerings would include a virtual option and translated materials as needed to support vulnerable members of the community.

Social workers, counselors, clerks will receive training from legal partners about what they can do or discuss and when to connect a family to an attorney.

12:45 p.m.: 2 Portland schools briefly go on ‘lockout’ amid report of nearby ICE arrest

Portland Public Schools administrators initiated a brief lockout at two campuses — Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School, both on Stevens Avenue — shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday morning after learning about potential immigration enforcement activity on nearby Brighton Avenue, district spokesperson Tess Nacelewicz said.

The lockouts involved closing external doors to people entering or leaving the schools, Nacelewicz said, but administrators determined there was no threat to the schools, and the lockouts were lifted within minutes.

“This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” Nacelewicz said. “The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning.”

A video of ICE agents at a Cumberland Farms gas station on Brighton, less than half a mile from the high school, was widely circulated on social media Tuesday morning.

Nacelewicz did not respond immediately to questions about how the district was notified about the possible enforcement activity.

Subpoenas target Minnesota leaders opposing Trump's immigration enforcement

Federal agents' actions in Minneapolis have sparked protests

Minnesota Democrats call investigation politically motivated

Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to ""cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities."" Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED FOR CALM

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation ""a partisan distraction"" that ""does not seek justice.""

""Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,"" his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying ""to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs"" and that ""every American should be concerned."" ""We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,"" he said.

The statement comes as reports of an increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine began intensifying Tuesday, especially in greater Portland, days after officials began to warn of a potential surge of federal immigration enforcement.

Local officials in Portland, Lewiston and Biddeford, home to many of the state’s immigrant residents, have spoke of an anticipated spike in ICE activity — even as the Department of Homeland Security refuses to confirm any such plans.

Below is Sheline’s complete statement:

As of today, January 20, 2026, there is an increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Lewiston.

I know, given the national news, this may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community. In moments like this, what matters most is how we show up for one another and that we remember who we are and what we stand for as Mainers: the rule of law, the right to peacefully protest, and compassion for our neighbors.

For more accomplishments, read the press release: Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the Department of Homeland Security Has Historic Year.","Secretary Noem Keeps America Safe, Transforms DHS

WASHINGTON – On November 5, 2024, the American people gave President Donald Trump a clear mandate to secure our borders, end illegal immigration, take criminal aliens off our streets, protect the American taxpayer, and Make America Safe Again. Since taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump has delivered on this mandate from the American people in historic fashion thanks to the hardworking men and women the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Under the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s leadership this past year, DHS has been hard at work restoring the rule of law, delivering the most secure border ever, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, creating safer communities, strengthening cyber defense, fixing disaster response, launching initiatives that are reshaping American travel and national security, and making America safe for generations to come.

DHS has set the stage to break even more records and make even more history in President Trump’s second year.

“In President Trump’s first year back in office, nearly 3 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, including an estimated 2.2 million self-deportations and more than 675,000 deportations.”

“In the last year, fentanyl trafficking at the southern border has also been cut by more than half compared to the same period in 2024,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “The U.S. Coast Guard alone seized enough cocaine to kill more than 177 million Americans.”

“Meanwhile, we have saved taxpayers more than $13.2 billion here at DHS. Countless lives have been saved, communities have been strengthened, and the American people have been put first again.”

Securing the Border to Historic Levels

President Trump ran on securing the border and fixing the border crisis that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden. In his first year in his office, President Trump delivered the most secure border in U.S. history.

Since May, the United States Border Patrol has released zero illegal aliens into the country. Apprehensions at the southern border have reached historic lows.

In fact, total U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions along the southwest border in the first year of the current administration (90,084) were less than the average month during the Biden administration (155,485). USBP apprehensions over the last 12 months were the lowest ever recorded in CBP history (i.e., both Jan. 20-Jan.20 and Jan-Dec.)

In President Trump’s first year, USBP recorded 95% fewer encounters per day along the southwest border than during the Biden administration, with daily average encounters along the southwest border 1,936% higher during the Biden administration than during the first year of the current administration.

Currently, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the current administration to date are 251. Meanwhile, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the Biden administration were 5,110.

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 9,000 per month since President Trump took office – a level of sustained deterrence unmatched in modern border history. USBP had never previously recorded a single month below 10,000 nationwide apprehensions dating back to 1992.

In January 2026, the border received additional reinforcement when CBP commenced installation of the first waterborne barriers funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.

During the first year of the current administration, CBP also implemented 42 Presidential Actions on trade, addressing illicit drugs, public safety threats, and critical imports.

Through the end of December, CBP collected $297 billion from all tariffs, taxes, and fees (total customs revenue).

CBP will continue to play a central role in executing the President’s tariff policy as trade enforcement and revenue collection authorities and will continue working closely with DHS and other partner agencies to deliver a world-class, seamless, and secure experience for all travelers and participants at the FIFA World Cup 2026. These efforts will include implementing robust security measures while ensuring efficient facilitation, utilizing advanced technologies, strengthening strategic partnerships, and executing extensive operational planning across all U.S. host cities and key ports of entry.

The border wall will also be receiving reinforcement in 2026, with CBP moving quickly to obligate funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July 2025, with over $11 billion of the $46.5 billion in funds obligated to date, for border wall construction.

In 2026, CBP will continue to deliver the most secure border ever and continue to support ICE operations by arresting and removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our nation’s interior.

Ending the Scourge of Illegal Immigration

President Donald Trump promised to end the scourge of illegal immigration and deport illegal aliens.

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers, thanks to the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), CBP, and other law enforcement immigration enforcement agencies. Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are criminal illegal aliens who have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.

Nearly 3 million illegal aliens are out of the country, as DHS has removed more than 675,000 illegal aliens and estimated 2.2 million illegal aliens have self-deported.

ICE and CBP have conducted operations in cities nationwide, resulting in hundreds of thousands of arrests.

In late December, for example, ICE announced the successful conclusion of Operation Angel’s Honor, a 14-day operation named in honor of Laken Riley, during which the agency arrested more than 1,030 criminal illegal aliens under the authority of the Laken Riley Act — a law signed by President Trump in 2025 that mandates that any illegal alien who has been accused of a violent crime such as theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, or any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury must be placed under arrest.

Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are convicted criminals or have criminal charges. During President Trump’s first year, ICE arrested 43,305 potential national security risks. ICE has arrested 1,416 known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) and has removed 1,392 KSTs, and more than 7,000 gang arrests.

Now, in 2026, ICE has the ground running with 120% more officers and agents after hiring 12,000 Americans to help President Trump deliver on his signature promise.

In 2025, DHS paved the way for state and local law enforcement to arrests criminal illegal aliens off our streets in President Trump’s second year.

In President Trump’s first year, DHS secured more than 1,255 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g).

Thanks to the 287(g) program, DHS partnered with the State of Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, the State of Indiana on the Speedway Slammer, the state of Nebraska on Cornhusker Clink, and the State of Louisiana on Louisiana Lockup to expand detention space by the thousands.

This tremendous enforcement of the law has resulted in safer cities, plummeting fentanyl overdoses, cheaper rents, higher wages, and a better quality of life for millions of Americans.

Finding 132,000 Children Biden’s Lost

Under President Trump, DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services have located 132,720 unaccompanied children that the Biden administration lost. Too many of these children were exploited and abused before, during, and after being trafficked over our borders. All told, the Biden administration lost more than 450,000 children because of its open border policies. We will continue to ramp up efforts and will not stop until every last child is found

Putting the U.S. Citizen First in America’s Immigration System

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is restoring integrity to our nation’s immigration policies and has instituted dynamic changes to ensure that only individuals who love America, align with our culture, and share our values, are welcomed into the country. Most importantly, Secretary Noem and President Trump are making sure that any form of legal immigration will benefit the U.S. citizen and does not pose harm to our well-bring and way of life.

In President Trump’s first year, USCIS made history with its fraud investigation, Operation Twin Shield, the agency’s largest enforcement operation to date. Launched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USCIS focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, attempted over 2,000 site visits to homes and workplaces, and completed nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with aliens during the operation. USCIS found evidence of fraud, non-compliance with immigration law, or public safety or national security concerns in more than 500 of cases.

In year two, USCIS is implementing the Department of Homeland Security’s new rule to prioritize the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, which will better American protect wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers.

Last week, USCIS announced a new rule that reduces wait times for thousands of religious organizations and their communities—including priests, nuns, and rabbis—who previously were required to remain outside the United States before returning to resume their essential services. This rule protects and preserves freedom and expression of religion while easing burdens on those who shape the social and moral fabric of the country.

Under an updated policy confirming USCIS’ role as an immigration enforcement agency, agency officers are once again empowered to enforce immigration law by issuing Notices to Appear. So far, they have done so in historic numbers. Since January 20, USCIS officers have issued approximately 196,600 Notices to Appear to place aliens in removal proceedings.

USCIS has begun recruiting Homeland Defenders, who will better support the agency’s mission and bolster efforts to combat fraud and other threats.

Since launching the hiring campaign on September 30, USCIS has received more than 50,000 applications — the highest in agency history. The first Homeland Defenders began reporting for duty in early December 2025.

Within hours of the November 26 attack where an Afghan national murdered one National Guard member and severely wounded another, Secretary Noem directed USCIS to put asylum processing on hold for aliens from every country, implemented a full-scale reexamination of every green card for aliens from every presidentially designated high-risk country, and placed a hold on the processing of immigration applications and petitions for all Afghan nationals and aliens from those countries of concern.

USCIS is advancing the administration’s and Secretary Noem’s goal of ending the abuse and exploitation in certain immigration programs. This includes stopping broad abuse of humanitarian parole authority and terminating the family reunification and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

Revitalizing the Coast Guard for the 21st Century

President Trump’s plan was simple when he became President of the United States. He wanted to revitalize the Coast Guard, equip it with the best technology, ships, and aircraft available, and then recruit the men and women that were necessary to run it all.

Secretary Noem put his plan into action, and now the Coast Guard is better positioned today than at any point in history to control, secure, and defend the U.S. southern border and maritime approaches; facilitate the uninterrupted flow of commerce; and rapidly respond to national and global contingencies.

In President Trump’s first year, the Coast Guard stopped drugs before they reached our shores, kept illegal aliens out of the country, rescued Americans, made the economy work, and saw a recruitment surge:

Record-Setting Counter-Drug Operations:

Since January 20th, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard seized nearly 470,000 pounds of cocaine — enough to kill up to 177 million Americans at a 1.2g lethal dose.

Controlling, Securing, and Defending U.S. Borders and Maritime Approaches:

Coast Guard operations such as Operation Border Trident and Operation River Wall increased interdictions of illegal aliens by 44% in key regions and secured over 100,000 miles of U.S. border. Advanced unmanned systems and intelligence-driven patrols have strengthened America’s maritime domain dominance.

Facilitating Commerce and Rapid Crisis Response:

The Coast Guard enabled the safe movement of 1.8 billion tons of cargo, an increase of 13% from the previous year, supporting an economic engine projected to move $5.4 trillion in goods in 2026.

Coast Guard crews also saved nearly 5,000 lives and protected nearly $1 billion in property through thousands of search and rescue missions and rapid responses to major contingencies.

Transforming Workforce Readiness and Recruitment:

Force Design 2028 drove record-setting recruitment, exceeding 110% of active-duty enlisted goals and accessing over 5,200 new members, the highest since 1991.

The Coast Guard is on track to expand the force by 15,000 members, ensuring a healthier, more resilient, and mission-ready workforce to meet evolving demands.

Accelerating Modernization and Future Capabilities:

Looking ahead to 2026, the Coast Guard will implement major structural reforms, including the establishment of a Deployable Specialized Forces Command, expansion of training capacity, and rapid acquisition of next-generation assets.

Investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will further accelerate capability delivery, ensuring the Coast Guard remains the world’s most agile, capable, and responsive maritime fighting force.

These historic accomplishments are further illustrated in the Force Design 2028 Initial Update, which the Coast Guard released on January 15.

The report details the reforms the service has implemented under President Trump and Secretary Noem’s leadership, and it highlights the significant, measurable impacts these changes have delivered for the American people—including the historic 6-to-1 return on investment these efforts provided to the taxpayer.

Improved Federal Law Enforcement Training

Thanks to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and Secretary Noem’s vision, the American people provided Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) with $750 million in taxpayer funding, more than doubling its annual resources, to enhance the training and readiness of U.S. Border Patrol, CBP, and ICE personnel.

As a result, FLETC provided federal law enforcement with the skills, leadership, and training necessary to tackle the threats of tomorrow and to keep the peace.

President Trump’s first year in office saw FLETC focus on:

Expanding nationwide law enforcement collaboration by facilitating ICE’s 287(g) Training Program.

To date, approximately 18,500 officers across 50 states and five territories have registered and over 12,500 have completed the training, strengthening partnerships between federal and local law enforcement agencies.

Training over 73,000 law enforcement personnel, the second highest number in FLETC’s 55-year history.

That includes thousands of personnel from state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus law enforcement personnel from 51 states and five territories.

FLETC achieved record-breaking training—the highest attendance levels since 2007—by supporting over 1,000 USBP trainees daily at FLETC in Artesia, New Mexico, and demonstrating a commitment to scaling operations to meet growing security demands.

Producing America’s frontline during the 43-day lapse in appropriations – the longest in United States history – sustaining the safety and security of the nation at a time when uninterrupted law enforcement capability was essential.

Enhancing maritime training by developing and piloting the U.S. Coast Guard Opposing Force Vessel Program.

Now, FLETC projects to train approximately 90,000 law enforcement personnel over the course of President Trump’s second year in office, fulfilling the operational requirements and expectations of our training partners within DHS and across other federal agencies.

Ushering in the Golden Age of Travel

The Transportation Security Administration is ushering in the Golden Age of Travel and will continue to thrive in President Trump’s second year.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

TSA ended the Obama-era “Quiet Skies” program, which was used to spy on Americans, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as members of Congress.

TSA launched the “Shoes On” Campaign, allowing travelers to keep their shoes on while passing through security screening at TSA checkpoints.

TSA successfully implemented REAL ID on May 7 and achieved 94% compliance, which continues to steadily increase.

TSA launched two targeted campaigns including the “Serve with Honor, Travel with Ease” campaign and the “Families on the Fly” campaign, and the first-ever TSA PreCheck® Buy One, Get One.

TSA screened a record 3.1 million individuals screened on November 30.

8 of TSA’s 10 highest screening days were in 2025.

2.5 billion checked and carry-on bags screened in President Trump’s first year.

Fixing Federal Disaster Response

For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was bloated by waste, fraud, and abuse. Now, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, FEMA is being transformed, empowering disaster response that is federally supported, state led, and locally executed:

At Secretary Noem’s direction, FEMA has conducted a critical evaluation of all grant programs and recipients to root out waste, fraud, and abuse and deliver accountability for the American taxpayer.

As a result, FEMA has achieved:

Radical Transparency and Contract Management FEMA’s rigorous contract reviews led to the termination of 118 contracts, generating $31.2 million in savings and $82 million in total cost avoidance, ensuring mission alignment and cost-effectiveness.

Historic Recovery of Excess Funds FEMA recovered $8 billion in excess funds—the largest in agency history—rechanneling resources into high-priority operations and setting a new standard for fiscal responsibility.

Fraud Prevention and Investigations FEMA conducted 2,092 fraud investigations, safeguarding up to $1.2 billion from external fraud and identifying 27 internal cases totaling $250,000, protecting taxpayer resources and disaster assistance funds.

Accelerated State-Led Recovery Funding FEMA expedited 106 Public Assistance projects across 9 states, delivering $762 million in upfront funding—empowering states to lead and streamline their own recovery.

Record Disaster Assistance to Communities and Individuals FEMA approved nearly $2.2 billion in Individual Assistance to households and obligated $15.3 billion in Public Assistance for communities and critical infrastructure, ensuring resources reach those most in need.

Modernized Survivor Assistance Tools FEMA improved the disaster assistance process by launching new digital tools—including an application status tracker, clearer help text, guided videos, simplified letters, and expanded payment options. The digitized payment system accelerated delivery of assistance from 2–3 weeks to 1–2 days.

In President Trump’s second year, FEMA will empower states to lead disaster response and recovery while ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Continued improvement will strengthen local resilience when natural disasters strike, and deliver efficient, accountable support to communities across the nation to protect the American people when its needed most.

Bringing Back “The Best of the Best” to the Secret Service

President Trump and Secretary Noem made it a priority to restore the American people’s confidence in the Secret Service by demanding excellence from the Secret Service, recruiting the best of the best, and giving them the training necessary to carry out their mission.

As a result of that focus, which led to a roughly 46% increase in applications compared to the year before. From January 20 to December 18, 2025, the U.S. Secret Service received 91,273 applications, versus 62,160 applications during the same period in 2024.

Likewise, the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center delivered the highest number of trainings and briefings in the agency’s history - more than 364 trainings and briefings to more than 56,713 participants. NTAC training recipients included law enforcement agencies, schools, mental health providers, faith-based organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities.

Time and time again, the Secret Service made sure our nation’s biggest sports and cultural events were safe and secure.

In President Trump’s first year in office, the Secret Service:

Successfully developed and executed the security plan for four National Special Security Events:

The 2025 Inauguration of President Trump, President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress, the 2025 UN General Assembly (UNGA, 80th Session), and the Army’s 250th Birthday Celebration.

Provided Presidential protection during multiple major events, including:

Super Bowl LIX (New Orleans, LA), Daytona 500 (Daytona Beach, FL), Charlie Kirk’s Funeral (Glendale, AZ), Ryder Cup (Farmingdale, NY), Washington Commanders Game (Salute to Service) (Landover, MD), and the 126th Army-Navy Game (Baltimore, MD).

Completed 22 anti-card skimming and electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations in various locations around the United States. These outreach operations prevented an estimated $428 million in fraud loss.

In President Trump’s second year, the U.S. Secret Service will expand its electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations around the country, beginning with a 10-day, five city operation this winter.

The Service will continue to aggressively recruit and hire the best of the best in order to meet our goal of hiring 4,000 new employees by 2028, for a total of 6,800 law enforcement personnel and 10,000 total employees on board by the end of President Trump’s first year.

And it will design and execute security plans for multiple National Special Security events:

2025 State of the Union, UN General Assembly, G20 Summit, and support security efforts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Restoring American Air Superiority

On January 12, DHS announced the launch of a new office dedicated to rapidly procuring and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies, marking a major step forward in restoring American airspace sovereignty – a top priority for the Trump administration.

Drones are transforming industries nationwide, but they are also increasingly exploited by malicious actors. The new DHS Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems will oversee strategic investments in drone and counter-drone technologies that can outpace evolving threats and tactics.

The Program Executive Office has already begun its work and will soon finalize a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies that will be critical in securing America250 and 2026 FIFA World Cup venues, underscoring the historic responsibility of protecting events that commemorate 250 years of American independence and welcome the world for the largest World Cup in history.

President Trump has championed the protection of the country from drone threats, initially signing the law in 2018 that gave DHS Components the authority to detect and mitigate drones. Since then, the Department has conducted over 1,500 missions to protect the United States from illicit drone activities.

The new Program Executive Office will be taking the threat of hostile drones head-on and innovating ways drones can keep us safe from other threats on the ground, equipping the Department with the technology and expertise we need to keep us Americans safe.

Restoring Cyber Security

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, CISA returned back to its mission and remains steadfast in safeguarding the systems Americans rely on every day in the first year.

In year two, as our nation commemorates America’s 250th anniversary and global communities come together for the FIFA World Cup, CISA has released a new guide to empower stadium and arena owners to fortify operations, mitigate vulnerabilities, and elevate emergency preparedness.

The agency also issued three guides to help venue owners and law enforcement safeguard against risks from drones near their events and continues to support pre-World Cup 2026 exercises in host cities around the country.

Already in 2026, CISA started off the new year by retiring ten Emergency Directives, marking a significant milestone in federal cybersecurity. This is the highest number of Emergency Directives retired, after CISA determined that required actions have been successfully implemented or are now encompassed elsewhere.

CISA has co-sealed 38 joint cybersecurity advisories that continually demonstrate operational collaboration in action. By sharing timely, actionable threat intelligence and driving resilience, we help ensure our collective security.

Protecting Americans from Weapons of Mass Destruction

In its first year under President Trump and Secretary Noem, DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office protected Americans throughout the country from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.

CWMD conducted a total of 1,020 operations, engagements, trainings, and exercises across 48 states and territories, including operations to protect high-profile events, including the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, and the Club World Cup.

In the coming year, CWMD will deploy to protect the FIFA World Cup across eleven host cities, the largest deployment in CWMD history, as well as other major events like America 250.

Maximizing Intelligence & Analytics to Keep Americans Safe

President Trump and Secretary Noem are using DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis like never before to coordinate a robust defense of the Homeland.

In 2025, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) nominated over 4,600 people to the terrorist watchlist in 2025, working with DHS components, federal partners, and state and local law enforcement to ensure the Worst of the Worst are removed from America’s communities.

Last year, following encounters with CBP at various ports of entry, I&A successfully discovered derogatory information on 80 percent of the devices encountered from persons of interest seeking entry into the U.S.

This includes Rasha Alawieh, the Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University who attended Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral.

I&A discovered that Alawieh had numerous contacts with known or suspected terrorists, affirming CBP’s decision to deny entry and the State Department’s decision to revoke her visa.

In coordination with fusion center partners, I&A identified and watchlisted Rawy Javier Mogolon Morillo—one of the first known members of the gang Tren de Aragua in Orange County, California.

As a result, the Homeland Security Task Force arrested this cartel associate on September 15, 2025.

Increasing Transparency, Direct Communication to the Public

President Trump and Secretary Noem understand have worked to provide historic levels of transparency and open communication to the American people U.S. citizens.

To that extent, DHS’s Office of Public Affairs delivered timely, accurate, and accessible information to the American through traditional media and social media.

In President Trump’s first year, OPA sent nearly 650 press releases and released more than 2,550 press statements to thousands of press inquiries.

OPA also harnessed the power of social media to speak directly to the American people without legacy media’s bias and fake news getting in the way.

On X alone, @DHSGov made a whopping 1.9 billion impressions in President Trump’s first term. @Sec_Noearm earned more than half a billion with 527.4 million. On Facebook and Instagram, Secretary Noem’s official account had more than 83 million views combined. DHS’ official Facebook and Instagram account had 716.8 million views combined

In President Trump’s first year, DHS also launched the critically acclaimed, groundbreaking new web page, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens arrested during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump administration.

The Best Is Yet to Come

These accomplishments helped usher in a historic first year in President Trump’s return to office. The work, however, is just getting started. Under Secretary Noem’s guidance, vision, and leadership, DHS will continue to deliver monumental victories to the American people.

Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide.
Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.","On his first day back in office, President Trump signed dozens of executive orders on Inauguration Day in 2025, many of them related to immigration.

What followed was an unprecedented year for newcomers and the Americans that support them. Lawful pathways were shuttered, critical assistance was ended, and protections were revoked. Many of these actions were framed as temporary reviews or suspensions. However, they went far beyond good-faith reviews—solidifying over the months as lasting steps to dismantle vital systems that protect and support refugees and others in the United States and around the world.

Refugee Resettlement

Most refugees remain blocked from seeking safety in the United States.

Executive Order 14163 called for “realigning the U.S. refugee admissions program (USRAP),” the system that interviews, resettles, admits, and supports refugees in the United States. This executive order included a suspension of arrivals, beginning on January 27, 2025, and called for reviews every 90 days on whether to lift the suspension on arrivals.

Refugee arrivals were suspended within 48 hours of the executive order. Families that were weeks or even days away from resettlement had their flights to the United States abruptly cancelled.

A year later, this program-wide suspension remains largely in place, with only a few dozen previously approved refugees arriving under ongoing litigation in Washington State. The Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for this fiscal year capped annual refugee admissions at 7,500—their lowest in the program’s history, down from 125,000 in the prior fiscal year—and reserved these slots primarily for Afrikaners from South Africa.

Actions framed as a temporary suspension have become a de facto shutdown of the refugee program for new arrivals, with minimal exceptions.

Travel Restrictions

Individuals from 39 countries are now fully or partially banned from coming to the United States, and many of those already here now face delays in getting green cards, work permits, and more.

Executive Order 14161 called for a comprehensive review of countries with insufficient vetting and screening of their nationals.

This review of vetting standards was supposed to take 90 days, inspiring fear among advocates and service providers that travel restrictions based on the review would begin in the spring. A travel ban went into effect in June, placing full or partial travel restrictions on the citizens of 19 countries.

The administration has recently expanded these sweeping travel restrictions. Under a December 2025 proclamation, an additional 20 countries are now included on full or partial travel bans. Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders were also newly barred from arriving. Additionally, processing for green cards and other requests has been suspended for individuals from these 39 countries—including those already living in the United States, regardless of when they entered.

Rather than careful individualized decisions on visas and other applications, these policies amount to blanket bans on entire populations.

Humanitarian Aid

The vast majority of humanitarian aid from the United States has been abruptly shuttered, endangering millions across the world.

All United States foreign aid was also subject to a 90-day review under Executive Order 14163. Like other actions, the EO went far beyond a mere review.

Vital humanitarian assistance funding and programs around the world were quickly halted. The world’s largest donor, the U.S. Agency for International Development, was largely dismantled, with its few remaining staff and operations folded into the State Department. Assistance to refugees already in the United States through the domestic Reception & Placement program was cut off.

While some of this programming came back online later in 2025, U.S. humanitarian assistance remains drastically reduced—to the detriment of millions in need.

Asylum

Seeking asylum remains restricted, and many people who had arrived safely in the U.S. are now at risk for removal.

Executive Order 14165 ended the ability of asylum seekers at the U.S. border to schedule an asylum interview with the CBP One App. The order directed federal agencies to facilitate “safe third country” agreements, which require individuals to pursue asylum claims in the first country they traveled through after leaving their homes.

Reports indicate that the administration is designating people for transfer to third countries in order to refuse to consider (or “pretermit”) their asylum applications—putting those seeking protection without a pathway to safety and at risk of detention or removal.

Parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The administration continues to narrow or eliminate legal pathways to safety, putting those who lawfully entered the U.S. at risk of detention and deportation.

Executive Order 14165 also called for the termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes—which allowed nationals of those countries to seek temporary status and work authorization in the United States. Despite litigation up to the Supreme Court, the decision to end CHNV has moved forward, ending protection for an estimated 530,000 people.

Executive Order 14159 directed review of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations, work authorization, and parole. Since January 2025, the administration has taken steps to terminate or signal termination for 12 TPS designations, including Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Haiti, and Venezuela. Many of these decisions appear at odds with harmful conditions continuing in designated countries. Afghanistan’s designation, for example, has been terminated despite ongoing repression of Afghan allies and a state of gender apartheid for Afghan women and girls.

Additionally, the administration has made it harder for people to remain authorized to work to support themselves and their families. A policy change ended automatic work authorization extensions, and there are potential plans to pause work permits for asylum seekers—a move that could negatively impact many individuals seeking protection. Global Refuge continues to monitor these policy developments closely.

Citizenship

Litigation has blocked the end of birthright citizenship for now, but the government remains poised to implement the change.

Executive Order 14160 sought to prohibit all U.S. government departments and agencies from issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship for babies in certain circumstances, despite their having been born in the United States. Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide. Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.

On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case that will determine the constitutionality of this executive order. Oral arguments are expected for spring 2026, and the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

The California law focuses on employer preparation for and responses to onsite immigration enforcement actions (e.g., an “ICE raid”), while Illinois’ new law creates employer obligations regarding the employment authorization process.

Specifically, on December 12, 2025, Illinois amended its Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act by enacting Senate Bill 2339. The amendment took effect immediately and applies to both public and private employers statewide. Under the amendment, employers may not:

Impose stricter employment authorization or re-verification standards than those required under federal law

Take adverse employment actions (like suspension or termination) based solely on notifications from federal agencies not responsible for immigration enforcement notifications (like Social Security Administration “no-match” letters)

Take adverse employment actions based solely on notifications from outside vendors indicating discrepancies in employee identification documents

Required Notice

Employers must now notify any affected employee in writing within five business days of receipt of an agency or third-party notification of discrepancy. The notice must include at least:

An explanation that the federal agency or outside vendor has notified the employer that the identification documents presented by the employee do not appear to match

The time period the employee has to contest the disputed information, if such a period is required by federal law

Any action the employer is requiring the employee to take

Notice should be delivered in person and by hand; if personal notice is not feasible, it must be sent via both regular mail and email. The notice must also be provided to the employee’s “authorized representative,” if applicable. If the employee or their authorized representative requests the original notice, it must be provided.

Penalties

Civil penalties range from $100 to $1,000 per violation, with additional remedies in cases of job loss including reinstatement, back pay, and up to $10,000 in civil penalties. Repeat offenses can result in civil penalties of $1,000 to $5,000 per violation. No penalties will be imposed against an employer found to have acted in good faith after consulting with the Illinois Department of Labor or the Department of Homeland Security, or if an honest administrative mistake did not affect an employee’s pay or job status. Successful claimants may also receive attorneys’ fees and related expenses.

Relatedly, SB 2339 enhances enforcement by enabling labor unions and certain nonprofit organizations to initiate civil lawsuits as “interested parties.” Individual employees, job applicants, or their representatives may also file lawsuits directly in Illinois courts.

More States To Follow?

Massachusetts and Washington are currently considering, but have not yet enacted, comparable measures. Massachusetts Senate Bill 2665, modeled in part on Illinois’ Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, would impose an obligation to notify employees of Form I-9 inspections and documentation discrepancies within 72 hours of an employer receiving related notice from a government agency.

Washington House Bill 2105 and identical Senate Bill 5852, collectively called the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, would require employers to notify employees when federal immigration agents are conducting inspections of employment authorization or related audits. Under the proposal, employers would have to alert workers about the results of the audit within 72 hours of receiving notice and could face penalties for noncompliance. The act was introduced by legislators on December 8, 2025, following the proposal of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown.

Perkins Coie will continue to monitor these bills—as well as any additional states’ efforts affecting immigration-related employer responsibilities.

Mary Cavanagh(D-Redford Twp.), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), and Jeremy Moss(D-Bloomfield) uplifted their legislation to protect the safety of Michiganders, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, from the dangerous immigration enforcement tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) that are endorsed by D.C. Republicans. As the Legislature has begun its 2026 work, the Senators reiterated how critical this legislation is to protect our communities.

Unethical, terrorizing immigration enforcement tactics have been increasing across the nation under the second Trump administration. Most alarmingly, the killing of Renee Nicole Good and continued violence by ICE agents in Minneapolis have exemplified the malicious nature of ICE operations and is only one of the latest on a growing list of incidents that have happened during ICE and CBP operations.

“As the proud daughter of a Mexican immigrant and chair of the Michigan Legislative Latino Caucus, I will always stand with Michigan’s vibrant immigrant communities that have long shaped the very fabric of our state and nation. Every resident in our state, no matter their citizenship status, deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and basic human decency,” said Sen. Cavanagh. “The federal administration’s immigrant enforcement tactics are creating panic, not protection! ICE agents do not — and should never — have the authority to intimidate, kidnap, or bring harm to our communities. I’ll continue fighting to ensure everyone is afforded the fundamental right to safety and security in their neighborhoods, workplaces, and places of worship.”

“Everyone, regardless of immigration status, deserves to feel safe and welcome in their own homes, dropping their kids off at school, at courthouses, and getting help as a victim of a crime,” said Sen. Chang. “We must do better to protect the safety and rights of every Michigander. No one deserves to have their privacy rights violated or to be ripped away from their family because of out-of-control ICE and CBP tactics.

Spain is among few EU countries touting economic benefits of migration

Migrant irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42% last year

Rights groups criticise Spain's deals with West Africa

MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain opposes a push by some European Union countries to control migration by opening camps for asylum-seekers outside the bloc, calling instead to focus on curbing irregular migration at the source, its interior minister said.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania, were ""no magic solution"" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways, while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests ""in safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights"" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.

An Oklahoma warehouse in southwest Oklahoma City may soon be converted into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center, part of a larger federal plan to detain thousands of immigrants across the country.

ICE Targets 16 Cities Nationwide

Oklahoma City is reportedly one of 16 cities under consideration by ICE for processing and detention sites. The plan, first reported by The Washington Post, would convert warehouses into one large detention center and 16 smaller processing facilities to speed up deportations.

State Senator Raises Concerns About Lack of Transparency

State Senator Carri Hicks (D–Oklahoma City) says she recently learned about the plan and is alarmed by the lack of transparency at both the local and state levels.

“This is not a rumor. It is a developed plan and it’s being executed,” she said. “And there has been no transparency and no accountability either at the local level, municipal level or the state level. And I think that should concern every Oklahoman.”

Proposed Site Near Residential Neighborhood

A letter from the Department of Homeland Security to the city’s planning commission reportedly outlines plans to convert a more than 400,000 square foot warehouse at 2800 South Council into a 1,500-bed ICE processing center.

The site is less than two miles from Western Heights Public School, raising concerns among residents and lawmakers.

Community Impact: Fear and Safety Concerns

Senator Hicks says the proposed facility could create fear and anxiety among families in the nearby community.

“It brings a lot of fear to the students and to the families… because we’ve seen bold actions that are profiling folks based on their skin color.” She also warns that a processing center could strain local resources such as public safety.

What Would the Facility Include?

If approved, the building would be redesigned to include:

Detention Space

Offices

Restrooms

Cafeteria

Medical space

Visitor areas

Lawmaker Calls for Public Action

Senator Hicks has taken to TikTok and public forums to encourage citizens to speak out and contact lawmakers.

“We need to continue to put people over politics and tell Washington that this unilateral decision will not be tolerated in our community.”

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.
By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.
Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.
Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.","At least 31 people died in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high, as President Trump's mass-detention surge strains a system already under fire for dangerous conditions.

Why it matters: Immigrants rights groups warn deaths will keep rising as the administration floods ICE with more cash — and that the agency's facilities may not be equipped to handle the influx of detained people.

The Trump administration's policy of limiting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities has exacerbated those fears, fueling an impeachment push against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

By the numbers: The 2025 death toll nearly tripled from the 11 deaths in 2024, according to an Axios review of ICE news releases.

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.

By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.

Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.

The big picture: Outrage at ICE hit a new peak after an agent shot and killed a 37-year-old mother in Minneapolis earlier this month, intensifying alarm among lawmakers and protesters who were already demanding answers about deteriorating conditions inside detention centers.

""We've been warning about this for over a year, that conditions have been deteriorating, that deaths are climbing, and now we're seeing that,"" Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the Detention Watch Network tells Axios.

""We will likely see many more deaths if things continue as they have.""

Zoom in: Amnesty International reported in December that people held at one center described ""poor quality food, extreme temperatures, permanent lighting, and limited access to clean water.""

At another facility, the ACLU says people reported being denied insulin and disability accommodations, blocked from seeing lawyers and forced to use bathrooms with sewage bubbling up from drains.

What they're saying: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told Axios that there was ""no spike in deaths"" in ICE custody in 2025, arguing the death rate per person has remained stable.

""Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. All detainees are receiving three meals a day that are certified by dietitians,"" they said.

DHS says it screens everyone for medical, dental and mental health needs within 12 hours of arrival, and conducts a full health assessment within two weeks. Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

What we're watching: Congress requires ICE to publish death reports within 90 days, but ICE has not published one since the end of September, according to an Axios review of agency press releases.

DHS did not answer Axios' questions about when it would update the tracker.

In one of his last acts as New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy on Monday signed one of three bills designed to protect immigrants from federal immigration raids. Murphy declined to sign two other measures, including one that would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, first implemented by then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in 2018.

Murphy declines to codify Immigrant Trust Directive and sign Privacy Protection Act

Murphy said he was concerned that codifying the Immigrant Trust Directive would open up the Garden State to a new court challenge that would go before judges who may not render the same decision as when Grewal’s original directive survived court challenges.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop,” he said in a statement. “Re-opening the door to judiciary scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger.”

Murphy said his administration found “a drafting oversight” on the Privacy Protection Act that “could create significant complications when it comes to advancing our shared goal of protecting New Jersey’s immigrant communities.”

“I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session,” he said in a statement. Murphy is leaving the Legislature with recommended amendments to the bill, hoping that the measures would be reintroduced in the new session.

Murphy did not veto the two bills outright. He declined to sign them into law, allowing them to expire because they were passed within the last 10 days of the legislative session, known as a “pocket veto.”

Immigrant advocates say they are disappointed

The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement Tuesday that Murphy “walked away from his promise to protect immigrant families across the state.”

“He does so amid an intensification of immigration enforcement and detention in New Jersey,” the group said.

There have been reports of ICE raids taking place in Atlantic City and Camden within the last month.

“At a moment that demanded courage, Gov. Murphy chose caution,” said Viri Martinez, deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.

She added that “fear of the Trump administration” is the only way to describe why Murphy declined to sign the legislation.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the pocket vetoes have left New Jersey “without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities.”

“These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy,” he said, in a statement. “We call on Gov.-elect Sherrill, her administration and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement.”

Murphy signs Safe Communities Act

The governor said the state was reaffirming “our longstanding commitment to ensuring the people of New Jersey — particularly our immigrant families — are safe, secure, and supported in navigating their daily lives easily and confidently.”

“Public spaces such as houses of worship, schools, hospitals, and courthouses are places of trust that should welcome and safeguard every member of society,” he said in a statement. “Whether you’re praying in a church, studying in school, receiving medical care at a hospital, or seeking legal relief, no one should live in fear or uncertainty or be deterred from seeking essential services due to their immigration status.”

The Safe Communities Act, which takes effect immediately, requires the attorney general to propose policies on how to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they visit sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.

The law also requires certain government departments and agencies to adopt the policies within 180 days of being issued. Policies must be equal to the attorney general’s model or provide greater protections.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov-murphy-ap-2026-01-08.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:58:33.795449

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding.
The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.
California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month.
Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data.","In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.

The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.

Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.

The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.

The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.

But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.

Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.

But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.

Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”

“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.

Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.

In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.

“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.

“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”

An about-face

Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.

The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.

“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”

That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.

The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.

ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”

Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.

California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.

Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.

She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”

States step up

In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.

For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.

Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.

“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”

In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.

In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

“We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy.","Washington, D.C. – One year into the second administration of Donald Trump, the courts have served as a critical guardrail against the harmful excesses of the Trump-Vance administration according to a new analysis released by leading pro-democracy legal organization Democracy Forward today.

The Trump-Vance administration has faced more than 600 lawsuits from people and communities across the nation and has lost in court more than 70% of the time. The administration has faced losses in front of courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, and President Trump himself, with less than 5% of these cases going to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Over the past year, the nation has been reminded of the resilience and determination of the American people. As powerful institutions have stayed silent or, worse, collaborated in what is an autocratic power grab unfolding in our nation, the people have stepped forward, including in the courts where the people have filed–and won–hundreds of legal cases. At Democracy Forward, we are proud to be shoulder to shoulder with people and communities across the country, as well as with the nation’s legal community, in defending people and the rule of law against what are existential threats to the wellbeing of people and our nation’s present and future,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the devastation and pain that the Trump-Vance administration continues to cause is immoral and unjustifiable, we find hope in the people’s determination to resist this autocratic powergrab.”

Critical pro-democracy court victories that have been achieved by public interest organizations, civil rights and civil liberties advocates, state attorneys general, private practice lawyers, and cities and counties over the past year – and that remain in place – include:

Blocking the administration’s nationwide freeze on federal funding and essential services;

Blocking the administration’s deployment of the National Guard in states and cities across the nation;

Blocking the administration’s retaliation against law firms, civic institutions, associations, and non-profit organizations;

Blocking the administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deprive people of due process;

Blocking the administration’s attempt to defund educational institutions that do not align with the White House’s views;

Blocking a number of the administration’s anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility initiatives;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to reverse the Constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship;

Blocking key provisions of the administration’s so-called “election integrity” Executive Order;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to deprive 42 million Americans of supplemental nutritional assistance (SNAP);

Blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive 2.2 million people of health care, raise costs for working families, and undermine the Affordable Care Act’s core protections; and

Blocking attempts to undermine the free press –whether through court orders that blocked attempts to decimate the Voice of America or blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive press of access to public spaces.

Many of these victories have been achieved through a broad coalition of public interest organizations and pro-democracy state attorneys general. Democracy 2025, the strategic legal network of 675+ organizations housed at Democracy Forward, has been credited with coordinating the largest and most effective legal strategy against unlawful administrative action in modern history. Democracy 2025 is the strategic hub to protect people and their rights against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to unlawfully strip away freedoms and prosperity. The effort has been credited with filling the gap that was left when a number of large elite law firms pulled back from their pro-bono work and/or capitulated to the White House’s demands.

Democracy Forward in the past year alone has taken more than 400 legal actions to stop executive branch excesses, including through filing more than 150 lawsuits, initiating more than 250 public records investigations, and filing numerous supportive friend-of-the court briefs. Democracy Forward has also submitted more than 1,700 Freedom of Information Act requests and other demands since January 2025.

In addition to Democracy 2025, Democracy Forward has launched a number of additional collaborative projects to build further support for the pro-democracy movement – both inside and outside of the courts. Those include:

Civil Service Strong, a collaborative effort by civil society, non-partisan good government and watchdog organizations, lawyers, and unions to ensure our nation’s civil service is able to continue to serve the American people and our Constitution, deliver for our nation, and support our communities.

Democracy Works 250, an innovative and collaborative effort to reimagine and build foundations for a people-centered government and democracy, including through a nationwide listening project to catalogue the expectations and experiences of the American people and through optimizing the expertise of former civil servants and fired federal workers to contribute to plans to rebuild government.

We Hold These Truths, a nationwide campaign dedicated to promoting unity and cross-ideological support for the five non-negotiables of American Democracy: voting and elections, personal freedom, equality, due process, and the rule of law.

Together for Democracy, an initiative to build community and encourage courageous action across the nation.

“As the threats from the Trump-Vance regime continue to accelerate, we are continuing to expand our efforts to protect people, the Constitution, and our nation. We are proud of the historic, peaceful, and direct actions that people and communities have taken over the last year to protect themselves, their neighbors, and our democracy – both inside the courts and outside of the courtroom. Courage is the new currency. Whether it’s Day 1, Day 365, or Day 1,000, we will continue to meet this administration in court to protect our communities and our democracy,” Perryman added. “We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy. It is not too late to choose the right side of history.”",https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:56.276148

Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House:

Job growth slowed, and the unemployment rate crept upward. Job-seekers now outnumber job openings.

Price increases slowed according to the most commonly watched number. But they worsened according to the measure preferred by the Federal Reserve.

Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Real weekly earnings of private-sector workers rose 1.4%.

Economists estimate the economy grew 1.8%.

Consumer sentiment declined.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4%, while refugee admissions declined 98%.

The international trade deficit decreased only slightly, by 0.9%.

The stock market continued to set new records.

The number of people receiving federal food assistance went down by about 1.2 million.

Oil production went up 2.5%, while oil imports dropped 6.9%. Carbon emissions increased slightly.

The number of murders nationwide continued to decline, a trend that began in 2022.

The federal debt held by the public rose about 6.7%.

Analysis

Now that Trump has been back in office for one year, we’re publishing our first “Trump’s Numbers” article of his second term. That’s the schedule we have followed for these reports, which we launched in 2012. We wait a year when a new president is inaugurated to allow for the accumulation of some data on most of these metrics.

Going forward, we’ll provide quarterly updates throughout Trump’s term, as we did for his predecessors, and we’ll be able to include statistics that are missing from this report — household income, poverty and health insurance — once the data are released.

In a Jan. 13 speech, Trump himself cited “the numbers” for his economic record, making a healthy, and incorrect, use of superlatives. “By almost every metric, we have quickly gone from the worst numbers on record to the best and strongest numbers,” he said. “Just based on the numbers.”

While that’s clearly not accurate for “almost every metric,” the idea behind these articles isn’t to fact-check specific claims; rather, we simply provide the numbers. They may be expected or surprising, good or bad, depending on one’s point of view. We leave those opinions to readers, and we make no judgments as to how much credit or blame a president deserves for these measures.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed and unemployment crept up during Trump’s second term. The number of unemployed now exceeds the number of job openings.

Employment — Employment continued growing during Trump’s first 11 months in office, but much more slowly than it had in the previous 11 months.

The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show an increase of 473,000 in total nonfarm employment between January and December 2025. That’s barely more than one-quarter of the 1,782,000 jobs added between February 2024 and January 2025, when Trump began his current term.

(A note of caution: BLS has announced it will revise its monthly job figures substantially downward for March because its annual “benchmarking” study indicated its monthly survey had overcounted the number of jobs that month by 911,000. Updated figures going back to March 2024 are scheduled to be released in February along with the regular monthly employment report.)

Much of the sluggishness under Trump is due to the president’s deliberate slashing of the federal workforce. Federal government employment has fallen by 277,000, or 9.2%, since he took office.

Looking only at the private sector — excluding federal, state and local government workers — 654,000 jobs were added during Trump’s term so far. But that’s still less than half the 1,414,000 added in the preceding 11 months.

Back in August, Trump reacted to disappointing job-growth figures by calling them “rigged” and “phony” even though we found no evidence of that and the White House offered none. Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated as her replacement E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump withdrew that nomination amid much criticism at the end of September and has yet to name a permanent replacement.

Meanwhile BLS reported a gain of only 50,000 jobs in the month of December. That’s even lower than the initial report of a 73,000 gain in July that prompted Trump to fire the BLS chief. The July gain has since been revised downward to 72,000.

Manufacturing Jobs — The economy continued to lose manufacturing jobs. During Trump’s first 11 months the loss was 63,000. That followed a loss of 98,000 in the preceding 11 months.

Labor Force Participation — The labor force participation rate declined a bit in Trump’s second term, dropping from 62.6% to 62.4%.

The rate is the portion of the population over age 16 that is working or seeking work. It generally has been in a long decline as the population ages and people retire.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate has remained well below the historical norm under Trump, but has gone up slightly since he took office. It was 4.0% in January 2025, and most recently was 4.4% in December.

The median rate for all months since 1948 is 5.5%.

Job Openings — The number of people officially listed as unemployed rose by 638,000 during Trump’s first 11 months, while the number of job openings declined by 616,000. There are now 7.5 million unemployed and seeking work, but only 7.1 million openings. When Trump took office, job opportunities outnumbered job-seekers.

Wages and Inflation

CPI — Trump campaigned on a promise to reduce inflation, and since he took office it has slowed little. Or maybe not. By one important measure it has worsened.

In the 12 months before Trump took office the Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited measure of inflation, rose 3.0%. And in the most recent BLS report, the 12-month increase was 2.7%.

Over Trump’s first 11 months in office, the CPI went up 2.18%.

One particularly bright spot: The often volatile price of gasoline has eased. The national average price for regular gasoline at the pump was $3.11 the week Trump was sworn in for the second time, and had dropped to $2.78 by the week ending Jan. 12, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Inflation was much worse in 2022, when the 12-month CPI increase spiked at 9.1% in June. That was the largest 12-month increase in over 40 years. But inflation had slowed markedly by the time Trump came in.

Still, inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve would like, and it’s going in the wrong direction as measured by the Fed’s preferred metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The central bank’s target is a 2% annual increase in the PCE. When Trump took office, the 12-month increase in the PCE was 2.5%. But the most recent report put the 12-month increase at 2.8%.

That was for the period ending in September. Not only do the PCE figures take longer to gather than the CPI, they have been delayed by the recent government shutdown. The next PCE release is now scheduled for Jan. 22 and will cover both October and November.

Wages — Wage increases accelerated under Trump, even adjusted for inflation.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.4% during Trump’s first 11 months. They were rising when he took office, but had only gone up 0.5% in the preceding 11 months.

Those figures include professionals, executives and supervisory employees, whose pay is normally higher. But rank-and-file wage earners are seeing gains just as rapid as those of their bosses. For private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, real average earnings also rose 1.4% under Trump, after a 1.0% rise in the preceding period.

Economic Growth

After a weak first quarter, the economy showed surprising resilience in Trump’s first year back in office – largely on the strength of substantial artificial intelligence investments and household spending.

Although the first official annual estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis isn’t due to be released until Feb. 20, BEA data available so far show that real gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6% in the first three months of 2025 but then grew by 3.8% in the second quarter and 4.3% in the third quarter.

The reported third-quarter growth was the largest in two years, when the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.7%. Fourth quarter growth, which also won’t be released until Feb. 20, may be even higher. As of Jan. 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 5.3%.

“This strong growth came despite the adverse trade and immigration shocks the economy has absorbed over the past year,” resulting in a “soft labor market,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, wrote in December after the third-quarter figures were released. “That interplay — a surging economy and a soft labor market — is likely to be the major economic narrative next year.”

Brusuelas described the economy as a “resilient beast.” He attributed the third-quarter growth to “[h]ousehold consumption driven by higher-income consumers and AI-related investment,” which he wrote “accounted for just under 70% of total growth during the [third] quarter.”

For the full year, Federal Reserve Board members and bank presidents expect growth to come in at between 1.5% and 2%, according to estimates released Dec. 10. Their median projection was 1.7%. Similarly, economists surveyed in October by the National Association for Business Economics estimated 1.8% growth in 2025.

Consumer Sentiment

When Trump took office, consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expressed concern about unemployment and inflation and uncertainty about the potential impact of Trump’s economic agenda.

“Concerns over the future trajectory of inflation were visible throughout the interviews and were tied to beliefs about anticipated policies like tariffs,” Joanne W. Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in a press release last January, adding that “consumers of all political leanings will continue to refine their views as Trump’s policies are clarified and implemented.”

A year ago, the university’s survey showed that the consumer sentiment was 71.7. Since then, consumer confidence has precipitously declined in subsequent surveys and remains stubbornly low.

The university’s preliminary Index of Consumer Sentiment for January was 54 – 17.7 points lower than it was when Trump took office. By contrast, consumer sentiment never dropped below 71.8 in Trump’s first term, despite the economic turmoil caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Although those surveyed perceived some “modest improvement” in the economy in the last two months, consumer sentiment “remains nearly 25% below last January’s reading,” Hsu said. Consumers “continue to be focused primarily on kitchen table issues, like high prices and softening labor markets.”

In its most recent Consumer Confidence Survey, the Conference Board — a research organization with more than 2,000 member companies — also reported that consumer confidence declined for the fifth straight month in December.

“Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the [government] shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year’s January peak,” Dana M. Peterson, chief economist of the Conference Board, said in a Dec. 23 press release.

Home Prices & Homeownership

Homeownership — Homeownership rates have declined slightly since Trump became president.

The homeownership rate, which the Census Bureau measures as the percentage of “occupied housing units that are owner-occupied,” was 65.3% in the third quarter of 2025 — 0.4 points below the 65.7% rate during Biden’s last quarter in office.

Although mortgage rates eased in 2025, the homeownership rate in the third quarter “remained below last year’s pace because of ongoing affordability pressures,” according to Realtor.com.

“Persistent affordability challenges and a shortage of reasonably priced homes have kept the rate from rising more meaningfully, though recent inventory gains, softer prices, and easing mortgage rates appear to be helping some previously sidelined households enter the market,” Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones said in a Dec. 12 article on the company’s website.

The highest homeownership rate on record was 69.2% in 2004, when George W. Bush was president. But millions of Americans lost their homes during the Great Recession, a financial crisis triggered by a housing market crash.

“Following record-high homeownership rates before the 2008 housing and financial crisis, homeownership rates have remained relatively static at the current rate of 65 percent,” HUD’s policy and research arm wrote in a July report on the history of homeownership in the U.S.

Home Prices — Home prices, which soared to new highs under Biden, slowed in Trump’s first year, as mortgage rates continued to fall.

The national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in December was $409,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was 2.9% higher than it was in January, when Biden left office.

Looked at another way: The median sales price in December was only 0.24% higher year-over-year.

“2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release. “However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.”

The Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates three times in 2024. After a pause, the Fed cut rates three more times in 2025 – lowering rates last year by a full percentage point since September. While that’s not directly tied to mortgage rates, it can affect how banks set their loan rates.

As of Jan. 8, the average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.16% — down from 6.96% for the week ending Jan. 23, 2025, according to Freddie Mac. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025.

Immigration

In his first year in office, Trump has followed through on his signature campaign promise to — as he puts it — “close the border,” with numerous executive actions that have dramatically reshaped immigration policy and enforcement.

“The border is totally secure,” Trump told reporters on Jan. 11.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4% during Trump’s first full 11 months in office, compared with the same period in 2024, according to the most recent figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The monthly average (7,255) was at a low not seen since the early 1960s.

Calculating the change in border apprehensions is the method we’ve used as a proxy to measure illegal border crossings for our Numbers stories going back to President Barack Obama. But in Trump’s case, that dramatic drop tells only part of the story of the sweeping immigration policy changes that the Migration Policy Institute describes as “unprecedented in their breadth and reach.”

“While some efforts have stalled or not yet met the White House’s lofty goals, the administration has dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants in the country, deter unauthorized border arrivals, make the status of many legally resident immigrants more tenuous, and impose obstacles for lawful entry of large swaths of international travelers and would-be immigrants,” MPI’s Muzaffar Chishti, Kathleen Bush-Joseph and Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh wrote in their Jan. 13 article, “Unleashing Power in New Ways: Immigration in the First Year of Trump 2.0.” The “net change,” the authors wrote, “has been dizzying in its scope and speed.”

The Trump administration has “dismantled longstanding norms,” the authors wrote, invoking “archaic statutes,” enlisting “support from state and local law enforcement as well as federal agencies that historically had no immigration enforcement role,” and pressuring “foreign governments to receive deportees,” the MPI report stated. “Perhaps most visibly, it militarized immigration enforcement.”

Trump has achieved his policy mostly through executive actions, rather than with legislative help, something he has boasted about repeatedly.

“Remember Biden, he said I have to get approval from Congress,” Trump said in a speech in Detroit on Jan. 13. “Had nothing to do with Congress, had to do with respect.”

In one of his first actions upon taking office in January 2025, Trump issued a proclamation that “the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.” He mostly blocked migrants’ ability to request asylum. He canceled humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration extended to Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy, so that asylum seekers were sent to Mexico to await their court appearances in the U.S.

In December, Trump paused all asylum decisions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And on Jan. 14, the president indefinitely paused the processing of immigrant visas for 75 nations, including Afghanistan, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, Thailand, Somalia and Yemen. He had previously issued a full or partial ban on travel from 39 countries.

MPI estimated that in the first year of his second term, Trump has taken more than 500 actions on immigration including 38 executive orders and “hundreds of other actions via presidential proclamations and policy guidance.” That’s more actions than in all four years of Trump’s first term, MPI said.

But Congress has provided some help. In July, Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included more than $170 billion to ramp up immigration enforcement, detention and deportation.

Increasingly, the administration has turned its attention to interior enforcement. According to MPI, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled.”

In December, the Department of Homeland Security reported that its enforcement operations have resulted in more than 622,000 deportations since January 2025 (short of the stated goal of at least 1 million per year). And, DHS said, another “1.9 million illegal aliens have voluntarily self-deported,” some of whom were lured by government incentives — a free flight home and $1,000. MPI said the Trump administration hasn’t provided any data to back up that self-deportation claim.

A New York Times analysis of federal data disputed the administration’s figures, with its Jan. 17 analysis, covering Trump’s first year, estimating the number of deportations at 540,000, including 230,000 people who were detained inside the country, 270,000 deported at the border and 40,000 who signed up for the government incentives to self-deport. The Times speculated that the administration’s 622,000 figure “likely includes all repatriations carried out by various homeland security subagencies,” such as ship crews that are barred from disembarking.

Both the Times and MPI noted that DHS hasn’t released detailed, public reports on these statistics, as it has in the past.

In any case, the Times noted the number of deportations lagged the number in Biden’s last two years in office: 590,000 total deportations in 2023 and 650,000 in 2024, when border apprehensions were much higher than they are now. The number of people Trump has deported from inside the country, 230,000, is far higher than the 50,000 deported from inside the country in 2024.

Refugees

In his first term, Trump sharply reduced refugee admissions. But now they have nearly stopped entirely.

As we wrote last year, Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office that called for a “realignment” of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including an indefinite suspension of all admissions until the program “aligns with the interests of the United States.”

There have been few exceptions to the new refugee policy – notably for refugees from South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner ethnic group. In making an exception for Afrikaners, Trump claimed there was “a genocide that’s taking place” against white farmers in the country – which, as we wrote, distorts the facts.

Beginning in February, the U.S. has admitted only 1,226 refugees in Trump’s first full 11 months in office – including 1,059 refugees from South Africa, according to State Department data.

By contrast, the U.S. admitted 70,033 during the same 11-month period, from February 2024 through December 2024, under Biden. That’s a staggering 98% decline.

For fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1, 2025, Trump placed a cap of 7,500 on refugee admissions – which is far fewer than the 125,000 cap Biden instituted for fiscal year 2025. It’s also much less than the 45,000 cap that Trump placed on refugees in fiscal year 2018, which was his first full fiscal year as president during his first term.

Other than refugees from South Africa, Trump was forced by a court ruling to admit some refugees who had plans to resettle in the U.S. when he suspended the program.

As we wrote, an appeals court ruled (in a clarifying opinion issued April 21) that refugees who had an “approved refugee application” and “had arranged and confirmable travel plans” on or before Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order can enter the country. About 160 refugees were affected by that decision, a spokesman for the International Refugee Assistance Project told us for an article in September.

Most of the non-South Africans admitted last year came from Afghanistan. The U.S. admitted 100 Afghan refugees in the past 11 months, the State Department data show.

In addition to suspending the refugee program, Trump more recently has threatened to deport refugees who settled in Minnesota, citing an ongoing fraud investigation in that city.

In a Jan. 9 statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “reexamining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims,” beginning with “Minnesota’s 5,600 refugees who have not yet been given lawful permanent resident status (Green Cards).”

Trade

The international trade deficit, which Trump criticized for reaching record levels under Biden, decreased only slightly in the months since Trump took office for his second term.

Through his first full nine months in office, the U.S. imported $654 billion more in goods and services than it exported, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s about 0.9% less than the $659.7 billion gap between U.S. imports and exports during the same period in 2024.

The full impact of Trump’s new tariff policies on the trade imbalance is still to be determined. The New York Times noted that “because of a surge in imports earlier this year,” to avoid import tariffs that later went into effect, “the overall trade deficit from January to October was still up 7.7 percent from the previous year.”

Also, when the goods and services trade deficit for the month of October went down 60% year-over-year to $29.4 billion, the lowest monthly total since June 2009, the Times said that some economists attributed the decrease to “temporary fluctuations in trade in certain products, like gold and pharmaceuticals.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the newspaper: “Cutting through the noise and getting to the underlying signal in the data, it suggests to me that the deficit is as large as its ever been.”

Corporate Profits

Corporate profits set records each year under Biden, but dipped in the first quarter under Trump before rebounding slightly in the second quarter and recovering fully in the third quarter.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that after-tax corporate profits at an annual rate were $3.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025 – about $91 billion, or 2.6%, higher than the full-year figure for 2024.

The fourth quarter and annual figures for last year won’t be released until March, so it is still unclear if after-tax corporate profits for the full year will be up or down.

Under Biden, the annual average growth was 31% in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, 7.8% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024, according to BEA data.

Stock Market

The stock market, which set records during Biden’s presidency, reached new heights again under Trump.

The S&P 500, which is made up of 500 large-cap companies, closed at 15.7% higher on Jan. 16 than it was three days before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 13.5% over that same period.

And the Nasdaq composite index, comprising more than 3,000 companies, many in the technology sector, surged by almost 19.8% in that time frame.

These gains followed ample market increases during the Biden administration, when the S&P rose 57.8%, the Dow Jones went up 40.6%, and the Nasdaq increased by almost half.

Food Stamps

After a slight increase in enrollment during Biden’s presidency, the latest data from the Department of Agriculture show that under Trump fewer people are accessing benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

About 41.6 million people were receiving federal food assistance in September, according to preliminary USDA figures published last month. The number has gone down by about 1.2 million participants, or 2.8%, since Trump took office.

The number of individuals benefiting from SNAP is expected to decline further because of the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which changed eligibility requirements for SNAP and is estimated to reduce federal spending on the program. For example, the law extends work requirements to include “able-bodied adults without dependents” aged 55 to 64, who were previously exempt.

In August, the Congressional Budget Office said that provisions in the law “will reduce participation in SNAP by roughly 2.4 million people in an average month over the 2025-2034 period.”

Crime

We won’t have annual 2025 crime data from the FBI until the fall. But other reports on part of the year show violent crime has continued to drop, a trend that began in 2022 after a spike in crime, particularly murders, in 2020.

AH Datalytics, an independent criminal justice data analysis group, produces a Real-Time Crime Index, an aggregation of crime data collected from 570 law enforcement agencies. That index shows a 19.8% decline in the number of murders for January to October 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. Longer term, the index shows the number of murders jumped in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, then leveled off and has been dropping since 2022.

The latest report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which compares Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2025, to the same period in the prior year, similarly found a 19.1% decline in the number of murders for 67 law enforcement agencies. The number of rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults also went down, with the latter decreasing by 10%.

A midyear 2025 report by the Council on Criminal Justice on 42 cities, which consistently published data since 2019, found the same trend, with crime levels now mostly below pre-pandemic levels. “Examining trends over a longer timeframe, violent crimes are below levels seen in the first half of 2019, the year prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020,” the CCJ report said. It noted, though, that the drop in murders has been concentrated in a few cities.

“Much of the decline in the national homicide rate, which began in late 2022, has been driven by large drops in a few sample cities with high homicide levels, such as Baltimore and St. Louis,” CCJ said in a press release about its findings. “The most recent data show that all of the sample cities are now below the general peak of 2020 to 2021, but more than 60% continue to experience homicide levels above pre-2020 rates.”

Gun Sales

After reaching a record high in 2020, estimated gun sales declined every year that Biden was president. That downward trend continued during Trump’s first year back in office.

The government doesn’t collect data on gun sales. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — estimates gun sales by tracking the number of background checks for firearm sales based on the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NSSF-adjusted figures exclude background checks unrelated to sales, such as those required for concealed-carry permits.

According to NSSF, the number of background checks for gun purchases in 2025 was roughly 14.6 million – down 4.1% from about 15.2 million in 2024. But the 2025 total was still higher than the almost 13.2 million estimated sales in 2019, before the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to publish its annual manufacturing figures, so we don’t know whether firearm production, specifically of handguns, increased or decreased in 2025.

Debt and Deficits

Trump’s campaign pledge that “we’re going to actually start paying off debt” hasn’t happened yet. The publicly held debt increased by about one-third on Biden’s watch and continued to rise during the first year of Trump’s second term.

As of Jan. 14, the debt held by the public, which excludes money the federal government owes to itself, was almost $30.8 trillion – up about 6.7% from more than $28.8 trillion on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before he took office.

Another annual deficit – close to $1.8 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 – was a key factor. It was the fourth highest fiscal deficit of all time (behind FY 2020, FY 2021 and FY 2024) and the sixth consecutive budget gap of more than $1 trillion.

Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency had promised to cut federal spending by at least $1 trillion, a goal it did not achieve. Instead, federal spending went up a bit in fiscal 2025.

And, so far, the U.S. appears headed for another debt-increasing deficit in FY 2026 – although perhaps a smaller one. From October through December, the first quarter of the current fiscal cycle, the CBO said that federal outlays exceeded revenues by $601 billion. That’s about $110 billion less than the deficit in the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Oil Production and Imports

Trump campaigned on a promise that the U.S. would “drill, baby, drill” during a second Trump term, and on his first day back in office, he signed an executive order with a stated goal of “unleashing American energy.”

As of October, U.S. crude oil production had increased to an average of 13.6 million barrels per day in Trump’s first full nine months in the White House, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s up almost 2.5% from the same nine-month period in 2024.

Before Trump was inaugurated, and before any of his policies were in place, the EIA had already projected in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook that average daily production would increase to a record 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.

U.S. crude oil imports are trending in the opposite direction.

Imports were down to an average of about 6.1 million barrels per day during Trump’s first full nine months — a decrease of 6.9% from nearly 6.6 million barrels per day during the comparable period a year earlier. During the Biden years, average imports increased annually.

Carbon Emissions

EIA data also show a small increase in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption under Trump

There were approaching 3.2 billion metric tons of emissions from the consumption of coal, natural gas and various petroleum products in his first full eight months in office. That was roughly 1.4% more than the over 3.1 billion metric tons that were emitted from consuming those energy sources during the same stretch in 2024.

In early January 2025, the EIA projected that CO2 emissions would increase slightly in 2025, but remain in the ballpark of 4.8 billion metric tons emitted in 2024. The agency said it expected emissions growth due to the increased consumption of petroleum products across multiple sectors, particularly the use of diesel fuel and jet fuel.

Emissions had declined in 2023 and 2024 after increasing in Biden’s first two years as president.

Health Insurance

We don’t yet have data on how health insurance coverage has changed so far under Trump’s second term. Typically, the National Health Interview Survey has released quarterly preliminary reports on the insurance status of Americans. But the NHIS’ website now says that as of 2025, the data will only be released biannually.

The latest report, posted in June 2025, covers calendar year 2024. The NHIS is a project of the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A report on estimates from the survey for January to June 2025 is scheduled to be released on Jan. 30.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, is expected to prompt a rise in the number of people who lack health insurance, starting next year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the uninsured would increase by 10 million people over 10 years, with most of the increase due to the law’s changes to Medicaid. For 2026, the rise was estimated at 1.3 million people. (See the link to estimated changes in people without health insurance.)

In 2024, the last year of Biden’s term, 8.2% of the population, or 27.2 million people, were uninsured, according to the NHIS’ estimates, which measure those uninsured at the time they were interviewed. A Census Bureau report, released in September and measuring those who were uninsured for the entire calendar year, similarly put the uninsured rate at 8%.

Under Biden’s full term, the percentage and number of Americans who are uninsured declined, as we explained in our “Biden’s Final Numbers” report.

Judiciary Appointments

In his first term, Trump filled one-third of the Supreme Court, nearly 30% of the appeals court seats and nearly 26% of District Court seats. So far in his second term, the judiciary confirmation numbers lag a bit behind those in Biden’s first year.

Supreme Court — There hasn’t been a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the first year of Trump’s second term, just as there wasn’t a vacancy in Biden’s first year.

Court of Appeals — As of Jan. 16, Trump has won confirmation for six U.S. Court of Appeals judges. At the same point in his term, Biden had won confirmation for 12.

District Court — Twenty-one Trump nominees to be District Court judges have been confirmed, while 29 were confirmed at the same point in Biden’s first year.

Two U.S. Court of Federal Claims judges also were confirmed in Biden’s first year. None have been confirmed so far under Trump, and there are no vacancies for such positions.

As of Jan. 16, there were no vacancies for Court of Appeals judges, 39 for District Court judges with five nominees pending, and one vacancy for the international trade court.

LeTennier, the Appellate Division, Third Department issued a significant published decision that not only affirms the challenged orders, leaving the foreclosure judgment in favor of the lender in place, but also constitutes the first appellate‑level case in New York to address sanctions arising from the misuse of generative AI in legal submissions.

Hinshaw partners Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey represented the lender in this appeal.

Background

The underlying foreclosure action had already been the subject of extensive motion practice, including numerous post‑judgment attempts by the borrower to vacate or relitigate issues that had long been resolved.

The borrower continued to challenge the lender’s standing despite the Appellate Division’s prior ruling in 2020 affirming summary judgment in the lender’s favor.

When the borrower later appealed several subsequent orders—including the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment—the Appellate Division held that these challenges were either meritless or abandoned.

The Court Identifies Extensive Use of Fabricated, AI‑Generated Case Law

What distinguishes this decision is the court’s detailed examination of the borrower’s and his counsel’s reliance on fabricated legal authorities. Across multiple appellate filings, counsel submitted more than 20 non‑existent case citations generated by AI, as well as misstatements of law drawn from real cases. The court found that this conduct was frivolous under 22 NYCRR 130‑1.1.

Although the decision acknowledges that generative AI tools can have legitimate uses in legal practice, it warns that attorneys remain responsible for verifying the accuracy of any material included in court submissions. The court emphasized that reliance on generative AI does not relieve counsel of their professional and ethical duties, particularly the obligation to ensure that all authorities cited actually exist and accurately reflect the law.

Sanctions Imposed

Given the seriousness and persistence of the misconduct, the court imposed:

$7,500 sanction on the borrower’s counsel, and

$2,500 sanction on the borrower himself.

Notably, the court observed that counsel increased his use of fake, AI-generated legal authorities even after being placed on notice about the problem, which the court found particularly concerning.

Why This Decision Matters

This opinion places New York squarely within the growing national dialogue on the responsible use of generative AI in litigation. As the first appellate‑level decision in the state to address sanctions for misuse of AI‑generated content, it provides important guidance to litigants and practitioners.

The ruling aligns with the emerging expectation across jurisdictions that generative AI may be used by litigants, but only with appropriate human oversight, verification, and accountability.

For lenders, servicers, and financial institutions, the decision also reaffirms the stability of prior standing determinations, prevents continued re-litigation of settled issues, and reinforces courts’ willingness to sanction frivolous foreclosure‑related tactics.

Conclusion

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. LeTennier establishes a meaningful precedent in New York’s appellate jurisprudence, both in the foreclosure context and in the rapidly evolving area of AI‑related legal ethics. Hinshaw attorneys Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey were pleased to secure this result on behalf of their lender client.

They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens.
However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.
There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad.
And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it.","Exactly a year ago today, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. He took over a nation with strong imperialistic tendencies and a democratic polity but with widespread illiberal features throughout its history and, in less than a year, succeeded in establishing a 21st-century US variant of fascism while espousing a lawless world order.

The successful transition of the United States from an imperial republic to what could be best described as imperial proto-fascism was achieved due to the ease with which the Trump administration weakened the country’s institutions meant to restrain power and the massive support that it received, and continues to receive, from the nation’s oligarchy. There are thus eerie similarities between Trump’s United States and the rise of Italian fascism and German Nazism, and none more so than those between Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and Mussolini’s Squadristi and Hitler’s Sturmabteilung (SA), respectively.

Fascism, the most reactionary regime of oligopolistic and decaying capitalism, has always relied on violent paramilitary groups to intimidate political opponents and spread fear across society. In Italy, in 1919, Benito Mussolini formed a paramilitary squad of war veterans called Blackshirts (or squadristi) whose primary goal was to terrorize fascism’s political opponents, mainly the socialists and the communists. By the early 1920s, the squadristi had wiped out the Italian left and destroyed Italian democracy. In Germany, in 1921, Adolf Hitler established the SA, known as the Brownshirts due to their brown uniforms. They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens. Blackshirts and Brownshirts acted with impunity as the regular uniformed police in both Italy and Germany turned a blind eye to their thuggish tactics.

Violent paramilitary groups were seen by fascists as essential tools in the struggle to uproot the previous sociopolitical and cultural order and pave the way for the success of fascism’s ultimate goals and objectives, which are to promote extreme nationalism and do away with democratic liberties and implement policies without legal or political restraints while dehumanizing those labeled as “the enemy.” Under fascism, propaganda and violence work in unity in order to secure conformity and subdue the opposition.

Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside.

Enter the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). ICE was created in 2003 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The US Congress has granted ICE “a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities,” which make it a very powerful federal law enforcement agency. The primary mission of ICE is to enforce immigration laws. It has the power to search, arrest, and deport undocumented immigrants. It can also detain and try to deport green card holders by claiming that they represent a threat to US national security.

On December 19, DHS announced that it had deported more than 620,000 noncitizens while 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have “self-deported” since Trump took office. If these figures are true and haven’t been exaggerated for propaganda purposes, we’re looking at the largest forced relocation of immigrants in a single year in the history of the United States. Immigration detention has also expanded dramatically in Trump's second term.

ICE immigration raids have been accused of excessive-use-of-force tactics and violating US citizens’ constitutional rights. Unshockingly enough given that the Trump administration relies on terror to push its inhuman agenda, DHS has used a variety of loathsome names for ICE immigration raids, ranging from “Operation Midway Blitz” (“Blitz” is a German word for lightning and was used to describe the bombing campaign undertaken by Nazi Germany on British cities, ports, and industrial sites in 1940) to “Operation Dirtbag.”

ICE has always been a notorious agency, even from the time it was designed to fight terrorism, and “the subject of numerous allegation of abuses and violations,” as has been pointed out by Brazilian professor and expert in international migration Gustavo Dias. ICE became especially aggressive during the Obama administration, when US liberals like to forget that it was responsible for over 3 million deportations. However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.

There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad. Trump’s domestic policy agenda revolves around the reshaping of US political culture, from liberal to illiberal through rollbacks in civil and human rights, putting an end to rising population diversity and creating (or fantasizing) in turn a white paradise, and advancing the interests of corporate oligarchs and digital feudal lords. Hence the attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); hence the violent immigration crackdown and banning citizens of “shithole countries” from vising the US; hence the erasing of non-white history; and hence the war against organized labor.

The successful implementation of all of the above policies demand loyalty to Trump’s actions from servants in the administrative state, conformity from major institutional actors, and a subdued civil society. No regime, however oppressive, can implement its policies without having a large network of allies, influential entities willing to conform, and citizen control and popular acquiescence. Trump has succeeded in securing loyalty by offering key federal positions to allies and supporters and replacing public servants with political loyalists. He has forced elite institutions to bend to his will with threats and intimidation tactics while tech billionaires and other members of the oligarchy kissed his ring because they feared retribution.

However, keeping the public subdued is trickier for any regime than cowing elite institutions and members of the economic elite into subservience. This is where ICE comes into play. ICE tactics are designed to instill fear in people and create chaos in communities as part of an overarching strategy aimed to silence opposition to Trump’s overall domestic agenda and let citizens know that this is the dawn of a new era for the United States. Dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0, and undesirable elements, the “radical left,” and all those deemed unpatriotic will be weeded out.

US citizens are an intended target as much as the immigrant communities across the nation by Trump’s lawlessness. ICE agents wearing masks and decked out in military-style gear reflects the militarization of law enforcement, which is a trademark of fascist regimes and brutal dictatorships. And the message intended by the unleashing of a paramilitary force, Trump’s own goon squad, throughout the nation’s communities is to let people know that you are either with us or against us. This was indeed the intended message behind the murder of Renee Nicole Good. ICE agents stopping US citizens, at random, and going from door to door demanding proof of citizenship, as has been happening in Minneapolis-St. Paul and other places, are scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany and speak volumes to the sociopolitical order envisioned by the Trump administration.

ICE is already acting in a similar way to how the Blackshirts (Italy) and the Brownshirts (Germany) functioned under Mussolini and Hitler, respectively. Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside. And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it. The only question now is whether citizens throughout the land will resist to the end, until fascism is fully defeated, or surrender to fear and intimidation and, in turn, find themselves being deprived not only of their basic rights but also stripped of their dignity, which is what fascism ultimately does to human beings.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62704197&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C414%2C0%2C415,N,,2026-01-20 16:57:58.574257

(WPRI) — In his first executive order of the year, Mayor Brett Smiley has unveiled an executive order aimed at making it more difficult for federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement operations in Providence.

The move comes on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and just months after Smiley signed an executive order reaffirming that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

The executive order titled, “Prohibiting the Use of City Property for Civil Immigration Enforcement Activities,” states that city-owned parking lots, garages, parks, or buildings can’t be used as a “staging area, processing location, operations base, or other support for civil immigration enforcement,” unless authorities are executing “lawful judicial warrants.”

“The federal actions we are seeing across the nation are threatening immigrant communities and causing fear and uncertainty for all of our neighbors,” Smiley said Monday. “Providence’s strength comes from our diverse immigrant communities, and we will continue to do everything we can to protect families and maintain trust across our neighborhoods.”

The order also stated that city property can’t be used to assemble, mobilize or deploy vehicles, equipment, materials or personnel for the purpose of carrying out civil immigration enforcement operations.

The city will also install signage on properties that would fall under the executive order, stating that they may not be used for civil immigration enforcement.

The directive also says the city will also provide “standardized signage templates” to private landowners and leaseholders, “if they choose, for display to identify the nonpublic areas of the property in which the landowner or lease holder wishes to restrict activities related to civil immigration enforcement.”

Private landowners and leaseholders can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith,” according to the executive order.

In his last executive order, Smiley reaffirmed that the city is meant to be a “safe and welcoming place for all,” and that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

Less than a week ago, President Trump announced his administration will strip federal funding from sanctuary cities and states.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions, including Rhode Island, that were deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws.

U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.
""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""
In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota.
The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.","The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Minnesota to allow the Trump administration's immigration operations to continue as tensions simmer over the tactics used by federal officers throughout the state.

The Jan. 19 filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last week by Minnesota and the Twin Cities, which sought to stop the deployment of immigration agents, saying the intervention violated the state's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.

""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""

The back and forth comes after nearly two weeks of protests in the state following the killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. The fatal shooting sparked demonstrations nationwide and has deepened fissures between federal and state officials.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021, is also presiding over a case brought in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists who said federal agents violated their constitutional rights and used excessive force against demonstrators.

In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. In her order, Menendez said the record indicates that agents engaged in ""chilling conduct,"" including the ""drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.""

The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

In Minneapolis, skirmishes have increasingly broken out between protesters and federal officers across the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators interrupted a church service, claiming that one of the church's pastors is an ICE agent.

The Justice Department, which has said there is no basis to investigate the officer who fatally shot Good, launched a probe into the protest, citing potential civil rights violations. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to Minnesota, on Jan. 20 called for the arrests and potential deportation of those involved in the demonstration.

The facility would be operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of what the Trump administration describes as a ramped-up enforcement effort targeting people living in the country illegally.

According to reporting from The Oklahoman, the plan involves converting an empty warehouse near Interstate 40 and Council Road into a detention and processing center, and federal officials did not notify city or state leaders beforehand because federal law does not require it.

State Sen. Carri Hicks, whose district includes parts of Oklahoma City, said the lack of notice immediately raised concerns.

“It really caused me a lot of concern,” Hicks said.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

“I’m an elected official and lots of people have questions and are justly concerned that this could be already developed and in plans for implementation,” Hicks said.

Discussion of a possible detention center at the warehouse began last month after The Washington Post reported ICE planned to purchase warehouses nationwide to detain as many as 80,000 people.

On Sunday, The Oklahoman reported the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to city officials outlining plans for a small-scale processing center that could hold up to 1,500 detainees arrested by ICE.

Within a day of that report, anti-ICE signs appeared outside the building.

“Folks weren’t notified. Community didn’t even have awareness that this was undergoing plans,” Hicks said. “It’s not a rumor. We’ve seen the developed plans and we know that this is coming to that particular location.”

Hicks said her concerns center on what she describes as a lack of accountability and due process in ICE’s recent enforcement actions.

“At the heart of it, we have a federal immigration policy—and what we’re currently seeing is not an extension of what we know to be the processes in which folks can come here legally and receive their immigration status and become citizens of the United States of America,” Hicks said.

News 4 previously reported on an ICE raid in Oklahoma City last April in which agents searched a home public records showed their suspect had already sold and moved out of, leaving the new family living there traumatized.

“There are some terrible and very troubling stories that continue to occur,” Hicks said, “Particularly in the south side.”

The proposed detention center would sit in a commercial district along a busy roadway and was not originally designed to house detainees.

“It’s less than two miles from Western Heights School District, where about 50% of the students are Hispanic,” Hicks said. “So as I’m thinking about those students and I’m thinking about the parents and I’m thinking about the impact to that local community, it is appalling.”

Hicks said she wants federal officials to abandon the plan altogether.

“We don’t want your detention facility,” Hicks said. “If there are specific individuals that have warrants who absolutely need to be apprehended to protect public safety, then continue to do things through our normal way of operations, continue to make sure that these are targeted operations and not community-wide sweeps that throw everything into turmoil, because when the federal government leaves, our city will be left holding the price tag of diverting public services or public safety resources, and the fallout will be immense, and we, as the local residents, will be left with that fallout.”

Because of the federal holiday, News 4 has been unable to reach anyone with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.

The Oklahoman also reported the phone number listed for the DHS official overseeing the project has been disconnected since Friday.",https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/A-sign-along-South-Council-Road-outside-a-planned-ICE-dtention-facility-in-Oklahoma-City-.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:37.574371

There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,"" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies.
So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions.
“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.","As outrage grew over the Trump administration’s immigration raids and the shooting death of a Minnesota woman at the hands of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., had had enough.

After consulting with key Democratic colleagues, she began pushing for impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in early January.

The decision drew mixed reactions. Two sources familiar with the response among Democratic lawmakers told MS NOW that, in a private meeting of top Democrats in early January, Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., blasted the move, saying it poses a problem for “frontliners” — members in swing seats — who must appeal to more than just Democratic voters.

As battleground leadership, Lee is responsible for voicing the perspective of the party’s most politically vulnerable members.

“It got really intense,” one of the sources said, speaking anonymously with MS NOW to discuss the sensitive moment. “People are trying to figure out how to handle it right now.”

The private moment is emblematic of a larger public problem vexing Democrats: Their base wants action amid a deluge of controversial actions from President Donald Trump and his administration, and Democratic leaders in Washington — charged with winning elections and appealing to as many Americans as possible — are trying not to alienate potential swing voters by being anti-Trump or pro-impeachment.

Not that Democrats could impeach anyone on their own right now, anyway.

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies. Even now, multiple Democratic members — including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who quipped that he was “no mathematician” but knew the numbers — told MS NOW the votes aren’t there to move on impeachment against any Trump officials.

But Jeffries also told reporters last week that Democrats “haven’t ruled anything in and … haven’t ruled anything out.”

“Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” he said.

As Democratic leaders consider their stance, they’ve asked members to coordinate with ranking members of key committees on any potential pushes against administration officials, both to avoid surprising colleagues and to work to build consensus.

So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions. There’s one against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on top of the new effort against Noem. Two members also tried to launch proceedings against Trump, who was impeached by the House twice in his first term — once for an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine and then for his actions to foment an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Republicans in the Senate acquitted him on both charges. And the latest resolutions died on the legislative vine last year.

Still, the threat against the president looms — including in Trump’s mind ahead of the midterms.

In remarks to House Republicans during their policy retreat earlier this month, Trump implored them to stay focused on winning the November midterm elections, because if they lose control of Congress, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the question of accountability — how to do it and what it means — is central in this Trump era, forced into greater focus given that Democrats are in the minority with few levers of power to pull.

Do they shut down the government to oppose the “most lawless Department of Homeland Security,” as Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has left open as a possibility? Do they offer articles of impeachment against Cabinet members? Would war powers resolutions, meant to restrain what the administration can do militarily, halt a march toward wars in Venezuela, Cuba and Greenland — even if Democrats could get Republicans on board to pass them?

At each new inflection point, there’s a dissonant response among Democrats.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MS NOW in December that Trump “crossed the line” for impeachment in his first term, but suggested the actions of his second term so far don’t warrant the same reaction.

“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said. “He gave us no choice, he crossed the line here and there.”

“The fact is,” she continued, “what we’re here to do is meet the needs of the American people. If he goes to a place, that’s a different story, but it isn’t something you go looking for.”

Recommended

Asked for his view on the same question a few weeks later, Murphy declined to advocate for the House starting an impeachment inquiry on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But he said he has “common sense.”

“I know this president has committed 10 times more impeachable offenses in his second term as he did in his first term,” Murphy said.

On Capitol Hill, after Kelly’s impeachment resolution was announced, he dismissed questions from MS NOW about whether he supported the tactic.

Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.

“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever-mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light,” Rep. April Delaney, D-Md., said in a statement after the U.S.’ military operation in Venezuela.

“I now believe that our Democratic caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” she added.

Beyond discussing whether impeachment would be an effort worth their time, some lawmakers also worry such a push — even a merited one — could backfire politically.

One House Democrat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said an impeachment push could be a “political distraction” from the top issues during this election cycle, including affordability and the cost of living.

“There are just some exuberant Democrats that are anxious to pull the trigger on impeachment, and there are many more of us who agree that a lot of impeachable stuff is happening on a weekly basis around here,” this Democratic lawmaker told MS NOW. “But it is futile to pretend that you’re actually going to do an impeachment in this Congress, and it could actually be counterproductive because it raises expectations among Democratic base voters that this is something we can actually deliver.”

“Two things can be true at the same time,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told MS NOW last week.

She said Trump had “absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt” committed impeachable offenses. And she said “accountability needs to be a core part of our governance.”

But she also noted that she personally doesn’t run campaigns as “purely anti-Trump.”

“I’ve personally never run to represent my district on grounds of impeachment or not,” she said.

“I run for health care. My community wants to hear about raising the minimum wage, expanding unions, health, strengthening health care, and I think it’s important that we have an affirmative, positive vision for the country. But that doesn’t mean that we shy away from what needs to be done in terms of having accountability.”",https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260119_Trump-Year-One-Impeachment-bk.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:24.307937

Three cardinals in the US Catholic church have criticized the Trump administration’s foreign policy, saying its push to obtain or otherwise seize Greenland, recent military action in Venezuela, and cuts to humanitarian aid risk “destroying international relations and plunging the world into incalculable suffering”.

“Our country’s moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,” said a joint statement from Blase Cupich, Robert McElroy and Joseph Tobin, respectively the archbishops of Chicago, Washington DC, and Newark, New Jersey.

“And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity’s wellbeing now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies,” it added.

Without naming Donald Trump, the statement on Monday continued: “We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.”

Supreme court does not issue decision on legality of Trump's global tariffs

The supreme court did not issue a decision today on the legality of Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs.

It’s not immediately clear the next date the court will issue opinions.

Share

Two boxes have been brought out at the supreme court, which means there could be up to four decisions released today.

Share

As we wait on today’s opinions from the supreme court, it’s worth remembering that justices on the bench appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments justifying the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to slap duties on dozens of countries, citing a national emergency. A reminder that the ability to institute taxes is a power normally only afforded to Congress.

Per my last post, my colleagues Jakub Krupa and Yohannes Lowe are reporting the latest developments out of Europe at our dedicate live blog. While Graeme Wearden is providing updates from Davos on our business blog.

Graeme notes that at an earlier press conference today, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that there are four “fantastic candidates” for Federal Reserve chair. He expects the Trump administration to make an announcement “maybe as early as next week”.

In a spree of Truth Social posts overnight, Donald Trump posted an altered image of himself, planting a US flag in Greenland, alongside JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

In another post, also featuring a doctored photo, it shows Trump behind the resolute desk speaking to European leaders while he shows off a map that shows an American flag covering the US, Canada and Greenland.

Trump’s campaign to acquire the autonomous territory, that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, has reached fever pitch in recent days after he threatened tariffs against allied countries who have spoken out against his moves on Greenland. We can expect more friction as the president heads to Davos today.

Earlier, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen repeatedly criticized Trump for his levy threats, saying they would be “a mistake” and could send the relations into “a downward spiral” that benefits geopolitical rivals. She also pledged her solidarity and support with Denmark and Greenland.

Second man dies at Texas ICE detention facility in two weeks

Victoria Bekiempis

A second man being held at a US immigration detention facility in Texas has died in two weeks, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Monday.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole.

On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him. The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso …

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him. His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide.

Judge refuses to block new DHS policy limiting Congress members’ access to ICE facilities

Yohannes Lowe

In other news, a federal judge has refused to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit – and thereby inspect – immigration detention facilities.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities (you can read her judgment here).

Judge Cobb, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, had blocked a virtually identical policy by the DHS last month, citing a clause in the appropriations law that funds the department and requires facilities to be open to congressional scrutiny.

However, ICE reestablished the visitation policy on 8 January 2026, with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, ordering the DHS to re-impose the seven-day notice requirement – but “exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),” not regular appropriations, effectively bypassing the previous court order.

The background to this is that last June, a dozen House Democrats who were blocked from visiting immigration detention facilities sued the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully obstructing their efforts to visit federal immigration detention centers.

Members of Congress had tried to visit the facilities amid reports of inhumane and unsanitary conditions. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody so far this year.

In her ruling on Monday, Judge Cobb said the plaintiffs’ attorneys representing Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge the new policy and said the lawmakers would need to revise their complaint. She did not rule on the legality of the policy.

US supreme court to hear challenge to Hawaii’s strict gun law

Eric Berger

Hawaii, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, will see its regulations challenged before the supreme court on Tuesday.

The court will consider the legality of the state’s law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public unless they have permission from the property owner.

The case, Wolford v Lopez, was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group.

US supreme court ruling on Trump's tariffs could come as early as Tuesday

Yohannes Lowe

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. The much-anticipated US supreme court ruling on the legality of Donald Trump’s tariffs is expected in the coming weeks, and possibly as early as Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency.

Those challenging the tariffs, which include some small businesses and US states, argue the president exceeded his authority when imposing the sweeping levies last year.

Two lower courts have already found that the president did not have the authority to impose global tariffs, which were brought in using emergency powers allowing the president to issue immediate orders and bypass Congress.

The supreme court, which is dominated by conservative justices, could throw out the tariffs – the cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda – and force the president to send refunds to the US importers that paid them.

But if the supreme court does rule Trump overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs, the White House has other ways it can bring in import taxes.

In a 15 January interview with the NY Times published on Monday, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said the administration would “start the next day” to replace the tariffs with other levies if the ruling went against Trump.

“The reality is the president is going to have tariffs as part of his trade policy going forward,” Greer said. Last week, Trump said it would be “a complete mess” if the court were to strike down his trade tariffs, which he said would be difficult to reverse because businesses and countries could claim refunds.

Hiring bonuses of $50,000. Swelling ranks of ICE officers, to 22,000, in an expanding national force bigger than most police departments in America.

President Donald Trump promised the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, but achieving his goal wouldn't have been possible without funding from the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Republicans in Congress, and it's fueling unprecedented immigration enforcement actions in cities like Minneapolis and beyond.

The GOP's big bill is ""supercharging ICE,"" one budget expert said, in ways that Americans may not fully realize — and that have only just begun.

""I just don't think people have a sense of the scale,"" said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress and a former adviser to the Biden administration's Office of Management and Budget.

""We're looking at ICE in a way we've never seen before,"" he said.

Trump's big bill creates massive law enforcement force

As the Republican president marks the first year of his second term, the immigration enforcement and removal operation that has been a cornerstone of his domestic and foreign policy agenda is rapidly transforming into something else — a national law enforcement presence with billions upon billions of dollars in new spending from U.S. taxpayers.

The shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis showed the alarming reach of the new federalized force, sparking unrelenting protests against the military-styled officers seen going door to door to find and detain immigrants. Amid the outpouring of opposition, Trump revived threats to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the demonstrations and the U.S. Army has 1,500 soldiers ready to deploy.

But Trump's own public approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has slipped since he took office, according to an AP-NORC poll.

""Public sentiment is everything,"" said Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N.Y., at a press conference at the Capitol with lawmakers supporting legislation to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Americans, she said, are upset at what they are seeing. ""They didn't sign on for this,"" she said.

Border crossings down, but Americans confront new ICE enforcements

To be sure, illegal crossings into the U.S. at the Mexico border have fallen to historic lows under Trump, a remarkable shift from just a few years ago when President Joe Biden's Democratic administration allowed millions of people to temporarily enter the U.S. as they adjudicated their claims to stay.

Yet as enforcement moves away from the border, the newly hired army of immigration officers swarming city streets with aggressive tactics — in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere — is something not normally seen in the U.S.

Armed and masked law enforcement officers are being witnessed smashing car windows, yanking people from vehicles and chasing and wrestling others to the ground and hauling them away — images playing out in endless loops on TVs and other screens.

And it's not just ICE. A long list of supporting agencies, including federal, state and local police and sheriff's offices, are entering into contract partnerships with Homeland Security to conduct immigration enforcement operations in communities around the nation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has warned Democrats that this is ""no time to be playing games"" by stirring up the opposition to immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis and other places.

""They need to get out of the way and allow federal law enforcement to do its duty,"" Johnson said at the Capitol.

Noem has said the immigration enforcement officers are acting lawfully. The department insists it's targeting criminals in the actions, what officials call the worst of the worst immigrants.

However, reports show that non-criminals and U.S. citizens are also being forcibly detained by immigration officers. The Supreme Court last year lifted a ban on using race alone in the immigration stops.

Trump last month called Somali immigrants ""garbage,"" comments that echoed his past objections to immigrants from certain countries.

The Trump administration has set a goal of 100,000 detentions a day, about three times what's typical, with 1 million deportations a year.

Money from the big bill flows with few restraints

With Republican control of Congress, the impeachment of Noem or any other Trump official is not a viable political option for Democrats, who would not appear to have the vote tally even among their own ranks.

In fact, even if Congress wanted to curtail Trump's immigration operations — by threatening to shut down the government, for example — it would be difficult to stop the spend.

What Trump called the ""big, beautiful bill"" is essentially on autopilot through 2029, the year he's scheduled to finish his term and leave office.

The legislation essentially doubled annual Homeland Security funding, adding $170 billion to be used over four years. Of that, ICE, which typically receives about $10 billion a year, was provided $30 billion for operations and $45 billion for detention facilities.

""The first thing that comes to mind is spending on this level is typically done on the military,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement.""

Ahead, Congress will need to consider routine funding for Homeland Security by Jan. 30 or risk a partial shutdown in some operations. The GOP's version of the annual bill would provide about $92 billion for the agency, including $10 billion for ICE. A growing group of Democratic senators and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have had enough. They say they won't support additional funds without significant changes.

Lawmakers are considering various restrictions on ICE operations, including limiting arrests around hospitals, courthouses, churches and other sensitive locations and ensuring that officers display proper identification and refrain from wearing face masks.

""I think ICE needs to be totally torn down,"" said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on CNN over the weekend.

""People want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals,"" he said. And not what he called this ""goon squad.""

Big spending underway, but Trump falls short of goals

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has begun tapping the new money at its disposal. The department informed Congress it has obligated roughly $58 billion — most of that, some $37 billion, for border wall construction, according to a person familiar with the private assessment but unauthorized to discuss it.

The Department of Homeland Security said its massive recruitment campaign blew past its 10,000-person target to bring in 12,000 new hires, more than doubling the force to 22,000 officers, in a matter of months.

""The good news is that thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill that President Trump signed, we have an additional 12,000 ICE officers and agents on the ground across the country,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a December statement.

The department also announced it had arrested and deported about 600,000 people. It also said 1.9 million other people had ""voluntarily self-deported"" since January 2025, when Trump took office.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-minneapolis-immigration-mn-0945-00ab0e.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:01:13.387295

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said.
Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.
Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.
But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.","Frustrated with the way the country was headed, Pablo Payan cast a ballot for Donald Trump in 2024, mainly drawn to the Republican presidential candidate’s pledge to bring economic strength to the nation as well as an America First mindset.

The father of four from Merrillville usually favored Democrats in the past but was hoping for a nationwide change of direction. Less foreign aid. More border security. Lower inflation. Greater economic growth.

Yet roughly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Payan has buyer’s remorse.

“I did vote for Trump. But now I regret it,” Payan said. “He’s contradicting everything he said he would do. And now it’s extremism. And immigration. And racial profiling. And sending money to foreign countries.”

As the one-year milestone of the second Trump administration approaches, various polls indicate waning approval for the president compared with the higher ratings he had at the start of his second term.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed 42% of Americans approved of Trump’s job overall. This was up slightly from lower percentages throughout most of the fall and winter but still down from the 47% approval rating around the time Trump took office in January 2025.

While the president has kept his MAGA base largely intact, the Tribune interviewed several Trump voters who have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of his leadership during the first year of his second term.

Although they favored the president over Democrat Kamala Harris during the campaign, they now share grave concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of everything from economic strategies to foreign policy to domestic problems.

Aggressive immigration enforcement was a repeated complaint from those who backed the president during the election but now have doubts about his leadership. Chicago was the epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation policy this fall, an effort that relied heavily upon racial profiling and largely failed to target the “worst of the worst” criminals as promised.

One man from Skokie grew incensed after witnessing Border Patrol agents question U.S. citizens who were working on his property during an immigration enforcement onslaught across the Chicago area on Halloween.

A Navy combat veteran was angered after immigration officials detained his wife — a foreign-born green card holder — at O’Hare International Airport over the summer.

Payan, a 41-year-old general contractor whose parents were born in Mexico, said he believed campaign rhetoric that the administration would target felons and violent criminals who were here without legal permission, a mission he supported.

But the reality of immigration enforcement — which has included turbulent protests, detained U.S. citizens and the violent arrests of both residents who are legally in the U.S. and those without legal permission — has been a stark contrast to those promises.

“Going door to door, just asking people at the gas stations or at Home Depot, ‘Hey, what’s your status?’ That’s racial profiling at its best,” Payan said.

While there isn’t evidence of a mass exodus of Trump supporters, there are signs of weakening favor among those who cast a ballot for the president, said Alexander Theodoridis, associate professor and co-director of the UMass Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Of Trump voters polled in July, 69% expressed confidence in their choice and only 1% said they regretted their vote; 2% said they had some regrets and might make a different choice if they could go back, according to the UMass Poll.

Another 3% said they wished they hadn’t voted at all and 6% had mixed feelings, the survey found.

But 19% responded that they had some concerns about his presidency — a contingent the Trump administration and other Republicans might find troubling later this year in the midterm elections, which can reshape control of Congress, Theodoridis said.

Historically, the midterms often go against the incumbent party, he noted.

“We’re very likely to see it this time around too,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean lots of people are regretful of their Trump vote in an open or even self-aware way. But they might just not be enthusiastic enough to turn out and vote for … the Republican running for Congress in their district.”

The dip in support comes as some high-profile cracks are emerging among Trump’s often-lockstep base.

Once a loyal champion of the president, former U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has severely criticized Trump over his handling of files related to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as foreign policy and health care issues.

The feud intensified with Trump calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky,” while pledging to endorse a challenger if she sought reelection. Amid the public fallout, Greene announced her resignation in November and stepped down earlier this month.

Elon Musk, a top donor during the 2024 election and former leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, has posted a flurry of attacks on his X social media platform targeting the president’s handling of the Epstein files as well as spending and tariffs. He and the president seem to be on better terms now, as Musk recently shared a picture of them dining at Mar-a-Lago on social media.

And despite intense pressure from the White House, a group of Republican state senators from Indiana helped defeat a Trump-backed redistricting plan that would have favored their party.

Among them was northwest Indiana Republican state Sen. Michael Bohacek, 8th District, who threatened to vote against the redrawn congressional map after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual abilities in reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Bohacek, whose daughter has Down syndrome, rebuked the president’s offensive language and encouraged him to “use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”

As for Payan, he’s worried about the nation’s increasingly hawkish foreign policy, climaxing earlier this month with the U.S. capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s increasing desire to control Greenland.

“It’s the dictator blueprint,” he said.

Payan said he’s faced backlash from Democrats because he voted for Trump. He’s also been castigated by Republicans for opposing the president.

But he believes it’s everyone’s civic duty to criticize leaders when they’re wrong, even if it’s a candidate they supported during the election.

“Be vocal and express your voice,” he said. “A lot of people are scared to talk because they might get fired from work or their friends might unfriend them. And I think, what’s more important? Your voice or your relationship with your co-worker or friend?”

‘Poor choices’

While voting in person on Election Day in November 2020, Morgan Krupinski spent about five minutes holding his pen and grappling with the final decision at the top of his nearly completed ballot: The options for president, as Trump faced Democrat Joe Biden.

“I couldn’t do it,” he recalled. “I voted. But I abstained from the presidential choice. It’s kind of a reflection of where our leaders are. We have a lot of poor choices, many times.”

The 30-year-old who works in technology had voted for Trump in 2016 but grew disappointed by the end of his first term, as unrest gripped the country amid the COVID pandemic and protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Neither Trump nor Biden seemed equipped to lead at the time, he recounted.

Afterward, the Jan. 6, 2020, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol deeply upset Krupinski.

As the 2024 election approached, he highly favored another Republican candidate, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

He saw her as a strong leader who could help quell two major wars plaguing the globe — the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war — while uniting a largely fragmented United States.

But Haley, the last significant Republican challenger to Trump, withdrew her longshot candidacy in March 2024.

Then the July assassination attempt on Trump marked a turning point for Krupinski, who was moved by the candidate’s speech a few days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

“Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump told the crowd. “The discord and division in our society must be healed.”

That moment held echoes of President George W. Bush’s address following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and President Barack Obama’s words after the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden, two historical messages that had seemed to bring the nation together, Krupinski recalled.

So in 2024, he returned to his polling place and cast a hopeful vote for Trump.

Krupinski was gratified by some of the president’s international accomplishments, including a Trump-led plan for peace in Gaza in early October and release of the Israeli hostages by Hamas.

There were also concerns. Krupiniski criticized the administration’s steep tariffs, which “are not really a traditional Republican free-market issue.”

The self-described Reagan-style conservative grew troubled by “hyper-nationalistic rhetoric” among some in the MAGA contingent, which he believes Trump has an obligation to condemn.

But his worries for the new administration culminated on Halloween, when Trump’s often-combative immigration crackdown touched Krupinski’s home in Skokie.

While working inside his house, several Border Patrol vehicles suddenly pulled up on his quiet north suburban street.

Led by Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, a swarm of armed immigration agents filled the scene, demanding documents from two workers from an American company who were providing flood control on Krupinski’s front lawn.

They were able to provide proof that they were U.S. citizens. But the encounter disturbed Krupinski.

“I believe we need to have a strong border and we need to get rid of people who are committing crimes and who are doing the wrong thing,” he said. “But for that to happen in such a way that’s so indiscriminate: Going down residential streets and stopping people based on their appearance and what they’re doing, without a true, reasonable cause?”

Immigration officials had no reason to stop and question those workers, Krupinski added.

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said. “Now what I think is going on is a very strained and expansive view of the authority that they have. And it’s very unsettling.”

Many Chicago residents agree with him in the wake of the Trump administration’s local ramped-up immigration enforcement, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Almost 13% of those polled supported enforcement activities and more than 8% said they have not gone far enough; 14% of those surveyed were unsure.

Krupinski believes he made the best decision he could on Election Day in November.

Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.

Amid a highly polarized and divided political climate, they might be more inclined to listen to him than a staunch Democrat or more liberal voice, Krupinski reasoned.

“So I feel like I have a unique opportunity to speak to the people on my side of things,” he added. “I hope I can change people’s minds to say no one is above criticism and no one is above being called out when they do something bad, particularly in the government. This is the right we have as citizens.”

Partisan strife

The Missouri couple were returning home from a trip to Ireland for a family memorial when they were stopped by federal authorities at O’Hare International Airport in July.

Donna Hughes-Brown, an Irish citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by immigration authorities.

Although she’s been a green card holder for decades, Hughes-Brown said the officials cited two misdemeanor offenses against her for writing bad checks in 2012 and 2015.

The 58-year-old grandmother was held at O’Hare for several days and then transferred to a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, where she was detained for more than four months.

Her husband, Jim Brown, a Navy veteran who fought in Operation Desert Storm, had cast a ballot for Trump in 2024. But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.

“What they were doing to my wife was wrong,” said Brown. They live in northeastern Missouri about 20 miles from the Illinois border.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to Tribune requests for comment.

The case made international headlines and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers, including Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, advocated for Hughes-Brown’s release.

During a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing in December, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island grilled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the matter.

Brown attended the hearing as well.

“She did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks, totaling $80, 10 years ago. She is currently in prison and facing deportation,” Magaziner said during the hearing. “Ms. Noem, will you thank Mr. Brown for his service to our country?”

“Thank you, Mr. Brown, for your service to our country,” Noem responded.

The Homeland Security secretary added that it’s not her job to pick and choose which laws get enforced, though Noem did pledge to review the case.

In mid-December, Hughes-Brown was released and returned to her Missouri home. The couple are now working on the process for her to become a naturalized citizen.

“I’m relieved that Donna is finally back home with her family and look forward to supporting her in her naturalization journey, but she never should have been detained in the first place,” Duckworth said in a written statement.

During a recent interview with the Tribune, Brown had harsh words for the Trump administration.

“They sold a whole different idea than what’s actually happening. The cruelty and the nonsense that’s going on right now is just wrong,” he said. “If you watched between the first Trump presidency and now, it’s completely different. We’re trying to bully other countries and do things we shouldn’t be doing.”

Yet he stressed several times that he didn’t want to “get partisan,” noting that some immigration laws the administration’s enforcing have been on the books for years. Former President Obama, a Democrat, had been dubbed “the deporter-in-chief,” by immigration advocates, Brown correctly noted.

Since his wife’s story went viral, Brown said he’s been lambasted by liberals for voting for Trump and admonished by conservatives for criticizing the administration.

The only way to improve the country is “to stop being partisan,” Brown said, adding that he blames much of the nation’s strife on the two-party political system.

“It’s the fomentation,” he said. “When you fight with each other instead of coming up with a solution.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-trump-voters-year10.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:17.343274

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system.","Since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Congress has assigned primary responsibility for adjudicating federal employment disputes to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The board consists of three members appointed by the president, removable “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” To promote impartiality, no more than two members may belong to the same political party, and the board may act only with a two-member quorum.

Because the CSRA provides a comprehensive adjudicatory regime for employment disputes, employees generally must exhaust their claims before the MSPB prior to seeking judicial review in federal court. Claims submitted to the MSPB are adjudicated initially by an administrative judge. Either the government or the employee may appeal the administrative judge’s decision to the board. Then, only after the board issues a final decision may a federal employee seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The MSPB is a shell of its former self. Since President Trump’s inauguration, three developments have eroded any confidence that federal employees may have had in the MSPB’s independence and impartiality. First, in Harris v. Bessent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress may not prohibit the president from removing the MSPB’s board members, thereby upholding Trump’s removal of Chair Cathy Harris. Second, the MSPB lacked a quorum to review appeals from March to October 2025, leaving employees in procedural limbo and foreclosing the possibility of judicial review. Third, and finally, the Justice Department has argued that the MSPB is legally obligated to follow interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). If accepted, that position would permit the OLC to exert control over the MSPB’s interpretations of civil service law.

On Jan. 9, the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear Harris v. Bessent. The decision may represent the final nail in the coffin for the MSPB’s independence. Courts should no longer pretend that the MSPB operates as Congress intended. If Congress wishes to preserve independence in the adjudication of federal employment disputes, it must act legislatively—either by creating a court dedicated to civil service law or by permitting existing courts to hear such claims.

The President’s Removal Power

At the core of the MSPB’s unraveling lies a more fundamental shift in constitutional law: the steady expansion of the presidential power over administrative agencies. For much of the modern administrative state, Congress relied on for-cause removal protections to insulate adjudicatory agencies from direct presidential control. That settlement has been under pressure for more than a decade, as the Supreme Court cast increasing doubts on Congress’s authority to limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers.

Article II of the Constitution provides that “the executive power shall be vested in a President.” In Seila Law v. CFPB, the Supreme Court held that the president must have authority to remove principal officers who wield significant executive power, so that those officers “remain accountable to the President, whose authority they wield.” At the same time, the Supreme Court preserved a limited exception for officers serving on multimember commissions that exercise quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power, consistent with its earlier decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, however, indicated that the Court is poised to overturn—or at least substantially limit—Humphrey’s Executor.

The respective removals of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger and MSPB Chair Harris have brought these issues squarely to the forefront for agencies that govern the civil service. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision to stay an injunction restoring Dellinger’s position, Dellinger ended his lawsuit because he believed that his “odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.” Meanwhile, in Trump v. Wilcox¸ the Supreme Court stayed an order enjoining Harris’s removal, concluding that the government was likely to show that the MSPB “exercise[s] considerable executive power.” The Court declined, however, to address whether the MSPB falls within the exception for multimember commissions.

Following the Supreme Court’s order, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit held in Harris v. Bessent that removal protections for MSPB members violate Article II. Writing for the majority, Judge Gregory Katsas held that the MSPB exercises “substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers that Humphrey’s Executor deemed to be merely quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.” The panel stitched together several different precedents to narrow sharply—if not effectively hollow out—Humphrey’s Executor. In its view, Congress may delegate neither judicial nor legislative power, and, therefore, any power exercised by agencies within the executive branch must be executive in nature. Even so-called quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, the court reasoned, are executive in nature. Accordingly, the president must have the authority to remove any principal officer exercising significant quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power because these powers are executive in nature. On this logic, the majority speculated that “Humphrey’s Executor thus governs only agencies with purely advisory functions—like, say, the United States Commission on Civil Rights.” At the same time, the majority acknowledged that—unless and until the Supreme Court finally overturns it—Humphrey’s Executor still supports Congress’s power to impose removal protections on agencies that exercise the narrowest forms of quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power.

The panel adopted an exceptionally narrow understanding of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Under its reasoning, only the limited and historically contingent functions expressly identified in Humphrey’s Executor—such as advising Congress or acting as a judge-like adjudicator without policymaking authority—can fall within those categories. Modern forms of administrative adjudication and rule implementation, even when long understood as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative, are recharacterized as exercises of executive power simply because they occur within the executive branch.

Applying that framework, the D.C. Circuit panel concluded that the MSPB’s authority could not be described as plausibly quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. Emphasizing the board’s power to regulate the removal of its administrative law judges, issue final decisions, award reinstatement and back pay, and to represent itself in litigation, the court reasoned that the MSPB exercises significant executive power that places it squarely outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception. On this view, the board’s adjudicatory function is not analogous to the restrained model contemplated in 1935 but instead reflects modern administrative governance in which adjudication is inseparable from policymaking and enforcement.

The D.C. Circuit panel’s myopic conception of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power dramatically constrains Congress’s ability to insulate agencies from presidential control. By anchoring the constitutional analysis to a limited account of the Federal Trade Commission’s power in 1935, the decision ignores that the categories of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power predated Humphrey’s Executor and were understood more broadly at the time. Although the D.C. Circuit declined to “decide whether Congress may restrict the President’s ability to remove officers with solely adjudicatory functions,” its cramped understanding of what qualifies as quasi-judicial effectively resolves the question. Modern administrative adjudication—because it involves finality, remedial discretion, and the application of broad statutory standards—will almost always be reclassified as executive power, leaving Congress with little practical ability to design independent adjudicatory bodies within the administrative state. The decision by the full D.C. Circuit not to rehear Trump v. Bessent means that any effort to restore removal protections for the MSPB must come from the Supreme Court.

Some possibility remains that the Supreme Court may ultimately retain an exception from the president’s removal power for principal officers within adjudicatory agencies. During oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, several justices pressed the government on whether Congress retains authority to structure agencies that primarily adjudicate disputes, invoking historical examples of claims courts and other adjudicatory institutions designed to operate with independence. Those exchanges point toward a narrower—and more historically grounded—path: The Court could reject the D.C. Circuit’s efforts to collapse quasi-judicial power into the executive power, reaffirm that adjudication has long occupied a distinct constitutional space, and preserve Congress’s authority to protect principal officers who perform predominantly adjudicatory functions. Whether the Court is willing to take that path remains uncertain. But if it does not, the MSPB’s fate will stand as a warning that adjudication of federal employment disputes within the executive branch may no longer be constitutionally sustainable.

The OLC’s Efforts to Control MSPB Interpretations

The erosion of the MSPB’s independence has not occurred solely through structural attacks on removal protections for the board. It has also unfolded through a subtle campaign to subordinate the board’s legal interpretations to the Department of Justice, and ultimately to the president.

The Trump administration has advanced an expansive conception of the attorney general’s authority over legal interpretation. Although OLC opinions are binding on Cabinet departments, the OLC would not issue decisions binding independent agencies without their consent. President Trump, however, has ordered that “[t]he President and the Attorney General’s opinions of questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties,” including employees within independent agencies.

In recent filings, the Department of Justice has argued that the MSPB must obey the OLC’s precedents. In Jackler v. Department of Justice, the Justice Department argued that an OLC opinion issued in September 2025 “provides binding legal advice within the Executive Branch” and therefore must control the MSPB’s handling of constitutional questions in removal cases. The OLC’s opinion purports to overturn the MSPB’s decision in Davis-Clewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs. By the department’s account, because the OLC speaks for the executive branch, any MSPB decision inconsistent with the OLC’s interpretation “does not represent the legal position of the Executive Branch” and must be vacated or remanded. This is a striking claim. The MSPB is not a litigating component of the Justice Department, nor is it an executive department subject to the attorney general’s supervisory authority. Congress instead designed the board as an adjudicatory body meant to resolve disputes between agencies and employees—including the Justice Department itself—according to law. Treating the OLC’s views as binding on the MSPB collapses that adjudicatory function into the very chain of command whose actions the board is supposed to review.

If accepted, this model fundamentally alters the nature of MSPB adjudication. The CSRA presupposes that the MSPB will apply statutes and precedent neutrally, subject to judicial review—not that it will take direction from the OLC when the executive branch dislikes the board’s answers. Allowing the OLC to dictate legal interpretation of civil service laws deprives the MSPB of its independence and enables the OLC to construct precedents that are more favorable to agency employers. Structural removal protections matter little if the board’s legal reasoning is overridden through the Justice Department’s “guidance.” In that sense, the OLC’s asserted authority over MSPB interpretation completes the transformation already begun by attacks on removal protections: the conversion of an adjudicatory body into an instrument of presidential control.

The MSPB’s Quorum Problems

The removal power and the asserted authority to control the MSPB’s legal interpretations matter only if the board is permitted to function at all. With the expansion of the removal power, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—designed as a safeguard for deliberation and impartiality—has become a point of leverage to assert presidential control.

The MSPB can act only with a quorum of two members. When the president possesses at-will removal authority, that quorum requirement becomes fragile. By removing at least two members from the board, the president can break the agency’s quorum and halt its ability to issue decisions. As recent events illustrate, the president need not remove the entire board to paralyze it; selective removals or the refusal to fill vacancies can suffice. This dynamic converts the quorum rule from a protection of collective decision-making into a tool for preventing adjudication altogether.

The consequences for federal employees are severe. During periods without a quorum, employees can receive initial decisions from administrative judges, but if either party seeks board review, those cases stall indefinitely. In Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit treated the absence of a quorum as a temporary procedural defect rather than a structural denial of adjudication, leaving employees trapped in limbo.

This problem is not hypothetical. The MSPB has a long and troubling history of lacking a quorum. From January 2017 until March 2022, the board lacked a quorum for more than five years. During that period, the MSPB was unable to issue final decisions on petitions for review, producing a roughly 3,800 case backlog and leaving thousands of employees without timely resolution of claims involving removals, suspensions, and whistleblower retaliation. Although the MSPB adopted rules in 2024 to allow limited internal actions to proceed without a quorum, those measures did not—and could not—solve the core problem. The board still may not issue final, precedential decisions on petitions for review without two members and thus cannot perform its central function during quorum lapses.

The Senate confirmed a new MSPB member in October 2025, restoring its quorum. The relatively quick restoration prevented a similar backlog that resulted from 2017 to 2022, but the quorum’s restoration underscores a deeper structural vulnerability rather than resolving it. Because the president can now remove board members at will, party-balancing requirements offer little protection. A president might remove members of the opposing party, replace them with loyalists, or leave seats vacant long enough to prevent the board from acting. Even when a quorum technically exists, the threat of removal hangs over members, and the ease with which quorums are broken ensures that the MSPB’s capacity to function depends on presidential forbearance rather than statutory design.

In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control. Removal authority means quorums can be destroyed at will; the exhaustion doctrine prevents employees from escaping to federal court; and repeated historical failures show that these are not isolated or accidental breakdowns. Even when quorums are restored, the combination of removal power and partisan manipulation means that the MSPB’s ability to act remains contingent and fragile. Congress designed the MSPB to be an independent adjudicator. In practice, quorum fragility has converted it into an agency that can be silenced whenever its decisions become inconvenient.

The MSPB No Longer Functions as Congress Intended

The CSRA’s channeling and exhaustion regime rests on a specific legislative bargain: Congress would strip district courts of jurisdiction over most federal employment disputes and, instead, create a separate, independent adjudicator to decide those disputes before judicial review. Congress did not simply assign cases to “an agency.” It deliberately split the original agency tasked with personnel management—the Civil Service Commission—to separate the task of managing personnel from the task of adjudicating employment disputes. It created the independent MSPB precisely to eliminate the inherent conflict of having the government’s chief personnel office also serve as the appellate review in adverse actions.

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system. Independence was necessary to ensure that “the Board should be insulated from the kinds of political pressures that have led to violations of merit principles in the past.” Indeed, “[a]bsent the mandate for independence of the Merit Systems Protection Board, it is unlikely that the committee would have granted the Office of Personnel Management the power it has or the latitude to delegate personnel authority to the agencies.” In other words, without the MSPB’s independence, Congress would not have created the civil service system that we have today.

Those design choices are now eviscerated. If the president can remove MSPB members at will, then the statutory features Congress had treated as safeguards—partisan balancing, staggered terms, and decisional independence—become discretionary norms that survive only as long as the White House tolerates them. The same is true of the CSRA’s broader architecture.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently underscored that Congress’s decision to channel claims away from district courts was “predicated on the existence of a functioning and independent MSPB and Special Counsel,” and remanded for fact finding on whether that premise has been undermined. Contrary to the Federal Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez, the Fourth Circuit suggested that the MSPB no longer functioned as intended because it lacked a quorum and that the government had argued that the board’s removal protections violated the separation of powers. The Fourth Circuit explained that Congress’s jurisdiction-stripping design presupposes not just a process, but one capable of “adequate and independent review,” such that if key Senate-confirmed positions “go unfilled” or if the MSPB and special counsel cannot perform their duties, “the framework of the CSRA would be thwarted” and congressional intent “defeat[ed].” In other words, exhaustion and channeling make sense only if the adjudicatory institutions Congress created actually exist as Congress designed them.

If the MSPB is no longer structurally independent—or can be disabled through at-will removals and partisan restructuring—then the CSRA’s exhaustion regime risks becoming a one-way ratchet: Employees are barred from federal court on the theory that Congress provided an adequate substitute, even when that substitute no longer provides the neutral, functioning review Congress intended. At that point, Congress faces an unavoidable choice. One option is to take adjudication out of the executive branch entirely by creating an Article I court for civil service disputes. The other is more modest but immediate: Amend the CSRA to permit covered employees to proceed directly to federal district court (or to a specialized appellate path) when the MSPB lacks a quorum, cannot act in a timely fashion, or otherwise fails to provide the independent adjudication Congress designed. This all assumes that the civil service avoids the darkest possibility: a decision from the Supreme Court that the CSRA is wholly unconstitutional. Provided the administrative state weathers that possibility, Congress will need to restore the basic bargain that animated the CSRA.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/united-states-court-of-appeals-for-the-federal-circuit-washington-dc.jpg?sfvrsn=a99fcf49_5,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:13.728713

In today’s issue:

▪ 1 year of Trump 2.0

▪ Trump’s Greenland letter sparks blowback

▪ Cassidy charts path after presidential snub

▪ Putin gets Trump invite to join Gaza board

President Trump is taking a broad view of executive authority and showing no signs of slowing down on testing his own power as he enters his second year back in office.

Trump has faced off with Congress, the courts and various states as he pushes for a stronger presidential hand in his second term. He’s also increasingly focused on exerting his influence on the world stage.

The president will mark Tuesday’s anniversary of returning to office with an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich on “Katie Pavlich Tonight” airing at 10 p.m. EST, before jetting to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with world leaders and press his foreign agenda at the World Economic Forum.

Greenland and blowback to Trump’s campaign to secure the Danish territory will be top of mind for leaders at the forum, along with the president’s push to have countries join his “Board of Peace” to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

▪ The Hill: Trump starts year with Greenland tumult.

Trump’s foreign policy moves have captured much of the attention heading into the second year of his term, with the stunning U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro jumpstarting 2026 and surprising many people, including congressional leaders.

Democrats and some Republicans pushed back against the administration’s unilateral action and Trump’s initial suggestions the U.S. would take over Venezuela with Maduro ousted. Trump has seemingly backed off on the idea the U.S. would directly control Caracas, instead focusing more on ensuring a strong U.S.-Venezuelan relationship to gain access to the country’s large oil reserves.

But an effort for Congress to reassert its authority failed in the Senate after the White House pressured enough Republicans to back off a war powers resolution that aimed to prevent the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela. Even if it passed the Senate, it was likely dead on arrival in the House, making the resolution only symbolic.

And its failure raised more doubts about the potential for success of other war powers resolutions concerning Greenland, Colombia and Iran that some Democrats have floated.

At home, immigration enforcement is a priority for the president, and the most recent front in that battle has been Minnesota, particularly after the killing of a woman earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

Trump has in recent days threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to respond to ongoing protests following the killing, just the latest time he’s threatened to use the centuries-old law. And multiple reports indicate the Pentagon has ordered 1,500 active-duty troops to be ready for deployment in Minnesota.

If Trump goes through with invoking the law, it would almost certainly face legal challenges questioning his authority.

The Hill’s Rebecca Beitsch reports Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration with the most visible enforcement effort seen in the country’s history.

The administration has also targeted many who have legal status in the country, seeking to curtail ways to lawfully enter the U.S. Democrats have argued many of these actions have been unlawful, including the administration’s deportation of some migrants without allowing them an opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of gang ties.

But Beitsch notes much of the administration’s immigration push is just beginning, as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave ICE a major boost in funding to expand detention capacity.

▪ The Hill: Immigration crackdown gets poor marks from voters.

▪ The Hill: Trump’s suspension of naturalization ceremonies leaves citizens in limbo.

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigations into high-profile figures are also further fueling allegations Trump is pushing his administration to go after his opponents for political reasons.

The DOJ has historically had independence and a certain amount of distance from the White House to ensure legal integrity, but Trump has at times sidelined that to specifically call for certain political opponents to face charges.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became the latest figure to be under investigation from the DOJ, apparently concerning his congressional testimony about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters.

The DOJ is meanwhile still pursuing a case against former national security adviser John Bolton and challenging the dismissal of its cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Other top Democrats such as Sen. Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) have been referred to the DOJ for prosecution.

Trump has sought to distance himself from these probes while continuing to attack the subjects of them. But the announcement of an investigation into Powell adds to the trend of another high-profile Trump critic facing possible legal action.

The administration has also battled Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds over a video they made last year in which they urged U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA officer, said last week she’s under federal investigation while Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has vowed to fight the Pentagon’s efforts to demote his military rank over the video.

Smart Take with Blake Burman

Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to send the U.S. military to Minnesota. Ronald Vitiello, a senior adviser to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told me Monday night any action would be “conditions based.” I also asked about how long ICE could be on the ground in Minnesota. Vitiello said it could be months.

“It could be a long time. Look, this could get better immediately, if the state and local officials put their hand out and ask ICE to come into these institutions to help identify the criminal element that’s also in the country illegally and work directly with ICE to get them removed,” he said.

What’s clear is the focus on Minnesota isn’t going away anytime soon. ICE could be on the ground in a large capacity for a while, and Trump is calling for a renewed focus on the fraud in the state.

Leading the Day

GREENLAND BLOWBACK: International leaders, Democrats and some Republicans are slamming the president’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre tying the Nobel committee’s decision not to award him the 2025 peace prize to his ongoing push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.

Trump in the letter questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over the mineral-rich island territory. The letter was shared with multiple European ambassadors.

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump said, according to NewsNation, The Hill’s partner outlet.

Democrats denounced Trump’s comments. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the letter the “ramblings of a man who has lost touch with reality” and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said the U.S. is becoming the “enemy of the free world because a pathetic man got his feelings hurt.”

Some Republicans who are more willing to criticize Trump also chimed in.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) called the letter “very embarrassing conduct.”

Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), a sharp critic of Trump, said on the social platform X that the time has come to “move Gramps into a home” and let the “adults govern again.”

The physician to the late former Vice President Dick Cheney called for a congressional inquiry into Trump’s fitness for office in light of the letter.

Trump openly campaigned to receive the peace prize throughout last year, but the Nobel committee awarded it to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado instead.

Machado gave her prize to Trump when the two met at the White House last week, though the Nobel committee has said the award can’t be formally transferred.

Støre clarified in a statement to Bloomberg that the Norwegian government doesn’t award the Nobel Prizes.

Trump told reporters late Monday that he doesn’t care about the prize but rejected the idea that Norway doesn’t control the board.

“A very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize,” he said. “If anybody doesn’t think that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize, they’re just getting — they have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway.”

Trump also said he doesn’t expect pushback over Greenland from European leaders heading into the World Economic Forum this week in Switzerland.

“We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can’t protect it,” he said.

Trump was active on Truth Social overnight, posting multiple notes from foreign leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron said he and Trump are in line on Syria and can “do great things” in Iran but questioned his intentions in Greenland, according to the Trump-posted message. He offered to meet with Trump in Davos and for the two to have dinner in Paris before Trump returns to the U.S.

Rutte, meanwhile, said he would use his media engagements to highlight Trump’s work in Syria, Gaza and Ukraine and is committed to “finding a way forward” on Greenland, according to the message posted overnight.

The president also posted a mock image showing Canada, Venezuela and Greenland as part of the U.S.

Trump has ramped up his rhetoric about the U.S. acquiring Greenland in recent weeks, refusing to rule out taking it by force. He threatened several European countries, including Denmark and Norway, with a 10 percent tariff beginning Feb. 1 if Greenland isn’t ceded to the U.S.

Those tariffs would rise to 25 percent if a deal still hasn’t happened by June 1.

International officials have taken Trump’s threats seriously and have rejected the idea of the U.S. taking Greenland.

The NATO secretary-general met with Danish and Greenlandic officials Monday to discuss “collective security,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with members of Congress to discuss various issues, including Trump’s rhetoric on the subject.

On Monday, amid rising tensions in the region, the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) clarified that activities it is conducting at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland have been long-planned and coordinated with Denmark. NORAD noted that the government of Greenland was also aware of the activities.

SHUTDOWN WATCH: Lawmakers have two weeks left to avoid a partial government shutdown but face a contentious battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Congress has passed six of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government before funding runs out Jan. 30. The House has approved an additional two-bill package to fund the State and Treasury departments, which the Senate will take up when it returns next week.

But that leaves four bills for the House to clear, and the one for DHS is expected to be heated as critics push back over ICE’s tactics. Some Democrats have signaled they wouldn’t support a bill to fund the department without reforms requiring tougher oversight of ICE.

Lawmakers could pass another continuing resolution to fund the government until they can reach a deal and stave off the second shutdown in just a few months. But timing is tight, as the Senate is out of town this week and the House will be out next week, The Hill’s Sudiksha Kochi reports.

CASSIDY PLOWS ON: Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) is vowing to continue with his reelection bid but is facing the toughest challenge to his political career after Trump weighed in to encourage a primary opponent to run against him.

Trump backed Rep. Julia Letlow (R-La.) for the seat in a post on Truth Social over the weekend, calling her a “total winner” and saying she would continue to deliver for Louisiana in the Senate as she has in the House. Letlow hasn’t announced a Senate candidacy but signaled after the endorsement that she may jump in the race.

“I’m honored to have President Trump’s endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,” she wrote in a post on X. “This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.”

The endorsement comes years after Cassidy was one of a handful of Republicans who broke with their party to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for his conduct leading up to and during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Since then, Cassidy has toed a line between criticizing and defending Trump and his administration.

Despite having cast a key vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services last year, Cassidy has become increasingly vocal criticizing Kennedy’s decisions in the role.

Cassidy already had picked up a few primary challengers, including state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. But Trump’s endorsement would be a critical boost for Letlow if she runs and would present an even larger obstacle for Cassidy, whose reelection chances already seemed in doubt.

Still, Cassidy expressed confidence in his ability to win.

“I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win,” he wrote on X.

Letlow has until Feb. 13 to file her candidacy if she wants to run.

DOJ WEIGHS GUN POLICY SHIFT: The DOJ is considering loosening gun regulations as it tries to boost support from Second Amendment advocates, The Washington Post reports.

Some of the changes include easing restrictions on the private sale of guns and loosening regulations around shipping firearms, people familiar with the changes told the Post. Other changes could affect the types of firearms that can be imported and making licensing fees refundable.

The exact changes and the timing of the announcement are still being finalized, according to the report.

The Post reported the back-and-forth emphasizes the DOJ’s challenges as it tries to satisfy members of Trump’s base who believe the administration hasn’t been strong enough in rolling back gun restrictions while also protecting the law enforcement abilities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

TILLIS ‘UNTETHERED’: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has increasingly become a leading voice within the GOP opposing Trump’s actions after having announced he won’t run for reelection this year.

Tillis announced last summer, amid the battle over the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that he wouldn’t run for another term. The announcement came as Trump repeatedly attacked Tillis’s opposition to the legislation, which the senator ultimately voted against.

But the past few weeks have given Tillis several opportunities to speak his mind, including on Trump’s rhetoric on Greenland, the DOJ investigation into Powell and how White House aides are advising Trump, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports.

Tillis told Bolton in an interview that his outspokenness isn’t a conscious choice but is a result of the administration’s actions.

“The sheer volume of things that are on the threat matrix,” Tillis said. “It sort of ramped up, but you’ve got to respond when the opportunities come up.”

But Tillis’s decision has given him an amount of freedom that few others can have.

“He’s untethered,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.

PUTIN INVITED: Russian President Vladimir Putin is among the world leaders invited to join the “Board of Peace” led by Trump to oversee the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Putin received an invitation to join the board, and officials are studying the details of the proposal. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia hopes to contact the U.S. to clarify “all the nuances,” according to the state-run news outlet RIA Novosti.

Other countries invited to join the board include the United Kingdom, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and India. France was invited, but French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Trump’s offer to join over the charter’s language.

The invitation for Putin comes nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been trying to reach a peace agreement to propose to Putin, a deal has remained elusive.

The Trump administration signaled last week that it is launching the second phase of the Gaza peace deal after the near-completion of the first phase. The second phase includes Hamas giving up power in Gaza and agreeing to disarm, though the militant group has given mixed messages as to whether it will follow through.

The White House announced the founding members of the board Friday. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, billionaire investor Marc Rowan and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.

The board will become official after three member states approve the charter.

The Closer

And finally … Sen. Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) is set to provide Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) with cafecitos after the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the University of Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday.

Ahead of the game, Moody posted a video saying she would wager her congressional team showing up to Banks’s office with cafecitos, a Cuban espresso beverage and South Florida staple, if her Hurricanes lost. Banks responded that he would provide Moody’s office with gummy bears if the Hoosiers lost.

The bet is far from the first time members of Congress engaged in friendly wagers over their sports teams. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey on the Senate floor last year, in a bet with the two Pennsylvania senators, after his Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl.

Trump attended the game along with a few members of the administration and his family.

Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.

The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.

Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.

“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”

Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.

The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.

“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.

In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.

In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.

The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.

Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”

The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”

“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.

Coughlin’s office did not comment on Murphy’s veto. Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0JS13095_1-2048x1329.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:02:32.255425

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency.","The United States Postal Inspection Service sometimes claims to be the oldest federal law-enforcement agency, arguing that its origin dates to 1775 when Benjamin Franklin, in his capacity as colonial postmaster general, first appointed a surveyor to audit the mail. Then in 1789, the country established both the U.S. Marshals as part of the original Judiciary Act and also a U.S. Customs Service to enforce the tariff laws that, at the time, provided the bulk of revenue.

Then in 1791, George Washington created the Park Watchmen to provide security for the under-construction capital of Washington, D.C.

The watchmen evolved into what is today the U.S. Park Police, who do not police America’s national parks (that would be the National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers) but rather urban parks that are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. That means the National Mall and a bunch of other parks in D.C., but also some facilities in New York and San Francisco.

After the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln created the U.S. Secret Service to combat the rising problem of counterfeiting. After William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Congress decided that presidents needed protection, and they assigned that duty to the Secret Service.

Because the original mission of the Secret Service was to combat counterfeiting, it was housed in the Treasury Department. The Customs Service was also in the Treasury Department because its core mission was collecting taxes. And when the Justice Department decided in the early 20th century to beef up federal investigative capabilities, they chose not to expand existing federal law-enforcement agencies and instead spun up their own Bureau of Investigation, which evolved into today’s F.B.I.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency. The point is that it is a tangled web. The different agencies have narrow scopes and are also gerrymandered in weird ways. Bank robbery is handled by the same agency as counterterrorism but a different agency from counterfeiting, which is the same agency that does presidential protection, which is a different agency from protecting federal buildings.

I don’t think this makes a ton of sense compared to the setup they have in, say, Germany where the Bundeskriminalamt does detective-type stuff and the Bundespolizei does “guys in uniforms”-type stuff and that’s it.

And I’ve always felt it would make a lot of sense to reorganize the entire federal law-enforcement apparatus into either a single U.S. Police Service or else a dual structure with a German-style split. I first wrote about this back in 2012, prompted by an unrelated federal-government-reorganization proposal.

Which is just to say that my longstanding view is that we should, in fact, abolish ICE.

A federal judge refused to block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring members of Congress to give a week’s notice before visiting immigration detention facilities.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., comes after Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she and other Minnesota lawmakers were kicked out of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis on Saturday, Jan. 10. They were asked to leave the facility after being informed about the Trump administration rule governing lawmaker visits.

Plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress asked Cobb to intervene, but the judge ruled Monday that they used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new Department of Homeland Security action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" Cobb wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK JUDGE TO BLOCK NOEM'S REVIVED ICE VISIT RULE, SAY DHS DEFIED COURT ORDER

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement, according to The Associated Press.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after Reps. Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

ILHAN OMAR KICKED OUT OF ICE FACILITY AFTER DHS REQUIRES WEEK'S ADVANCE NOTICE

House Democrats asked the judge earlier this month to block the new directive from Noem requiring advance notice for congressional oversight visits to ICE detention facilities, arguing in a court filing that the policy is politically motivated and violates federal spending law and a prior court stay.

Last year, Democrats had sued to block the seven-day notice requirement, arguing that the restrictions on ICE detention centers violate Section 527, a federal spending law provision that prohibits DHS from using appropriated funds to prevent congressional access to these facilities.

In December, Cobb temporarily stayed the DHS restrictions from taking force ""[u]nless and until Defendants show that no Section 527 funds are being used for these purposes.""

Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the ""two convicted sex offenders"" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping U.S.

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

Here are the themes that have shaped his first 365 days in office.

Slashing the federal workforce and agencies

Elon Musk was initially the face of the president's vow to cut waste, fraud and abuse in government. He and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took a chainsaw to the federal workforce through buyouts, reductions in force and shuttering offices. Those efforts resulted in the loss of more than 317,000 federal employees by November, although that was offset by 68,000 hires, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some jobs were reinstated after court challenges.

DOGE also claimed to have cut billions in federal spending, although CBS News' analysis found the savings were a fraction of what was claimed.

Agencies that didn't align with Mr. Trump's mission were targeted for cuts or elimination, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The president is also trying to fire nearly every employee of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing it has overstepped its mission. ""RIP CFPB,"" Musk posted on X in February. In December, a judge blocked the White House from defunding the agency.

The Trump administration is currently trying to dismantle the Education Department and transfer many of its programs to other departments, arguing that doing so will help return education decisions to states.

The attorney general has also gutted the Justice Department office that prosecuted public corruption cases.

The Trump administration announced it would eliminate 20,000 jobs from the Health and Human Services Department, about a quarter of its workforce. The cuts included 1,300 who were fired from the National Institutes of Health, as well as $2 billion in funding. Public health agencies have also slashed funding for vaccine development and mental health and addiction programs, although some cuts were reversed. The president also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization.

Nonetheless, overall federal spending has not decreased under Mr. Trump. According to federal data analyzed by the Peterson Foundation, outlays in December 2025 were $5 billion higher than in December 2024. The national debt continues to climb.

Settling scores with political foes, targeting rivals — and rewarding allies

The Trump-era Justice Department has targeted the president's political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.

Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.

The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow ""illegal orders."" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is a retired Navy captain.

The Federal Reserve has also fallen into the administration's crosshairs, after the president has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower interest rates. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, said the Federal Reserve was recently served subpoenas over his testimony about renovations at the central bank's headquarters, and said the move was part of a pressure campaign. The president has also sought to fire Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging her ouster, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week. Powell is expected to attend.

Over the summer, the Justice Department fired dozens of employees who worked on special counsel Jack Smith's dual investigations into Mr. Trump.

The White House also revoked the security clearances of many officials, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Biden's national security team, Bolton and other current and former national security figures.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power to wipe away criminal charges from allies and political figures of his choosing.. He pardoned nearly everybody charged or convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on his first day in office, and he granted clemency to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former GOP Rep. George Santos, former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojavich and former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Carrying out mass deportations and immigration enforcement

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.

The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.

Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.

In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.

Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.

Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.

The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.

Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told ""60 Minutes"" in November the immigration raids ""haven't gone far enough.""

Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy

Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.

In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called ""Operation Midnight Hammer."" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.

Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.

In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.

Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's ""Donroe Doctrine,"" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.

But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts — telling several countries he no longer feels ""an obligation to think purely of Peace"" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.

The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.

Reshaping economic policy, focusing on trade and a love for tariffs

Mr. Trump calls himself ""the tariff king,"" and his love for tariffs — what he's called his ""favorite word"" — has reshaped international trade and international relations. Mr. Trump insists tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars for the country, although economists say U.S. consumers will ultimately pay higher prices. Studies show that U.S. importers generally pay the tariffs, not the foreign countries.

The stock market has continued to climb under Mr. Trump, although inflation, unemployment, hiring and layoff data are a mixed bag. Nearly three in four Americans say the president isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and just over three in four Americans say their income isn't keeping up with inflation, according to the latest CBS/YouGov poll.

New U.S tariffs on Chinese goods set the stage for a trade war between the world's largest economies over everything from computer chips and rare earth metals to soybeans and TikTok, briefly sending both countries' tariffs on each other to over 100%. Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.

The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the ""big, beautiful bill,"" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.

Pushing the limits of presidential power

Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington has passed few pieces of major legislation, with Mr. Trump relying heavily on executive actions to accomplish his objectives. He signed 228 executive orders — not including other types of executive actions — in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.

The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.

The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela — and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities — have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power. The Supreme Court blocked a Guard deployment to Chicago last month.

After an impasse in Congress led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the White House tested the limits of its power to unilaterally move money around. It kept sending out paychecks to members of the military and FBI agents, sought to lay off thousands of idled government workers and threatened to pause food stamp payments, drawing legal challenges.

Bending institutions to his will

Another theme of Mr. Trump's presidency continues to be pushing institutions to bend to his will. The president has terminated government contracts and revoked security clearances with major law firms that represented political opponents. The American Bar Association sued over the approach, calling it a ""law firm intimidation policy."" Some firms, under pressure, reached agreements with the administration to spend millions of dollars on pro bono work.

Mr. Trump has pressed both federal agencies and private employers to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and his administration has targeted what it views as ""woke"" initiatives in the military, business, education and other aspects of American society.

The Trump administration threatened to sue or otherwise pressured universities over their diversity and inclusion practices, pro-Palestinian campus protests or granting of in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, cutting off funding to some schools. Columbia University settled with the administration to avoid further investigations, and Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University and UPenn all reached some type of agreement with the administration.

The president has also personally sued multiple news organizations over their coverage. Ahead of the inauguration, ABC News parent Disney agreed to pay $16 million to settle a defamation suit Mr. Trump brought. CBS News was also among those the president sued, and then Paramount, CBS News' parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a suit over a 2024 ""60 Minutes"" interview with Kamala Harris. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.

Dealmaking with companies and countries

Rather than imposing uniform policy through legislation, the president prides himself on making deals — the more deals the better — with individual companies and nations. The tariff negotiations with different rates for various countries are a prime example of that.

The president has sought to broker individual deals with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the prices of drugs for Americans. Among the medications that could be sold direct-to-consumer at lower costs are GLP-1 weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.

The president has also unveiled deals to invest in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure with tech giants like Apple, Meta and OpenAI as well as trading partners like South Korea and Japan — though some of the corporate investments predated Mr. Trump.

The administration sought to broker a deal for TikTok's China-based parent company to sell its American operations to U.S. investors, avoiding a legally mandated nationwide ban on the social network. It's not yet clear if the deal will be approved by Chinese officials.

Mr. Trump let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, but with a ""golden share"" that allows the president to review some major corporate decisions.

Putting his stamp on the White House and Washington, D.C.

The president has moved to make his imprint on the White House itself and Washington, D.C., as a whole, forging ahead with plans to build a large ballroom on the grounds of the executive mansion and construct a new triumphal arch to match other major monuments.

Mr. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House in October with little warning, paving the way for his ballroom project. Architects working on the ballroom presented plans to a board that oversees construction on federal land earlier this month. The president has said the cost of the project, which has ballooned to roughly $400 million, will be covered by private donations. Some of those donations have come from firms and individuals with extensive business before the federal government.

Mr. Trump has renovated other parts of the White House, including by building a patio in the Rose Garden, installing massive new flagpoles on the grounds, redecorating the Oval Office with gold-colored furnishings and installing a ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" with photos of his predecessors — except former President Joe Biden, who is represented by an image of an autopen.

Mr. Trump has also touted plans for the construction of a triumphal arch across the Potomac River in Virginia. Mockups of the arch the president showcased in October bore the title ""Independence Arch.""

The president has also worked to affix his name to institutions around the capital. Mr. Trump's handpicked board of the Kennedy Center, Washington's premier arts venue, voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, a change that would require Congress to become official.

The administration also added Mr. Trump's name to the U.S. Institute of Peace in December. The State Department said the change was meant to ""reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/19/68da839b-011c-4506-8f0b-d4d737921bad/thumbnail/1200x630/0255f385cde8db0f2e3a9132d7381bc4/ap26016654582380.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:45.573183

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts.
Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding.
A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.
Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.","After the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month, congressional Democrats have demanded that any new DHS funding come with conditions to crack down on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, even as many Democratic voters call for defunding the agency.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that ends in September, while reducing the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would mandate that DHS use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on diffusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, acknowledged that the legislation does not include some of the “broader reforms Democrats proposed,” such as preventing DHS from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens or blocking the department from using other agencies’ personnel for immigration enforcement.

“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” DeLauro said in a statement, adding that House Republicans have committed to holding a separate vote on DHS funding in the package. “I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency.”

Democrats note that federal cash would stop flowing to other agencies, including TSA and FEMA, if Congress allows DHS funding to lapse, while the Trump administration could continue funding ICE with the pot of $75 billion Republicans enacted for immigration enforcement through the party-line tax and spending package they enacted last summer. The other alternative — running DHS on a stopgap funding patch — would maintain the status quo for money and policy while giving the Trump administration more discretion in how to use DHS cash.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts. To accomplish that, the bill reduces the amount of money the department can transfer and suspends DHS power to shift money if the department doesn’t comply with transparency requirements.

The legislation rejects many of the funding cuts the Trump administration sought but does not substantially increase the budgets of major domestic agencies besides the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The bill includes $84.3 billion for HUD, a $7.2 billion boost that amounts to about 9 percent over the department’s current budget.

Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.

Tacked on to the funding package is bipartisan health care legislation that includes a crackdown on drug intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers, renewals of several public health programs and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for community health centers.

The deal does not address the Obamacare subsidies that lapsed on Jan. 1, nor does it address most of the proposals in a White House health framework released last week. Most parts of the deal had a shot at becoming law in December 2024 but were torpedoed by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

Congress has 10 days to clear the package for Trump’s signature before federal funding is set to lapse for the programs it covers, which account for more than 70 percent of the cash lawmakers approve each year to keep federal agencies running.

Because the Senate is in recess this week, the chamber will need to pass the legislation when senators return the last week of January if Congress is going to head off another funding lapse.

Within the stopgap funding patch enacted in November, lawmakers approved a full year of funding for the departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, as well as the operations of Congress and the FDA. Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5a%2Fc2%2F1ab7a3074a46b263b0fbfd2c0be7%2Fu-s-congress-28265.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:49.418115

An Open Letter to Tech Companies

To the executives and board members of United States tech companies,

We have seen how the current administration is pressuring tech companies to limit efforts to fight the spread of mis- and disinformation, to forgo critical AI safeguards in favor of moving quickly, and to ignore the potential negative impacts your products, tools and services may have on the civil rights of your users. On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 240 organizations dedicated to protecting the rights of all people in the United States, and our Center for Civil Rights and Technology we implore you: do not capitulate to this pressure, and stay true to the values that your customers and users count on.

People are looking to you for leadership. We call on you to take this opportunity to be on the right side of history and to do what is best for not only your users, but also for the business interests that drive innovation and result in products and services that we all can trust.

Our recommendations:

As leaders shaping the future of technology, you are facing a defining moment: the rise of AI is an opportunity for the industry to flex its muscle and build new, innovative products that work for everyone. Proactively promoting principles around equity, fairness, and efficiency will help guarantee success:

Prioritize user experience: Engage in content moderation. Content moderation allows you to improve user experiences and retain advertisers. If your technology enables violence, threats, harassment, defamation, doxxing, and toxicity, your users can and will seek out alternatives to your product, and advertiser spending will follow. Likewise, if your technology empowers disinformation, deepfakes, voter suppression, and other anti-democratic and unpatriotic efforts, your users will cease to trust you and your product.

In order to be trustworthy, content moderation needs to be transparent: moderated content should always be coupled with a specific rationale. It needs to be responsive to reality, which requires an understanding of context beyond the current capabilities of AI. In order to be trustworthy, it must be done with human oversight. These humans should be employees, not contractors, and should be granted all of the respect and protections awarded to any other employee. Outsourcing content moderation to your users through crowdsourced models like Community Notes is not enough. As private companies, you have a legal right and a responsibility to your users to decide what is published on your platforms.

Prioritize user safety: Implement AI with care. Developing and deploying AI should be done thoughtfully, safely, transparently, and equitably. Adhering to these principles means monitoring AI for bias, making AI tools accessible to researchers, disclosing training data, and other reasonable efforts to minimize the black box effect. Our recently published Innovation Framework: A Civil Rights Approach to AI offers a step-by-step guide for implementing these values throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.

There are already countless instances of AI causing harm: biased AI systems in essential sectors – like banking, healthcare, housing, education, and justice – have resulted in people being denied mortgages, being pushed out of housing, being passed over for educational opportunities, and being wrongfully arrested. You have the power to say “no more.”

Prioritize user civil rights: Show us with actions, not words.

It may feel expedient to cooperate with the current administration to avoid retribution, but our communities have long memories, and we will remember what you do right now. Your employees will remember. Consumers will remember. Making the right decisions today will build lasting trust with your users.

Show us you’re with us with your actions, not only your words. One clear action you can take is this: Do not give this administration, or any future administration, technology or consumer data that can be weaponized against our communities. Nowhere is this clearer than with immigration enforcement, where the administration is relying on surveillance technology and consolidation of our most personal data to target and disappear our family members, friends, and neighbors. This is only possible with the proactive collaboration of companies like yours.

We also urge you to be true partners in supporting comprehensive data privacy measures that protect consumers from unwarranted intrusion and harms from companies and government alike. These actions are not only the right things to do; they are the best long-term business decisions.

Civil rights are not a constraint; they are a catalyst for sustainable growth, innovation, and widespread beneficial impact. As leaders of major tech companies, you have the power – and the opportunity – to make products that change the world for the better.

Our rationale:

The Trump administration’s push to centralize authority under the banner of “efficiency” raises serious questions about its long term intentions. With significant influence now exerted over regulatory bodies, including previously independent agencies, Congress, and the judiciary, it is not surprising that it has now turned its attention to the private sector – particularly the tech industry, which holds immense sway over public discourse, innovation, and our daily activities.

The administration’s attempts to exert authority over the tech industry is a significant development, especially since it is leveraging federal agencies like the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission to attempt to shape industry behavior in ways that harm people.

However, regulatory pressure appears to be only part of the strategy. Another dynamic is emerging, one in which companies are encouraged to seek approval or favor from the administration to avoid potential consequences and obtain federal contracts. This creates a climate of uncertainty, where alignment with political interests is becoming a prerequisite for stability. Some companies have capitulated to this pressure – not necessarily out of agreement, but out of caution. This dynamic has not been lost on the public.

It is vital that companies recognize this pattern and consider its implications in both the short and long terms. Your choices today about how your products adhere to civil rights will affect not only your users’ trust in technology, but the long-term viability of your businesses and the technology industry as a whole. You must consider the consequences, not just for your business and your autonomy, but for the broader health of the societal norms that allow your business to thrive.

For these reasons, civil rights must be a strategic priority:

Trust is the foundation of user engagement. Technology is facing heightened scrutiny as users want more transparency, fairness, and respect. The Leadership Conference’s Civil Rights Monitor and a recent Pew survey found that people are increasingly worried about AI. Safeguards around privacy, speech, and equity show users that your company is taking their concerns seriously, which builds loyalty, reduces churn, and strengthens brand reputation across diverse US communities.

Innovation depends on inclusion. Practices like minimizing risks, making equitable platforms, considering AI’s impact on marginalized communities, building representative workforces, and ensuring the technology works for all do not hinder innovation; they unlock it. Inclusion and diversity foster creative and safe environments, help to identify and mitigate harmful risks, and simply put, enable companies to build better products.

Proactive leadership drives business success. Building products that respect the rights of individuals, families, and society is not only the right thing – it is the smart thing. By embedding safeguards now, your companies will stay ahead of governments around the world that are shifting compliance standards to protect their citizens. You will avoid costly litigation and position yourselves and the United States as global leaders who set standards for others to follow. By making careful decisions on who you do business with now – and who you prioritize in divisive times – you will show your users where you stand and foster long-term success.

Let us ensure that your technologies and the way we use them reflect the values we all stand for. A better world is possible, and it is your responsibility to help humanity get there. We would welcome further discussion: please email techcenter@civilrights.org.

In this first year, the ACLU-D.C. along with our partners and brave clients, filed twelve lawsuits to defend our rights and liberties from the Trump administration. We’ve sued to stop unlawful immigration arrests because no one should live in fear of being targeted and abducted every time they walk their kids to school, head to work, or go see a doctor. We've filed lawsuits to stop other egregious abuses of power against immigrants’ rights as well. We sued to stop the administration from detaining people in inhumane conditions at the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison and deporting people without a fair process – and even with no process, as was the case for hundreds of people shipped off to a Salvadoran torture prison. We've also sued to protect the right to free speech, the right to vote, and the right to be free from discrimination.

This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses.","Labor unions, community leaders and faith groups are calling for an economic blackout in Minnesota on Friday to protest the surge of federal immigration agents in the state and mourn Renee Good.

Organizers are urging Minnesotans not to work, shop or go to school. The Trump administration has dispatched some 3,000 federal agents to the state, in what it claims amounts to its largest enforcement operation thus far, amid a broader crackdown on immigration.

More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot Good, 37, in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“There is an unprecedented and outrageous attack being waged against the people of Minnesota. I have never seen anything like it in my life,” said Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 in Minneapolis. “This is just an outrageous acceleration and escalation of violence toward working-class people.”

The CWA, which represents workers in the state at companies including AT&T, Activision and DirecTV, is one of several local unions organizing and supporting the planned economic blackout.

Others include Unite Here Local 17, Saint Paul Federation of Educators and Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said: “Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families. Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.”

“I think what generated the idea for this action comes out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” said Knutson. “The government in the state of Minnesota has not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”

Knutson expressed hope that “the CEOs of all these corporations that are based in Minnesota take notice”.

Large US corporations headquartered in Minnesota include Target, Best Buy, United Healthcare and General Mills. None immediately returned requests for comment.

As the administration continues to send ICE agents to the Minnesota region, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has complained in recent days that the city’s police are outmanned and outgunned.

“Can our cops arrest them? From a legal perspective, yes,” he said during an interview on the Bulwark podcast. “From a practical perspective, to state the reality, it does get kind of hard when they drastically outnumber us, and they have bigger guns than we do. We don’t want to create warfare in the street.”

A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said. “Those of us in the trade union movement understand the leverage and power that our labor has, and we are going to try and use that, because really there’s nothing else left,” he told the Guardian. “The idea is that we use our collective power to show those that rule this country and those that profit off of our labor that there’s a cost to attacking our communities this way.”

Organizers held a press conference last Tuesday, outside of the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, to announce that the event, which will also include a march and rally in the city’s downtown at 2pm local time.

“On Friday, January 23, we are calling for a day of truth and freedom,” said JaNaé Bates Imari, a minister and co-executive director of the multi-faith non-profit Isaiah. “It is a day where every single Minnesotan who loves this state and this notion of truth and freedom will refuse to work, to shop, and to go to school. What we have experienced and are experiencing in the state of Minnesota is not normal.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the planned economic blackout.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: “The fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.”

The spokesperson reiterated the administration’s claim that Good “weaponized” her car before the shooting. This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

The DHS spokesperson added that “if these community and faith leaders wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable”, they would stand with federal law enforcement officers, whom the spokesperson claimed have faced a sharp increase in assaults and vehicle attacks. They did not provide evidence for this allegation.

“These men and women are moms and dads who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from the dangerous criminal illegal aliens in their communities,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a5229a0c721430b47dc7f4031d75e65e30aabd/244_0_5200_4160/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945ba541da6da6c21d4b97d27780a047",N,,2026-01-20 12:00:01.274990

We mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing.

The strategy paid off. We’re not just challenging the Trump administration’s policies — at the national and local level we're successfully thwarting their plans.

On day one, when Trump issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, we filed a case within two hours.

When the government began arresting non-citizen students and scholars for their speech, we moved quickly to challenge their detention and secure their release.

As Congress made multiple attempts to block access to critical health care for trans people, we worked relentlessly on the Hill to block these provisions from becoming law.

Here at NorCal, our efforts to interrupt the incessant abuse of power by the administration have also paid off. Here are just two examples.

We filed a class action lawsuit challenging Trump policy that allowed ICE to arrest immigrants when they show up for mandatory court hearings. A federal district court in San Francisco has blocked these arrests while our lawsuit proceeds. With this ruling, people can pursue their asylum and immigration cases without fear of detention.

We filed a lawsuit against Meta (a.k.a. Facebook) to prevent turning over personal information of our client who documented ICE raids in Los Angeles.

A YEAR OF ATTACKS AND RESILIENCE

(New York, NY) – Today marks one year since the second inauguration of President Trump, a year defined by the dramatic escalation of abusive attacks on immigrants and the rule of law. Civil society organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) have been at the forefront of the pushback to protect immigrant communities in the United States, recognizing that attacks on immigrants are attacks on all of us and indeed on democracy itself.

This year, IRAP has challenged in court the unlawful suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the transfer to and detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay, the total abandonment of Afghan allies, and the attempted termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syria and Burma. IRAP’s advocacy prevented thousands of TPS holders from being stripped of their ability to live and work legally in the United States, and secured the entry and resettlement of many already-approved refugees left in limbo by the suspension of USRAP.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of IRAP:

“A year ago today, President Trump signed an Executive Order indefinitely suspending the United States refugee program. While we have been in court ever since fighting to restore this critical lifeline for refugees fleeing violence and persecution, the government has only intensified its brutal assault on immigrants and those who support them.

The Trump administration is now subjecting refugees and immigrants living in the United States and their communities to the same kind of abuses many refugees once fled. Guided by xenophobia and racism, the Trump administration is targeting all immigrants, regardless of their legal status, deep community connections, or criminal record. This is not just an attack on immigrants; it is an attack on American communities and ideals that makes everyone less safe.

In just the last two weeks, we have been horrified to see armed ICE agents arrest and detain refugees with absolutely no claim that they have broken any law. These are dangerous times full of immense challenges, but we will not back down. IRAP will continue to fight every day for the right of every person to live in peace, safety, and dignity. Increasingly, our democracy depends on it.”

But the celebration for the achievements of the slain 60s civil rights leader was tempered by contemporary anxieties over racial and social equality and Trump administration’s crackdown in Minneapolis.

At a rally in Harlem, the Rev Al Sharpton referred to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother of three who was killed by an immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“If she cursed them out does that give them the right to shoot her?” he asked. “Now they’re talking about sending in the national guards, sending in more ICE agents. We are in a state that Dr King would have been fighting against this country going this far.”

Sharpton called for a broad sense of unity, saying that “if people are on our side, we can disagree without being disagreeable because we have folks that are adversarial to the interests of our community.

“We need to make a pledge on King Day that we gonna fight and make what should happen to preserve the dream of Dr King,” he added.

Zohran Mamdani, the newly installed New York City mayor, framed inequality as an economic issue at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual MLK Day celebration.

“While the city is wealthy beyond measure, it is also deeply unequal,” he said. “Some New Yorkers sleep in penthouses. Others sleep on the sidewalk below.

“We cannot only speak of Dr King’s legacy as if it is a legacy of rights that can be given to people,” he said. “It must also be a legacy of rights that those people can exercise themselves.”

In Washington, hundreds of people marched along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue to honor the civil rights leader.

“We got to continue to do this because not just of Dr King, but of what he stood for,” said Sam Ford, a retired broadcaster and member of the Martin Luther King Jr Day Parade Committee. “The struggle continues.”

Parade participant Harold Hunter echoed that sentiment. “It’s not just a white thing or Black thing. This is a people thing,” he said.

Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy, said elevated fears within racially diverse and immigrant communities meant that King Day observances were forced to take a more urgent tone. “We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” he said.

The Movement for Black Lives said it had planned events in Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland and other cities under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action”.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

At the National Civil Rights museum in Memphis, Tennessee, located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on 4 April 1968, was opened and offering free admission, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” the museum president, Russell Wigginton, told the Associated Press.

But some typical MLK Day events were cancelled, including a dinner at Indiana University in Indianapolis. In a social media post, the school’s Black Student Union said the event was officially cancelled because of “budget constraints”, but the group expressed concern that the cancellation was “connected to broader political pressures”.

A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website. A member of the congregation’s “social justice and peace committee” told the local news site NewsCenterMaine.com that the service was cancelled because agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in the area.

This year’s Dr King celebration comes a year since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term.

Trump’s inauguration ushered in an administration opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, whether in government agencies, schools, universities or cultural institutions.

The justice department’s civil rights division, which under previous administrations has been charged with rooting out discrimination against minority groups, has shifted focus.

In comments to the New York Times this month, Trump said civil rights protections and affirmative action programs had hurt white people. “White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college,” he said.

Meanwhile, the administration has launched aggressive anti-immigration operations in several Democratic-led cities.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, told the Associated Press that the Trump administration’s priorities made clear it is actively trying to erase the movement for social justice.

Citing healthcare access, affordable housing, good-paying jobs and union representation, Wiley said, “things Dr King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture”.

Last month, the National Park Service said it would no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but would instead offer free admission on Flag Day – 14 June. That day is also Trump’s birthday.

At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice. Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Ebenezer’s senior pastor, said the administration was “trying to weaponize despair and convince us that we are at war with one another”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b3c03f813d72e3416f8b7c33bd615ad0ca7fd8/0_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72ef2ffbcef3243e228749ea953b3a28",N,,2026-01-20 11:59:09.291631

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GREENLAND

In a late-night flurry of posts to his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump doubled down on his threats to take Greenland and said he would meet with European leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to talk about the spiraling crisis. He is expected to arrive at the Forum on Wednesday. In one of his posts, he said he’d told NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, “Greenland is imperative for National and World security. There can be no going back.” Trump also posted at 12:58 a.m. an AI-generated image of himself in the Oval Office with European leaders and displaying a map where the United States, Canada, and Greenland are covered in the American flag. The Financial Times reports; Michel Rose and Stine Jacobsen report for Reuters.

During his social media spree, Trump also posted screenshots of private messages he’d received from world leaders over Greenland, including one from French President Emmanuel Macron that read, “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” CNN reports.

Trump also criticized the United Kingdom’s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a deal his administration previously supported, calling it an act of “great stupidity.” He said it was another reason the United States needed to acquire Greenland. Haley Ott for ABC News.

Over the weekend, Trump continued to push for American control of Greenland, risking damaging relations with Europe beyond the point of repair. Following Trump’s threats of economic coercion and military invasion of a NATO ally, “Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered,” Michael D. Shear reports for the New York Times.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that if the United States did not get a deal to buy Greenland, he would first impose a 10 percent tariff “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,” from a certain group of European countries in February. He threatened to raise the rate to 25 percent in June. The threats upended months of trade negotiations between the United States and Europe. Adam Gabbatt, Robert Mackey, and Callum Jones for The Guardian.

In response, European capitals are considering hitting the United States with €93 billion in tariffs. “The retaliation measures are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, officials involved in the preparations said.” Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl report for the Financial Times.

In a text message to Norway’s prime minister Trump said that because he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” and therefore was pursuing the “Complete and Total Control of Greenland” in the interests of the United States. The text was forwarded by the White House to multiple European ambassadors in Washington. Geir Moulson and Jill Lawless report for the Associated Press.

Following a weekend of escalating U.S. threats, Denmark deployed additional troops to Greenland on Monday. Richard Milne, Henry Foy, Barbara Moens, and George Parker report for the Financial Times.

Over the weekend, thousands of people marched in Copenhagen to protest Trump’s escalating threats. “The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted ‘Greenland is not for sale.’ Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump’s own ‘Make America great again’ fashion that read, ‘Make America go away.’” Barbara Sprunt for NPR.

A small European troop deployment to Greenland last week for an Arctic security exercise was viewed by some European officials as having been misread in Washington and as helping spur Trump’s retaliatory rhetoric and tariff threats, the Financial Times reported, citing officials and diplomats. The move was framed as a show of solidarity with Denmark and an “Arctic security” signal, but some diplomats said the messaging was too subtle or too easily misconstrued, while others doubted any reframing would have changed Trump’s response. Charles Clover, Richard Milne, and Amy Kazmin report.

TRUMP’S “BOARD OF PEACE”

When it brokered a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the Trump administration announced that a “Board of Peace” would oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, but it became clear over the weekend that Trump intends it to have a more ambitious mandate, “potentially rivaling the United Nations in what would be a major upheaval to the post-World War II international order,” reports Matthew Lee for the Associated Press.

The Times of Israel published the full text of the board’s charter, which it says “was attached to the invitations sent out to dozens of world leaders who were asked to join Trump on the panel tasked with overseeing the postwar management of Gaza.”

Trump has named himself chair of the international organization and given himself veto power. He has invited world leaders to join the board, telling them if they pay $1 billion, they can secure a permanent seat while those countries that do not pay will have a three-year membership. “On Friday, Trump announced seven members on a founding executive board, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair. Three others include World Bank President Ajay Banga, deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel and billionaire private equity chief Marc Rowan.” Lauren Kaori Gurley and Michael Birnbaum report for the Washington Post.

France rejected Trump’s offer to join the “Board of Peace” and Trump responded on Monday by threatening a 200 percent tariff on French wine. The statement from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said the board’s charter “goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.” Clea Caulcutt for POLITICO.

Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping to join the Board of Peace. “Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.” Ivana Kottasová and Anna Chernova for CNN; Bloomberg reports.

Israel has also been invited, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters, though it was not immediately clear whether Israel has accepted. Reuters reports.

Trump wants to hold a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace this week at Davos, which, along with the crisis over Greenland, is “transforming this week’s annual gathering of the global elite into an emergency diplomatic summit.” Cat Zakrzewski and Emily Davies report for the Washington Post.

MINNESOTA

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilized the state’s National Guard on Saturday to support local law enforcement and emergency agencies as protests continue in Minneapolis over federal immigration enforcement, though troops have not been deployed to city streets and remain “staged and ready to respond.” Guard units have been pictured preparing equipment and are expected to assist with public safety and protection of peaceful assembly should conditions deteriorate. Holly Yan, Hanna Park, Sydney Bishop, Zoe Sottile report for CNN.

Up to 1,500 active-duty U.S. soldiers, primarily from two infantry battalions of the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division, have been placed on prepare-to-deploy orders for a possible mission to Minnesota, the Pentagon confirmed to reporters, though no decision has been made on whether the troops will actually be sent. Konstantin Toropin reports for the Associated Press.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over whether their public statements unlawfully impeded federal immigration enforcement, with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of the probe but not yet received by either office, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials said the investigation is proceeding under a rarely used Civil War–era obstruction statute, based on a theory that state and local leaders conspired to interfere with federal agents. NBC News reported the statute was highlighted in a recent memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that outlined legal tools prosecutors could use to pursue cases against individuals the administration has described as domestic extremists. Ryan J. Reilly and Peter Alexander report for NBC News.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minneapolis ordered ICE agents and other immigration officials to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city. The judge’s order included detailed accounts of how ICE agents are treating people in the city: “A protester detained, her bra removed and wedding ring cut off, and some of her clothes never returned. The ‘gratuitous deployment’ of pepper spray. A couple’s car surrounded by agents, who pointed semiautomatic weapons at them at close range.” Stephanie Saul reports for the New York Times.

On Monday, the Trump administration said it was appealing the judge’s preliminary injunction. Mitch Smith for the New York Times.

The Justice Department is also asking the court to allow its surge of ICE agents in Minnesota to continue after a lawsuit was filed last week by state and local officials claiming that the deployment was unconstitutional. Minnesota had pushed for the federal judge to immediately block the deployment of 3,000 federal agents but she made no rulings last week. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Multiple attorneys say people being detained during ICE operations in Minnesota are being denied the constitutional right to see an attorney by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Four attorneys told ABC News they have been denied access to their clients at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where they are being held,” Matt Rivers, Janice McDonald, and Armando Garcia report.

The FBI determined shortly after Renée Good’s killing that “sufficient grounds existed to open a civil rights probe into the actions of Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good.” The Justice Department says no such investigation exists. Perry Stein reports for the Washington Post.

Protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, MN, on Sunday. Protesters chanted outside a church where one of its pastors appears to also be the acting director of ICE’s field office for enforcement and removal operations in St. Paul, Lauren McCarthy, Maia Coleman, and Emily Cochrane report for the New York Times.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate Sunday’s church protest, officials said. Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon cited violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Andy Rose and Elise Hammond report for CNN.

IRAN

Iran’s judiciary signaled Sunday that some people involved in the recent unrest could still face execution, despite Trump’s suggestion otherwise. Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said certain protest-linked conduct is being treated as “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” an offense that can carry the death penalty, and warned the cases would be “quickly prosecuted and punished.” He also said anyone who “collaborates with the enemy” during unrest would be punished under “clear” legal provisions. Billy Stockwell reports for CNN.

SYRIA

After several days of clashes, Syria’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi agreeing that the SDF would pull back from key Arab-majority areas including Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. The deal also contemplates the SDF’s integration into Syria’s armed forces and the handover to Damascus of oil and gas sites, border crossings, and detention facilities holding Islamic State suspects. The Associated Press reports.

Turkish officials said Monday that the agreement’s terms to cede territory to Damascus could clear Ankara’s main impediment to restarting Turkey’s stalled peace process with the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group. Reuters.

An unknown number of Islamic State (IS) detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison in Syria’s Hasaka region amid renewed fighting around the detention facilities in the northeast and a security breakdown that left control of the site contested, with Damascus and the SDF trading blame over how control was lost. The SDF said the prison—one of three the SDF controls in the Hasakah region—came under repeated assault by “Damascus factions” and that its forces repelled the attackers several times before temporarily losing control, adding that several of its fighters were killed and more than a dozen others wounded. Ghaith Alsayed for the Associated Press.

Syrian authorities said around 120 IS detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison, adding that government forces moved into the area after the breakout and had recaptured 81 during sweep operations, with searches ongoing. Kurdish outlet Rudaw, citing an SDF spokesperson, put the number far higher—around 1,500 escapees. Reuters.

The SDF said it made repeated appeals to a nearby U.S.-led coalition base for assistance during the assault on Shaddadi prison by “Damascus factions,” but that the coalition did not intervene. The SDF added that dozens of its fighters were killed or wounded while defending the facility. Reuters.

U.S. Central Command said a U.S. strike in northwest Syria on Friday killed an Al Qaeda affiliate leader, Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom it described as “an experienced terrorist leader.” CENTCOM said al-Jasim helped plan attacks and was directly linked to the ISIS gunman who carried out the Dec. 13 ambush near Palmyra that killed two U.S. service members and an American interpreter and wounded other U.S. and Syrian personnel. ​​Marlene Lenthang reports for NBC News.

TARIFFS AND OTHER U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

If the Supreme Court rejects the legal foundation for Trump’s tariff program, the administration would move “the next day” to reimpose similar levies under other authorities, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. In a Jan. 15 interview, Greer said the White House has “a lot of different options.” Ana Swanson for the New York Times.

U.S. consumers and importers paid about 96 per cent of the cost of last year’s U.S. tariff increases, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4 per cent through lower prices, new research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy found—cutting against Trump’s repeated claim that foreigners are footing the bill. Using roughly $4 trillion in shipment data from between Jan. 2024 and Nov. 2025, the researchers also found that after surprise tariff hikes on Brazil and India in August 2025, exporters largely did not cut unit prices to offset the tariffs, instead shipping less to the United States, pointing to higher U.S. prices over time and reduced export volumes rather than “foreign-paid” tariffs. Tom Fairless reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The National Guard will remain deployed in Washington, D.C., through 2026. About 2,400 troops are currently stationed in the city and they are mostly from Republican-controlled states. Steven Beynon reports for ABC News.

The three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said Monday that recent U.S. actions on Venezuela, Ukraine, and Greenland raise “basic questions about the use of military force” and have put America’s moral role “under examination.” Michelle Boorstein and Anthony Faiola report for the Washington Post.

Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley emailed immigration judges instructing them that they are not bound by federal court rulings requiring bond-hearing eligibility for many detainees, according to documents the ACLU of Massachusetts filed with a Boston federal court Friday. The ACLU said the directive shows a deliberate effort to disregard those rulings, with a hearing scheduled for today. Reuters reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A D.C. federal judge declined to pause the administration’s new seven-day notice requirement for congressional visits to ICE detention facilities, explaining in a Monday order that the policy constitutes a new agency action not covered by her prior ruling and that the lawmakers raised the challenge through the wrong procedural mechanism. Michael Kunzelman reports for the Associated Press.

According to an international coalition of lawyers’ groups, it is now dangerous to be a lawyer in the United States. “The Day of the Endangered Lawyer, an annual event to raise awareness of risks to members of the profession, has in recent years picked Belarus, Iran and Afghanistan as its subject. For 2026, it has chosen the US.” Kaye Wiggins for the Financial Times.

As the United States reaches the one-year mark in its increasingly dysfunctional and abuse-laden political marriage with Donald J. Trump, though, the President has made it clear that he will take almost any sort of gift—even, and maybe especially, someone else’s Nobel Peace Prize medal. The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado offered hers up to him last week, in a large gold-colored frame, ready for hanging. Although something of a pathetic gesture, given that the Trump Administration seems to have cut a deal with the remnants of Nicolás Maduro’s government (while Maduro himself is in a Brooklyn jail), it did earn her an upgrade. After Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado was “a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect”; post-medal bestowal, she was “a wonderful woman” and her gift “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” Those words might even get her somewhere, if only she had control over a lot of oil reserves. But clocks can make good gifts, too. After a group of Swiss businessmen arrived at the White House in November, bearing a desk clock in the form of an oversized Rolex, the country got a break on tariffs.

Those who aren’t trying to please the President might still keep clocks in mind this January 20th, because the country is in a countdown. Three hundred and sixty-five days of Trump means a thousand and ninety-six to go, including a leap year. (That’s not counting all the Trump first-term days, of course; this is a tragedy of remarriage.) We have aged so much in Trump years that the Biden Administration can feel much longer ago than it was. The brief era of Elon Musk running around the White House may now seem like a fever dream—he and Trump seem to have an off-and-on thing—but hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs in his wake or otherwise had their lives changed irrevocably, including recipients of U.S. aid around the world. On January 1st, millions of Americans lost their health-care subsidies. Immigrants, even legal ones, live with a new level of fear. So, too, do many academics, scientists, and even lawyers. There’s an undercurrent of political violence that wasn’t present in the same way a year ago.

Crucially, there are now only two hundred and eighty-seven days until the midterm elections, which have at least the potential to significantly change the balance of power in Washington. Republicans control both houses of Congress, but the margins are slim: 218–213 in the House of Representatives, giving the G.O.P. a hold so tenuous that the Majority Whip, Tom Emmer, has reportedly indicated that he won’t excuse absences for matters other than “life or death”; the margin in the Senate is 53–47. The entire House is up for reëlection, and it is more than plausible that the Democrats will prevail there; taking the Senate, where thirty-five seats will be contested, will be much tougher, though not impossible. Even before November, there will be special elections for four vacant House seats, including the one held, until recently, by the Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. Her spinning away from the Trump majority—spurred by, of all things, the Jeffery Epstein case—may be an indication that this Administration is decaying more quickly than the calendar alone would indicate.

For at least some other Republicans, at this one-year juncture, the breaking point may be Trump’s uncannily serious talk of buying or seizing Greenland, a territory of our NATO ally Denmark. Some MAGA types love the idea, but, as Politico reported, the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said last week that there was “certainly not an appetite for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.” That statement came before Trump’s announcement, this past Saturday, that he will be imposing tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has raised the possibility of invoking the War Powers Act, a tool that Congress has for reining in the President. Not incidentally, Tillis has said that he will not seek reëlection this year. His seat is open, and one of the top targets for Democrats, who have a strong candidate in former Governor Roy Cooper.

North Carolina matters a great deal, because fewer than a dozen Senate seats are in contention at all, and only a handful are close calls; the others are in states that are solidly red or blue. One is in Minnesota, where Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, has decided not to run again. That race, in that state, is a reminder that, though calendars are crucial, any calculation can be upset in the seconds it takes, for example, for an ICE agent to open fire into an S.U.V. The situation in Minneapolis is precarious, with Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act and put troops on the streets. “If I needed it, I’d use it,” he told reporters on Friday, on his way to Mar-a-Lago. “It’s very powerful.” His Justice Department is reportedly investigating Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz for impeding immigration enforcement, both of whom have described the move as an attempt to intimidate them. (This past year has certainly been very different for Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate, than it would have been.)

Depending on what Trump does next, Minneapolis may become the scene not only of passing chaos but of a breakdown in the relationship between Americans and their government. Precisely because of those stakes, it is worrisome that two of the leading Democratic contenders for Smith’s seat—Representative Angie Craig, who has a reputation as a centrist, and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who is more aligned with the Party’s progressive wing—have been quarrelling, in personal terms, about whose response to the ICE actions and to a social-service-fraud scandal involving the Somali community is better. The intraparty divisions that the two women represent are profound and will play out in primary races at every level. One question is which kind of Democrat has the best chance in November. The answer may differ state to state; one of the more endangered Democratic seats is that of Senator Jon Ossoff, in Georgia.

A judicial clock is running down alongside the electoral one. Trump has issued two hundred and twenty-eight executive orders—eight more than in his entire first term and sixty-six more than Joe Biden did in his four years—along with other dubious actions and pronouncements. These orders have been met by a stream of lawsuits—hundreds of them, by the A.P.’s count—which should keep coming. (Paper is a traditional first-anniversary gift, after all.) The A.P. even brought its own case, Associated Press v. Budowich, after it was barred from the White House press room for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. It’s hard, with Trump, to separate the absurd from the catastrophic. Between now and July, the Supreme Court will hear arguments or issue rulings on a number of the most significant cases occasioned by Trump’s actions, including his attempt to do away with birthright citizenship. On Wednesday, the day after Trump’s Inaugural anniversary, the Court will hear arguments in a case over his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors; Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, recently released a video statement saying that he was being criminally investigated in retaliation for not setting interest rates where the President wanted them.

When Trump was inaugurated, there were fears that he might get three or even four more chances to name a Justice to the Supreme Court. It’s a small blessing that, with a year down, he hasn’t had any yet. Still, one Justice, Clarence Thomas, may be counting days for his own reasons. Thomas is currently the fifth-longest-serving Justice ever, having taken his seat on October 23, 1991. By mid-May, he will have moved up three spots, to be the second-longest-serving. Will that be enough for him to decide to retire while Trump can still appoint his successor? (It would take until April, 2028, for him to pass William O. Douglas for the No. 1 spot. Trump, depending on the makeup of the Senate, may have fewer options to get a nominee confirmed by then.) And Thomas, who is seventy-seven years old, is one of four septuagenarians on the Court. The others are Samuel Alito, seventy-five; Sonia Sotomayor, seventy-one; and John Roberts, seventy.

There are other countdowns. On February 3rd, about three hundred and fifty thousand Haitians are due to lose their Temporary Protected Status, though some may be able to find a different route to stay in the U.S. legally. The Administration has also cancelled, or is trying to cancel, T.P.S. for hundreds of thousands of people from other countries, including Venezuela, Somalia, Nepal, and Nicaragua. There is ongoing litigation, but people with T.P.S., which is meant for migrants from countries in crisis, and a related immigration status, called humanitarian parole, are especially vulnerable, because both Biden and his predecessors relied on the discretion of the executive branch to extend them that relief in the first place. Trump is, in effect, attempting to make use of the same discretion, in reverse, but without regard to the fact that many of these migrants are well settled in their communities, with jobs, neighbors, and children who are citizens, or to the conditions in their home countries. One question is whether he’s done so in an illegitimately arbitrary way, but a majority of the Justices may back him up; they have already stayed certain lower-court attempts to put some of these cancellations on hold. Cruelty, sadly, is not necessarily unconstitutional, at least not in the eyes of the Court.

Indeed, if we’ve learned anything about our constitutional structure in the past year, it’s that the Presidency has, over time, been given too much power. The abdication of the other branches, particularly Congress, to the executive, on matters ranging from military action and surveillance to the economy and immigration, did not begin with Trump. The corollary is that, while Trump can break many things—he can seize a foreign leader, he can scuttle alliances, he can derail lives, and he can make Americans even angrier at one another—whoever comes next will have a lot of power to undo his damage and rebuild. Even he doesn’t have enough control over his party or the courts to keep the next elections from happening, even if having a fair election in every district will require vigilance. (It always does, to some degree.) By that same measure, a President J. D. Vance or Marco Rubio could make the hole we are in much deeper. The Democrats have only so much time to figure out who their own standard-bearer will be. That said, the Party should not move so quickly as to foreclose a truly contested primary, which would have been valuable in 2024.

But that election will be in 2028, and here we are, still in 2026, still with Trump—and still with time to mobilize for the midterms. What Congress has given to Presidents it can also begin to take away. It will take years and a galvanized counter-majority to truly restore the balance, but even just winning one of the chambers back would provide a significant brake on the MAGA vision of executive power. And people at every level, from parents without legal status to the governors of states, can keep bringing the Administration into court. 2026 will be the year for pushing back against Trump with a ballot in one hand and a lawsuit in the other. There is no going back to how things were before January 20, 2025, but there may yet be a better way forward. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/696e90abdc919c8e5d3aa225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Sorkin_SecondFirstYear_AP26012069870543.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:02:52.964286

WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb said she wasn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs’ favor.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Immigration_Enforcement_Minnesota_28866_17980f.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-20 11:59:05.447326

“Today we commemorate of course the legacy of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., a courageous defender of human dignity and civil rights,” Cruikshank said.
""We are calling on institutions and leaders to refuse policies that dehumanize and divide us.” The meeting came as protests continued in Minnesota after an immigration enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen.

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.","A priest, a rabbi, and ministers from a wide range of faith groups walked into Madison Place in Grand Rapids Monday, and called for more humane treatment of immigrants.

“We will not be judged by what we claim that we believe,” said the Rev. Karen Fitz La Barge with the group West Michigan Clergy Action. “We will be judged by what we are willing to risk, by whom we are willing to stand beside.”

The faith leaders gathered on a snowy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, sharing stories of local immigrant families who they say have been detained by federal immigration officials in recent months.

The Rev. Reggie Smith, with the Christian Reformed Church in North America, said his neighbors on the southwest side of Grand Rapids are too afraid to shop at the local grocery store because of reports of arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Something has changed about us,” Smith said. “And maybe on Martin Luther King’s Day — he taught us that we should recognize our own humanity — maybe our immigrant neighbors aren’t the one that need to be saved. Maybe it’s us.”

Father Mike Cruickshank, a catholic priest with Cathedral of Saint Andrew, told the story of a man who he said was arrested at a routine office visit as part of his asylum case. The arrest, Cruickshank said, came as the man’s wife was seven months pregnant. The family has been separated since, according to Cruickshank.

He cited a recent “Special Message” from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on immigration, which noted the government’s role in regulating immigration, but spoke out against conditions in detention centers.

“Today we commemorate of course the legacy of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., a courageous defender of human dignity and civil rights,” Cruikshank said. “And his witness reminds us that silence in the face of injustice is not an option for people of faith.”

Rabbi Javier Cattapan of Temple Emanuel in Grand Rapids, himself an immigrant and naturalized citizen, called for elected officials to do more.

“We are calling for transparency, accountability, and due process,"" Cattapan said. ""We are calling on institutions and leaders to refuse policies that dehumanize and divide us.”

The meeting came as protests continued in Minnesota after an immigration enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen. Grand Rapidians organized protests in the wake of the killing. And since then, rumors of immigration enforcement actions have swirled on social media in West Michigan.

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.

“It’s not as if I’m getting a daily report from ICE on what they’re doing anywhere,” LaGrand said. “Last week, I spent a chunk of my morning simply driving around a part of our town where I’d heard that ICE was out doing door-to-door encounters. And I didn’t see anything.” The mayor said he’s not sure which online reports are true, and which are not.

“We’re sort of operating in the dark,” LaGrand said. “We’re at a point where I think everyone has to be vigilant, but we don’t want to overreact.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/714cf24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fd2%2F4cac221a4af0b554a1db1850f2ee%2Fimg-8719.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 08:00:32.803909

In Minnesota, residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain on edge, as clashes between protesters and federal immigration officers continue into a third week.

It comes as the Department of Justice announced its plan to pursue charges against protesters in Minneapolis, while confirming it does not plan to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro has the latest.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Another weekend and another intense wave of immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities, as more than 2,000 federal officers continue a crackdown characterized by aggressive force and unyielding protests.

It comes as weary residents brace for the potential deployment of active duty troops after President Trump threatened late last week to invoke the Insurrection Act, something Mayor Jacob Frey said Sunday would be -- quote -- ""shocking.

Jacob Frey:

You got to understand how wild this is right now. In Minneapolis, crime is dramatically down. We don't need more federal agents to keep people safe. We are safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Frey himself, along with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are now reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding federal law enforcement officers.

Yesterday, the Justice Department announced a separate investigation into protesters who disrupted a church service where they believed a local pastor was also an ICE official from the St. Paul office. That same day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche again confirmed there would be no investigation into the altercation that has most roiled the city, the fatal shooting of Renee Good, killed by an ICE agent in her car on January 7.

Todd Blanche, U.S. Deputy Attorney General:

We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. And that is not the case here, it wasn't the case when it happened and it's not the case today.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

The Department of Homeland Security said its agents are facing -- quote -- ""rampant violence"" and have made 3,000 arrests in the last six weeks. The ""News Hour"" could not independently verify that number.

It all comes after a federal judge in Minnesota ruled agents could not arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring ICE operations.

Kristi Noem, DHS secretary, said on CBS' Face the Nation yesterday that the judge's ruling -- quote -- ""didn't change anything.""

Kristi Noem, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary:

That federal order was a little ridiculous, because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing.

We -- we are -- have not engaged in...

Margaret Brennan, Host, ""Face the Nation"": Well, we just saw video of chemical agents being used.

Kristi Noem:

... any -- we only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Nonetheless, the Justice Department said today it would appeal the court ruling. This weekend, a planned anti-Islam pro-ICE rally, which was set to feature a Koran burning, drew few supporters.

But its organizer, far right activist Jake Lang, had to be escorted from the scene, ironically by counterprotesters themselves, after he was swarmed and pelted with water balloons. Lang could be seen bleeding from his head and later claimed he had been stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report had been filed.

Even for Minnesota, weather here in recent days has been unusually cold, about the only indication that temperatures are turning down here.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

3rd detainee dies at Camp East Montana

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

Report: Death at Camp East Montana could be ruled a homicide

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

Camp East Montana detainee dies from ‘suspected natural causes’

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

Texas Immigration Law Council.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

Human rights groups detail abuse at Fort Bliss migrant camp, call for its closure

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”

“Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.”

Officials in Minnesota filed the lawsuit last week in an effort to curb the administration’s ongoing crackdown in their state, equating the surge of federal immigration agents to the state to “a federal invasion” and citing violations of the 10th Amendment. The suit was filed shortly after Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security has terrorized residents in “organized bombardment.”

Reiner, a CNN medical analyst, cited Trump’s recent letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, in which he appeared to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his having not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

“This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness,” Reiner wrote on the social platform X.

Trump’s message, which was shared with multiple European ambassadors, questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over Greenland, a semiautonomous Arctic territory rich in minerals and seen as key to security in the region.

“They just took me out there with no clothes on and then just covered with my grandson’s blanket. Yeah, they just took me out there, and I was like, ‘Man, this is, this is embarrassing,” Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, said from the home Monday while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Videos of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket spread on social media, further fueling public outrage from some about the tactics being used in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the Minneapolis area, where 3,000 agents have been deployed.

Louansee Moua, Thao’s sister-in-law, said it was frigid and snowing when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers took him from the house. “It was so heartbreaking seeing him in that image,” Moua said. “You can’t get it out of your head. He has no clothes, and it’s, like, 12 degrees and it’s snowing.”

Moua said her brother-in-law went willingly with the officers without knowing why he was being detained. “He went willingly because he was afraid,” she said, adding that Thao’s demeanor is very generous and laid-back.

The Department of Homeland Security said that officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

“He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

In a statement Monday, Thao's family said the agency's account did not reflect their firsthand knowledge of the events or the living situation at the residence.

""The only individuals residing at the home are Mr. Thao, his adult son, his daughter-in-law, and his young grandson. The family does not know the individuals referenced in DHS’s statement,"" the family said.

Thao's family said officials did not present a warrant or request ID before he was detained.

""Mr. Thao did not resist and went with agents voluntarily, despite the absence of an explanation for his detention at the time,"" the family said in its statement.

A U.S. district Judge in Minnesota issued an injunction Friday blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would “chill” an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest. The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said that his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was 4 and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During Sunday’s ordeal, he said, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his 4-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After they took his fingerprints and a photograph of him in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

Chris Thao, his son, said: “We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have to have a safe place to live. If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-Chongly-Scott-Thao-rs-dbeefb.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 04:58:52.162537

Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.
Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops.
Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA.
“Accordingly, “IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.","Where petitioners have requested habeas corpus relief, their petition should be granted because the respondents have violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the petitioners bond hearings.

“Petitioners, although having no lawful immigration status, have resided in the United States for at least a decade, and for many of them, several decades. …

“Between August 9 and November 4, 2025, Petitioners were taken into immigration custody following routine traffic stops or targeted investigations. They have been detained ever since without a bond hearing pending removal proceedings. Petitioners are held at different facilities throughout Michigan. Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.

“On November 10, 2025, Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2241, claiming that their detention without a bond hearing violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (‘INA’) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. …

“The key issue here is which provision of the INA applies to the detention of individuals like Petitioners—i.e., non-U.S. citizens facing removal proceedings who were not taken into custody at the border or a port of entry but after living in the United States for some period of time. The choice is between the discretionary detention framework of §1226(a), as Petitioners argue, or the mandatory detention requirement in §1225(b)(2), as Respondents argue. …

“Numerous courts throughout the country have been presented with the issue since July of this year, when ICE issued its mandatory-detention directive, thereby departing from the government’s longstanding interpretation of the INA as providing for the discretionary detention of individuals like Petitioners. An overwhelming majority of those courts have concluded that §1226(a) is the appropriate statutory framework. … This Court is persuaded by these decisions. …

“According to the plain language of the statute, §1225(b)(2)(A) applies only when an alien is ‘seeking admission’ and the ‘examining immigration officer’ concludes that the alien ‘is not clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted.’ Petitioners were not in the process of seeking admission when they encountered federal officials who deemed them not entitled to be admitted. They were going about their everyday lives when they were stopped, arrested, and placed in ICE custody. The plain language of §1226, including the title of this section and its subsections, apply to their situation. …

“In short, §1226 provides the general rule for detention of noncitizens, while §1225 specifically covers noncitizens detained at a border or port of entry. Petitioners were not apprehended upon their arrival to the United States at a border or port of entry. Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops. Section 1226, therefore, governs their detention and each of them are entitled to a bond hearing under the statute’s discretionary framework. …

“The Court concludes that, with the exception of EOIR, the named individuals and agencies are proper Respondents in this case. The Court further concludes that Petitioners need not exhaust their administrative remedies to proceed with their request for habeas relief under §2241. Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA. The Court therefore finds it unnecessary to address Petitioners’ due process claim at this time.

“Accordingly,

“IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.

“IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each Petitioner shall be afforded a bond hearing under §1226(a) before an immigration judge on or before 5:00 p.m. on December 10, 2025, or be released.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2026-01-20 05:57:38.398384

DOJ says Minnesota wants a ‘state veto’

What they're saying:

Federal attorneys argue that Minnesota is ""effectively seeking a state veto over the enforcement of federal law"" which the DOJ refers to as an ""absurdity.""

In its complaint, the state argued that the federal operation has created uncertainty and danger. Federal officials say Minnesota's ""sanctuary"" policies have ""exacerbated dangers"" posed by undocumented immigrants in the Twin Cities.

The DOJ also claims it's their own federal offices who are facing danger as assaults against federal officers have increased in recent months.

""Federal officers and agents face violent attacks at federal buildings, at immigration processing facilities, and while in the field conducting enforcement operations,"" the DOJ's response states. ""Foreign criminal organizations have offered thousands of dollars as bounties for the murder of federal immigration enforcement officers and agents. Because federal immigration officers and agents have faced doxing, including revelation of their home addresses, these threats extend to their families.""

The DOJ adds: ""In and around Minneapolis, ICE officers operating out of the St. Paul Office have been confronted with increased threats, violence, aggression, attacks, vehicle block-ins, and obstruction of immigration enforcement operations. The increase in these types of incidents has obstructed enforcement operations, interfered with officers’ official duties, and posed significant safety risks to not only ICE officers but also the public. These incidents have further increased since Operation Metro Surge launched in early December 2025.""

Dig deeper:

Federal attorneys also say the state's legal basis is flawed, claiming Minnesota's view of the Tenth Amendment is not how the law has been applied.

""The Tenth Amendment does not give a state or a city a veto power over those federal activities,"" the DOJ writes, citing a 2023 case. ""Rather, ‘in our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.’""

The DOJ also argues its operation hasn't infringed on Minnesota's core policing powers nor has it violated Minnesota's sovereignty.

Minnesota brings lawsuit against feds over ICE surge

The backstory:

Last week, the State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul announced a lawsuit against federal authorities aiming to end the ICE surge in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. At a court hearing last Wednesday, a judge denied the state's request to force an immediate end to the ICE operation but kept the lawsuit on the fast track.

What's next:

The judge ordered the DOJ to file its response to the temporary restraining order by Monday.

The state now has until Thursday to respond to these arguments.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1200/630/ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:01.023999

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

Texas Immigration Law Council.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

Video captured ICE officers armed with assault rifles pushing through the private home on Nevada Avenue in St. Paul last Thursday, Jan. 15.

A neighbor told FOX 9 that family members told the agents had a warrant for the raid but never presented the documentation.

In the aftermath of the raid, loved ones filed a habeas petition in U.S. District Court, demanding the release of all six extended family members, including a 12-year-old boy.

In response to the habeas filing, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim issued an order directing DHS to respond and produce a judicial warrant by 5 p.m. on Monday.

The court said that in the absence of a warrant, their release would be granted.

Once the deadline passed, Tunheim ruled that DHS and its attorneys failed to respond, and the court granted the habeas corpus petition. He gave the department 72 hours to release all six of the detainees, who are believed to have been transferred out of Minnesota following their arrest.

Tunheim’s order states, they must be ""immediately returned,"" prior to being set free.

Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation.","SALT LAKE CITY — Immigration is a big focus of attention across the nation, and several proposals have emerged or are in the works for consideration when Utah's 2026 legislative session starts next week.

Most notably, Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, has put forward a proposal that would prevent immigrants in the country illegally from being able to tap into public benefits. The measure, HB88, would potentially make immunizations by public health officials, food at food banks and housing at homeless shelters off limits to the population. ""Benefits and welfare should go to citizens only,"" said Lee, an ardent critic of illegal immigration who also worries about the impact on U.S. culture of other classes of immigrants.

He's also considering legislation to eliminate the state program that lets Utah immigrants who are in the country illegally get driver privilege cards, which allow them to lawfully drive in the state. Another possibility, also in the works, would prohibit landlords and home sellers from renting or selling homes to those in the country illegally.

Other proposals from other lawmakers are in the works as well, including a measure put forward by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, that would add a 2% tax to international remittances by immigrants in the country illegally. Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, is proposing a measure to beef up the rules meant to prevent immigrants from voting in elections. Rep. Matt MacPerson, R-West Valley City, proposes new rules targeting those who drive without a license, which includes immigrants, among others.

Last year was a big year for legislation focused on immigration and immigrants in the country illegally, and it appears the issue is returning for 2026. With the new session starting next Tuesday, Jan. 20, here's a look at some of the measures in the works:

HB88: The measure is modeled after a bill passed by Idaho lawmakers last year, HB135, which, as Lee puts it, ""takes all benefits from illegal immigrants.""

It would require proof of legal residency in the country to access testing at public health facilities for communicable diseases and immunizations. It would also require similar proof for those seeking help at food banks, crisis counseling and lodging at homeless shelters, presumably if the services are provided by state entities.

A critic of the measure, Ciriac Alvarez, senior policy analyst at Voices for Utah Children, said it's not crystal clear exactly how far-reaching HB88 would be. Her group advocates for Utah children, including immigrant children.

Alvarez worries that food banks and homeless shelters that receive state funds could fall under its umbrella and fears its impact on the estimated 100,000 immigrants in the country illegally in Utah and their 59,000 U.S.-born kids. She also wonders whether it would apply to other classes of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and immigrants in the country under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

HB135, the Idaho measure used as a model for HB88, faces a legal challenge and, in the meantime, hasn't gone into effect, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Lee hasn't yet put forward a specific proposal to end access to driving privilege cards. But he's a critic and says he's working on it.

Access to such identification helps immigrants in the country illegally stay and work here, undermining federal laws, Lee said. ""It straight-up rewards breaking the law and costs taxpayers. Utah's one of the only red states doing this — totally clashes with our values. Repeal time!"" he said in an email.

Alvarez said the program also benefits other classes of immigrants, including those with legal parole in the United States. If it's eliminated, she warns that some will still drive.

Lee's idea of a bill to prohibit renting or selling of homes to immigrants in the country illegally is modeled after a measure passed by lawmakers in Tennessee last year, SB392, he said. That measure also faces a legal challenge.

HB141: The measure would require proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency to send money abroad. Lacking such identification, entities wiring the funds would be required to impose a 2% tax on the amount to be sent, money that would go into Utah's general fund.

The tax would potentially apply to the money that immigrants in the United States illegally send to family back in their home countries, known as international remittances. A provision in the bill allows those who have to pay the tax to get a credit for the amount when filing their income taxes.

Gricius, who didn't respond to a query seeking comment, pursued similar legislation last year, HB284, but it stalled as the session came to an end. Remittances by immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, among other countries, are a significant source of income for family and other recipients in their home countries.

HB209: The bill calls for increased steps when people are registering to vote to make sure they are U.S. citizens, not immigrants, who aren't allowed to vote in U.S. elections, whether here legally or illegally.

""As for noncitizens voting, Utah law already makes it illegal. This bill is about tightening safeguards and public confidence, not responding to widespread fraud,"" said Maloy, sponsor of the measure. ""Even rare or inadvertent registrations undermine trust in elections.""

The measure requires presentation of proof of U.S. citizenship when applying to register to vote. Utah's REAL ID state-issued driver's licenses specify whether holders are U.S. citizens or immigrants and could be used to demonstrate citizenship. Voters without Utah REAL ID identity cards, which feature a gold star, ""will have to provide proof of citizenship to the county clerks,"" Maloy said.

The measure also contains a provision allowing for ""targeted review"" of registered voters suspected of not being U.S. citizens.

Utah Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation. She cited at least two reports of noncitizens successfully registering to vote or actually voting in Utah. Maloy ended up as sponsor of the proposal.

HB136: The measure doesn't specifically single out immigrants but allows for seizure of cars operated by people without driver's licenses or driver privilege cards, which includes immigrants, among others.

MacPherson, the bill sponsor, noted 11 fatalities last year on Utah highways involving unlicensed drivers. Moreover, upward of 40% of ""vehicle interactions"" in West Valley City, where he lives, involve unlicensed drivers, he said. The pool of people without licenses includes kids, ""sovereign-citizen types"" and some immigrants, even though they are able to get driver privilege cards if not driver's licenses.

On encountering unlicensed drivers, police are ""stuck without tools to deal with it,"" MacPherson said. ""The best tool is to impound the vehicle. We already impound for DUI, reckless driving, expired registration and a host of other reasons. This gives this tool to law enforcement for this offense as well.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3140/314053/31405347.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2026-01-19 23:57:50.683576

ChongLy Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen who goes by the name Scott, was returned home later on Sunday without explanation or apology, he said.

""I was praying. I was like, God, please help me, I didn't do anything wrong. Why do they do this to me? Without my clothes on,"" Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, told Reuters from his home on Monday, while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Pictures of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket taken by a Reuters photographer and bystanders spread on social media, further fueling concern that federal law enforcement officers were exceeding their authority as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen some 3,000 officers deployed in the Minneapolis area.

A statement published by the family called the incident ""unnecessary, degrading, and deeply traumatizing."" The highest temperature in Saint Paul on Sunday was 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius).

The Department of Homeland Security said officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

""He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

'WHY ARE WE HERE'

DHS published wanted posters for two men targeted in the investigation who were still at large, describing each as a ""criminal illegal alien"" from Laos who is subject to deportation orders. One of the men in the wanted posters previously lived at the house but moved out, according to relatives close to the situation, who described him as the ex-husband of a member of the Thao family.

A U.S. District Judge in Minnesota on Friday issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would ""chill"" an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest.

""That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics,"" Judge Katherine Menendez wrote.

The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was four-years-old and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During the ordeal, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said that he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his four-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After taking his fingerprints and a head shot in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

""We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have a safe place to live,"" he said. ""If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?""

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""
""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.","WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ""will pursue charges"" related to a protest in a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said Monday, specifically calling out ex-CNN journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of the event.

In an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said journalism is not a ""shield"" from a ""criminal conspiracy.""

""Don Lemon himself has come out and said he knew exactly what was going to happen inside that facility,"" Dhillon said on “The Benny Show.” ""He went into the facility, and then he began — quote, unquote — 'committing journalism,' as if that’s sort of a shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy. It isn’t.""

Dhillon did not confirm whether the Justice Department would pursue charges against Lemon in particular. NBC News has asked the Justice Department and the place of worship, Cities Church, for comment.

Reached for a response to Dhillon's remarks, Lemon said in an email that ""it’s notable that I’ve been cast as the face of a protest I was covering as a journalist — especially since I wasn’t the only reporter there.""

""That framing is telling,"" he said. ""What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs, directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press.""

Lemon said he stood by his reporting.

""If this much time and energy is going to be spent manufacturing outrage, it would be far better used investigating the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good — the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer this month.

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""

""Come next Sunday, nobody should think in the United States that they're going to be able to get away with this,"" she said. ""Everyone in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening and put people away for a long, long time.""

In a video posted on his digital talk show’s YouTube channel, Lemon stands outside with protesters while he explains that he is at an “operation that is a secret.”

Speaking to Lemon, one of the protesters, Nekima Levy Armstrong, refers to the protest as “Operation Pull Up."" She says the protesters are “demanding justice for Renee Good and letting them know that this will not stand.”

In a later clip of the protest inside the church, Lemon says, “We’re not part of the activists, but we’re here just reporting on them.”

Lemon reported that activists had gone to the church because, they alleged, one of its officials worked at the local ICE field office. NBC News has not verified a connection.

Dhillon said Sunday afternoon on X that the Justice Department was ""investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers,"" referring to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The law, enacted in 1994, prohibits interfering with or obstructing people from seeking reproductive health services or exercising religious freedom at places of worship.

In her interview with Johnson, Dhillon also mentioned the possibility of invoking the Enforcement Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was passed during Reconstruction to protect Black Americans' civil rights.

""Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,"" she said.

Protesters can face restrictions on private property without the consent of the property owner.

A livestream posted on the Black Lives Matter Minnesota Facebook page showed protesters at the church Sunday chanting “ICE out” and “Renee Good.”

During the protest, Lemon reported from inside the church, interviewing a pastor who asked him to leave the building unless he was there to worship.

""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.

Tensions and anti-ICE protests have grown in the aftermath of Good's killing in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. The administration has sided with Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot her, arguing that he acted in self-defense. Protesters and Minnesota officials have slammed ICE, calling on the administration to remove its personnel.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests, which Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said would be ""a shocking step.""

""In Minneapolis, we’re not going to be intimidated,"" Frey said in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""We’re not backing down.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260119-Don-Lemon-Harmeet-Dhillon-rs-79c13a.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 23:58:05.151035

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts.
It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility.
Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.","Central Florida officials and immigrant advocates on Monday criticized a possible new ICE detention facility here as the region sees a surge in undocumented immigrants arrests.

At a press conference at Hope CommUnity Center in Apopka, Executive Director Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet and Central Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost joined others condemning the potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at a warehouse in east Orlando.

“The people of Orange County, of Orlando and of Florida’s 10th congressional district do not want, and we reject, an ICE detention facility,” Frost said.

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts. The facility may be part of a national plan, first reported last month by The Washington Post, to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country.

“Let’s be clear about what’s going on across the nation,” Frost said. “They’re shopping around warehouses. This is one of many they’re looking at opening.”

As of Monday morning, roughly 183 people were detained in the Orange County Jail on an ICE hold without any local charges, but that number is likely higher when those held on minor criminal violations like traffic stops are accounted for, Rep. Anna Eskamani said.

“It’s very high,” Eskamani said of the number of people arrested. “When I visited the jail a few months ago it was at most 40 people under just ICE holds, so that’s substantially more.”

The surge in local arrests comes amid the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Minneapolis to quell immigration protests there after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in a vehicle. Those at Monday’s news conference warned that Orlando could be the Trump administration’s next target in its immigration crackdown.

“We are seeing exactly what we have seen across the country,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “We have heard from U.S. citizens that have been followed for several miles on the highway.”

Sousa-Lazaballet said ICE operations have increased locally and his organization is receiving roughly 60 calls per day, up from five, from family members of those arrested.

On Friday, Hope CommUnity Center said in a statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours. A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total because about 300 people had been booked in December.

WKMG and WFTV reported that ICE representatives toured a 439,000-square-foot east Orlando warehouse on Friday. It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility. The Orlando City Council may have to approve such a change, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.

“This is a logistical issue as much as it’s a humanitarian issue,” Wilson said. “If local government based on the Florida constitution is where we look at that permitting, we look at that use and the underlying land use, and we scrutinize this.”

State Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis called everyone to peacefully protest ICE and said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a day to remember what he stood for.

“If you are safe, you should be standing with those who are not,” Bracy Davis said. “Dr. King reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice, but it bends faster when the dissatisfied pick it up, put it to work.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOS-L-ICE-presser-01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2026-01-19 19:57:53.337006

Victor Manuel Diaz dies in ICE custody

The backstory:

ICE says contract security staff found Victor Manuel Diaz unconscious in his room at Camp East Montana. Medical staff on site were immediately notified and began life-saving measures. El Paso EMS was called at 3:35 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes later to continue efforts. Diaz was pronounced dead at 4:09 p.m. on Jan. 14.

Diaz had been in ICE custody since Jan. 6 after being arrested in Minneapolis for an immigration violation. He had entered the United States illegally on March 26, 2024, and was ordered removed in absentia by an immigration judge in August if 2025.

Cause of death under investigation

What we know:

ICE says Diaz's death is presumed to be a suicide, though the official cause is still being investigated.

ICE has protocols in place to report in-custody deaths, which include notifying Congress, stakeholders and the media. Reports are also made available on ICE's public website within 90 days. Federal officials released the following statement:

""ICE emphasizes that all detainees receive comprehensive medical care, including screenings and access to emergency services. They assert that no detained individual is denied emergency care during their stay.""

Tina Smith, Jason Chavez react

What they're saying:

U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Jason Chavez of the Minneapolis City Council issued statements on the man's death via social media.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.

The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.

Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody this year.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.

His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.

Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him, told the Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.

“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.

After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’s initial statement.

Another Camp East Montana inmate, Francisco Gaspar-Andres, died at a nearby hospital on 3 December. He was 48.

That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing.","Lawyers for the Trump administration said on Monday that they were appealing a judge’s injunction that imposed limits on immigration agents’ interactions with protesters in Minnesota.

In a short notice filed on Monday with the judge who issued the preliminary injunction last week, Justice Department lawyers said they would challenge those limits at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The lawsuit that led to the injunction claimed that federal law enforcement officers had repeatedly violated the rights of protesters who observed or recorded immigration enforcement actions or voiced opposition to those actions.

In her injunction, handed down on Friday, Judge Kate M. Menendez of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not give the plaintiffs everything they had sought in the injunction. She did not include specific protection for the recording of agents, nor did she impose rules about how agents issue dispersal orders.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the appeal. Though a notice of appeal was filed with the district court, the full text of the appeal was not immediately available from the Eighth Circuit.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on Friday in a statement responding to Judge Menendez’s injunction that “D.H.S. is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

She added that despite “grave threats,” agents had “followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public and federal property.”

A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, which backed the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appeal.

The lawsuit described a “federal campaign to besiege cities across the United States in an unprecedented attack on civil liberties,” and described the case as an effort “to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document, and criticize defendants’ activities, safely and unburdened by the fear of retaliation.”

The suit is one of several filed in recent weeks related to the surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota. The enforcement campaign has led to at least 2,400 arrests, as well as repeated clashes with protesters and two shootings, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. In another incident in Minneapolis last week, a federal agent shot and injured a man who officials said was in the country illegally and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or broom.

Judge Menendez is weighing a separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing. The state asked Judge Menendez to issue an immediate ruling in that case, but she declined last week to do so.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:57:55.073250

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term.
Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.
The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook.
In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered.","The Supreme Court’s review this week of President Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve was always going to pose a key test of how much leeway the justices would give the president to remake and control the central bank.

Then the Justice Department issued subpoenas this month as part of a criminal investigation into the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.

Legal experts said that development threatened to complicate the Trump administration’s case, making a potentially difficult-to-win case even more challenging.

Mr. Trump’s solicitor general will argue to the court on Wednesday that the president had a valid reason to fire Lisa Cook, who has been a Fed governor since 2022, because she allegedly engaged in mortgage fraud. She sued after Mr. Trump tried to oust her in August, arguing that the law that established the Fed allowed presidents to dismiss members only “for cause.”

Ms. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, denies the allegations, which relate to loan documents she signed before joining the Fed.

Analysts say the Powell subpoenas could bolster the sense that the Trump administration ginned up a pretext to oust Ms. Cook as a way to force the central bank to lower borrowing costs.

The move against Mr. Powell “undermines the administration’s contention that this is all about Lisa Cook’s conduct and not about her votes on monetary policy,” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor who is closely tracking the case.

“It all tends to suggest that the goal here is to take over the Fed,” he said.

Mr. Powell will attend Wednesday’s arguments, along with Ms. Cook, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Central bank governors serve staggered 14-year terms “unless sooner removed for cause by the president,” according to federal law. Congress put those protections in place in 1913 and renewed them in 1935 to ensure the independence of the institution and allow officials to set monetary policy without political interference from the president.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Powell misled Congress when questioned in June about extensive renovations of the Fed’s headquarters in Washington that are running hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.

Mr. Powell has aggressively pushed back, saying the investigation is a “consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

That is the same argument Ms. Cook’s lawyers will make during Wednesday’s argument. In filings, they have said the mortgage fraud allegation is “paper-thin, unproven” and a “manufactured” pretext for policy disagreements.

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term. Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.

Despite his complaints about Mr. Powell, the president moved to fire Ms. Cook, a nominee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., citing the allegations that she falsified bank documents to acquire more favorable loan terms.

Former top Fed and Treasury officials and Ms. Cook’s legal team have warned the Supreme Court that permitting Mr. Trump to fire her while her litigation is underway would spur economic turmoil and undermine public confidence in the central bank.

The Justice Department argues that Mr. Trump has cited a “cause” to fire Ms. Cook, and that the court cannot second-guess the specific reason the president has identified.

How much discretion presidents have to remove Fed officials, what counts as cause, and whether officials are entitled to notice and process before being ousted will be key questions for the justices at Wednesday’s argument.

The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook. That distinguishes the case from one the Supreme Court heard in December, in which the administration argued that laws requiring the president to identify a rationale before firing other independent regulators infringed on the president’s constitutional authority.

The Supreme Court has been overwhelmingly receptive to Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove regulators from other independent agencies. But the justices have repeatedly signaled that they view the Fed differently.

In cases involving the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the justices allowed Mr. Trump to fire officials while their litigation was underway, despite congressionally imposed limits on the president’s removal power.

In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered. The justices also went out of their way to suggest that the Fed may stand apart from other agencies, writing in an order in May that it is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a distinct history.

The newly revealed subpoenas and investigation into Mr. Powell are not officially part of the record before the Supreme Court in Ms. Cook’s case, but experts said atmospherics can matter.

In April 2004, photographs showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib were published the same day the court heard a challenge to the Bush administration’s detention of “enemy combatants” at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The court ultimately ruled against the administration, saying those deemed enemy combatants must be able to challenge their detention before a judge or other “neutral decision maker.”

“That’s not what you want the justices reading about the morning of your argument,” Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William and Mary, said of the government’s lawyers in that case. “You want to be right on the law, but it certainly helps to have atmospherics on your side.”

Those atmospherics could play a role as the justices decide how much flexibility Mr. Trump has to get rid of Ms. Cook before her term expires.

Jennifer Nou, a University of Chicago law professor, said the court ordinarily gave broad discretion to such executive branch judgments. But she pointed to a case during Mr. Trump’s first term that showed that the justices would sometimes reject what they viewed as a made-up rationale by the president or his top advisers.

In 2019, the court rejected the administration’s justification for adding a question about citizenship status to the census. The court said the commerce secretary had not been upfront when he told Congress he acted “solely” in response to a Justice Department request. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the explanation “appears to have been contrived” and that the secretary “was determined” to add the question.

The census decision “can be broadly understood to stand for the proposition that the court does not take pretext lightly,” Ms. Nou said, and “can’t be blinded to the real world.”

The revelations about the U.S. attorney’s investigation into whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress could bolster Ms. Cook’s argument, experts said.",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:58:04.149920

I am writing to express my concern over the recent resolution to discuss the possibility of the County Sheriff’s department cooperating with ICE by way of a 287(g) agreement. We are seeing a lot of opposition to ICE’s presence in our country. If ICE were pursuing and arresting immigrants with violent criminal records or proven gang affiliation, as was promised by the President, I don’t believe there would be such widespread opposition.

The fact that there is a quota set, and that people who have lived and worked here for years are being targeted, is the reason that citizens are forming groups to watch and even interfere with ICE agents performing their duties.

There is room for a debate over whether we should be deporting people who have no criminal record, but also no legal status. I think almost everyone agrees that our immigration system is badly in need of repair. However, my objection to ICE has much more to do with their tactics. They are masked and without visible ID in many if not all cases—as far as I know that is unacceptable for any law enforcement officer.

I assume that our county deputies will not be masked and will continue to have visible ID, but I’m trying to make a point here about the public sentiment ICE has generated. Their agents are being sent into selected cities in great numbers, outfitted with military gear and weaponry, and are generating an atmosphere, not of safety, but of fear. Incidents like the tragic death in Minneapolis and in other places are bound to happen, as citizens resist these tactics. They are provoking, not protecting.

There is currently a case pending in a state appellate court in Nassau County where the plaintiff is arguing that NY law prevents the police from arresting or detaining people for civil violations of federal immigration law. This is exactly the agreement that is being considered, the 287(g) agreement. My feeling is that the legislature should at the very least wait until this case is decided by the courts. Why put our county in jeopardy of lawsuits unnecessarily, or create the kind of division and anger we see elsewhere in our country?

I think most folks in St Lawrence County appreciate and respect the Sheriff’s department and think of its deputies as neighbors. This kind of cooperation with ICE will only be detrimental to that feeling.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear SEC vs. Sripetch, et al., a Ninth Circuit decision affirming a disgorgement award despite the SEC’s failure to demonstrate defrauded investors suffered pecuniary harm.1

The Supreme Court limited the SEC’s ability to claim disgorgement in the 2020 decision in Liu v. SEC, finding that disgorgement can be equitable relief if it is confined to the wrongdoer’s illicit net profits and is returned to victims.2 Following Liu, Courts split on pecuniary harm was needed to support a disgorgement award.3 For example, in SEC v. Govil, the Second Circuit concluded a showing of pecuniary harm was required given disgorgement’s equitable limitation that it be “awarded for victims.”4 In reaching the exact opposite conclusion, the First Circuit in SEC v. Navellier & Associates, Inc. held that disgorgement does not require a showing of pecuniary harm so long as disgorgement was “tethered to a wrongdoer’s net unlawful profits.”5 If that threshold is met, courts need not be concerned with a victim’s harm.6

The Court’s resolution in this matter will have wide implications for SEC enforcement, specifically the monetary penalties the SEC may seek both in negotiations and in litigation. If the Court finds pecuniary harm is required, it will further restrict the SEC’s powers.

Stacie Halpern, an attorney representing Palacios, told Eyewitness News that the allegations made against her client were investigated by law enforcement and the Department of Children and Family Services and said ""they were unable to find anything that corroborated the allegations and deemed them unfounded.""

She said Palacios acted in self-defense the night Porter was killed and said he was protecting the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has also not confirmed whether Palacios was involved in the shooting.

Porter was fatally shot the night of Dec. 31 in the 17700 block of Roscoe Boulevard.

According to a statement from DHS, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment.

""The suspected gunfire grew progressively louder, indicating to the officer that whoever was firing a gun was approaching his apartment,"" read a statement released by Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. ""The officer took his ICE authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate. He moved to the ground level and went outside, where he believed the suspected gunfire was coming from.""

DHS said the agent encountered Porter holding what appeared to be a long rifle and ordered him to put it down.

""The ICE officer identified himself as law enforcement,"" read the DHS statement. ""In response, the individual pointed his weapon at the ICE officer. The officer ordered the subject to put the weapon down. When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer.""

Porter's family, however, disputes that account, saying his gunfire was part of a New Year's celebration. They are asking for more information as they mourn his death.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18432363_011826-kabc-7a-DHS-northridge-shooting-STRINGER-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:03.228948

Justice department officials accuse the protesters of ""desecrating a house of worship"", and say they will investigate them for civil rights violations.

Anti-ICE protests continue in the state against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and the Pentagon reportedly placed 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible deployment.

On Sunday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to exercise the ""full force of federal law"" against the demonstrators who interrupted the service at the Cities Church in St Paul, which neighbors Minneapolis.

Later on Monday, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said on X that the justice department ""will pursue federal charges in this case"".

Protesters say that one of the church's eight pastors, David Easterwood, is a local ICE official.

Easterwood was not leading the service on Sunday.

A person by the same name is identified in ACLU court filings as the acting director of the ICE St Paul field office, according to reporting by the Associated Press and the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

The AP also reported he appeared alongside Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in Minneapolis at a news conference last October.

The BBC has contacted the church for comment.

In a statement, DHS said it does not confirm or deny the identities of its agents as ""publicizing their identities puts their lives and the lives of their families at serious risk"".

Monique Cullars-Doty, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota and one of the protest organisers, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that ""we can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray"".

Elsewhere in the city, protests with occasional clashes have persisted at the Whipple building in Minneapolis where federal agents are headquartered.

A DHS spokesperson said on Monday that at least 3,000 people have been arrested in Minneapolis since the deployments.

On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.

Thousands of ICE agents are in Minnesota as part of a surge by the Trump administration after his election pledge for the biggest deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history.

On Sunday, CBS News reported that 1,500 active-duty soldiers have been placed on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, after President Trump said he may invoke the Insurrection Act to respond to protests.

The 19th-Century law allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.

Dozens of people rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul Sunday morning, interrupting the church service and leading to tense confrontations, videos posted by activists and content creators show.

“ICE out!” protesters shouted as they were confronted by the lead pastor and congregants.

The demonstrators said they were there to protest David Easterwood, who is listed as a pastor at the church and appears to be the same David Easterwood who is a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. He was recently named as a defendant in a case brought by protesters who allege immigration agents had violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights.

“David Easterwood, out now!” protesters yelled at one point.

None of the videos show Easterwood in the church, and it’s unclear if he was in the building on Sunday. In response to CNN’s inquiry about his connection to ICE, a DHS spokesperson responded, “DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers.”

Federal investigation promised

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced an investigation within hours, calling the protesters’ actions “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

Dhillon cited the FACE Act, a federal law that “prohibits the use or threat of force and physical obstruction that injures, intimidates, or interferes with a person seeking to … exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.”

A surge in immigration enforcement around Minneapolis, known as Operation Metro Surge, brought thousands of additional federal agents to the area and prompted widespread protests, especially after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7.

The swift promise to investigate the demonstration stood in contrast to the administration’s response to Good’s death, as the Department of Justice quickly quashed an inquiry and refused to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies on their own investigation.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a former president of the local NAACP chapter, told The Associated Press she considered the threat of an official investigation a sham.

“If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and they need to check their hearts,” she said.

Cities Church has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment. A St. Paul police vehicle was briefly seen parked outside the building Monday morning, and no one answered when a CNN crew rang the doorbell.

Who is David Easterwood?

The man targeted by protesters Sunday is the acting field office director in St. Paul for Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE. In a declaration filed in this month’s lawsuit by protesters, Easterwood said he has worked for ICE since 2015.

Easterwood argued in his statement any order from the court would “further endanger the safety of law enforcement personnel and the public.”

Judge Katherine Menendez found ICE agents had been overzealous in pulling over some demonstrators who were following agents in vehicles.

“The Court has carefully considered and weighed Director Easterwood’s account of how vehicles have been used by observers to protest ICE activity in the Twin Cities,” Menendez wrote. “But, even crediting his statements about incidents of misconduct among other people following Operation Metro Surge, it simply does not establish reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop as to these particular plaintiffs.”

Despite Easterwood’s testimony, Menendez issued a largely symbolic injunction ordering agents not to detain people “who are engaging in unobtrusive protest activity, including observing the activities of Operation Metro Surge.”

Just days after taking his current position, Easterwood appeared alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news conference on immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities.

“Our officers demonstrate every day what it means to serve with honor and dedication,” Easterwood said in October.

Easterwood does not have a listed phone number, and requests for comment sent to his office were not immediately answered.

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. She also blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “for whipping these mobs into a frenzy and then allowing them to run rampant.”

With emotions running high and confrontational tactics escalating on both sides, Sunday’s protest highlights the growing tension between protecting free expression and silencing opposing voices.

“The question that we’re coming to is how law enforcement is going to protect the rights of protesters to engage in their First Amendment-protected activity, and at the same time not be intimidating other people for whatever rights they are engaged in,” CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero said.

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said. ""We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.""

Can This Lawyer Change That?,"Michael Steinberger, www.nytimes.com, michael-steinberger",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/magazine/genocide-trial-human-right-international-law.html,"“It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says.
At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters.
Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world.
“We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.
He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose.","Despite the carnage in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and even in the face of the Trump administration’s apparent determination to dismantle what remains of the liberal international order, the human rights attorney Philippe Sands insists he is not giving in to despair. “It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says. “It’s a long game.” Coming from Sands, who has devoted most of his career to trying to contain the darkest human impulses, the cautious pessimism is almost encouraging. He concedes, however, that it does feel as if the lessons of the 20th century are being cast aside and that the same sinister spirits that led to Auschwitz, Rwanda and Srebrenica are enjoying a revival. “There is definitely something in the air.”

Sands, who is 65, is among the pre-eminent figures in his field and has taken part in a number of landmark cases. He was a lawyer for Croatia in the genocide claim that it brought against Serbia, helped lay the groundwork for the prosecution of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor and was a member of the legal team that sought to hold the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet accountable for torturing and murdering political opponents. More recently, he was the lead outside counsel in the successful campaign to get Britain to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and argued for Palestinian self-determination in a case before the International Court of Justice. He also played a key role in the establishment of a tribunal to investigate Russia for crimes of aggression against Ukraine. Over the last three decades, few people have done more to shape the direction of international criminal law than Sands.

His latest book, “38 Londres Street,” was recently released in the United States. It recounts the indictment of Pinochet in 1998, his arrest in London and the ultimately unsuccessful quest to make him stand trial. The book, which takes its name from the building in Santiago that housed one of Pinochet’s clandestine torture centers, is also about the relationship between Pinochet and Walter Rauff, a senior SS officer — he developed the mobile gas chambers that the Nazis used to murder around 100,000 people — who fled to Chilean Patagonia after World War II.

The book is well timed. Scenes in the United States of masked law enforcement officers grabbing people off the street have evoked comparisons to Pinochet’s Chile and to Argentina’s Dirty War. Sands, whose wife, Natalia Schiffrin, is American (his brother-in-law is the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz), says there is “at least the embryo of a parallel.” What especially troubles him is the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision granting presidents almost blanket immunity. As Sands asks: “If a president commits crimes against humanity, tortures or disappears people, is he going to be subject to examination by the courts? The answer appears to be no.” Sands fears that the Supreme Court, 80 years after the Nuremberg trials established that political and military leaders could be held accountable for atrocities against their own citizens, has ushered in what he calls a “new age of impunity.”

On the international front, certainly, the Trump administration feels unconstrained by existing laws and norms, a point demonstrated by the U.S. military incursion into Venezuela and acknowledged with disarming candor by the president himself in a subsequent interview with The Times. “I don’t need international law,” Trump said. Amid all this upheaval, Sands is currently arguing another major case before the I.C.J.: He is representing Gambia in the genocide claim that it filed against Myanmar over its treatment of the Rohingya people. The trial opened last week in The Hague and is scheduled to run through the end of the month. If Sands and his colleagues prevail, it will mark the first time that a state has been held responsible for genocide. The I.C.J. has no direct means of enforcing its judgments, however, and in the context of the current moment, the courtroom proceedings might seem like a forlorn attempt to add scaffolding to a collapsing edifice.

Last January, Sands delivered a Holocaust Remembrance Day lecture at the University of Cambridge, his alma mater. Although his work often immerses him in stories of appalling cruelty, he is by nature very cheerful, and he exuded warmth and affability as he reflected on his Cambridge education and talked about his career. He counseled the students against cynicism. He noted that international human rights law was still in its nascency and said he remained optimistic that its core values would ultimately triumph. “I firmly believe that the arc of history will follow the arc of justice,” he said.

But he acknowledged that history seemed to be taking an unfortunate detour. Donald Trump was back in the White House, and Elon Musk had given what many observers interpreted to be a Nazi salute at an inauguration event and had also told a far-right rally in Germany that it was time to move beyond the country’s past, and Sands conceded that it was hard not to feel a sense of foreboding. “This could end very badly,” he said.

He grew up in the shadow of bleak times. His mother, Ruth, is a Holocaust survivor; as a toddler, she was spirited out of Vienna by a Christian missionary named Elsie Tilney and spent several years in France in the care of a series of Catholic families who hid her Jewish identity. Sands was raised in London (he holds British and French citizenship). His father, Allan, was a dentist; Ruth owned a children’s secondhand bookstore. He has a younger brother, Marc, who recently retired as an executive at an art auction house.

Sands entered Cambridge in 1979 intent on studying economics. But he quickly soured on supply-and-demand curves and switched to law. He found that pretty stultifying too, except for the class he took on international law. Although the professor was, in Sands’s words, “a very dry Yorkshireman,” he was enthralled by the subject matter. He says that it was “about all these things that were not talked about at home but were very, very present.”

Upon graduating, he spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. In 1984, he returned to Cambridge to work as a fellow at the university’s Research Center for International Law, which was under the direction of Elihu Lauterpacht, Hersch Lauterpacht’s son, with whom he formed a close bond. At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters. After the breakthroughs at Nuremberg, international criminal law had become largely moribund owing to the exigencies of the Cold War.

By contrast, international environmental law was an emerging subfield full of promise, and Sands became one of its pioneering figures. His foray into environmental law began with a paper that he wrote on transboundary pollution after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. He helped start the Alliance of Small Island States, which has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change, seeking to ensure that the interests of island nations, which are particularly threatened, are represented in negotiations over emissions reductions and other measures. In 1995, he helped write what remains a widely used textbook on international environmental law. Sands is now active in the movement to have ecocide — loosely defined as illegal or wanton acts committed in the knowledge that they are very likely to cause severe environmental damage — recognized as an international crime.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War created an opening to finally build on the legacy of Nuremberg, and the Balkan wars and the Rwandan genocide gave added impetus to that work. Pinochet’s arrest in 1998 in London appeared to mark a turning point in the fight for accountability: He was the first former head of state ever detained on foreign soil under the principle of “universal jurisdiction” — the idea that some crimes are so egregious that every nation has a right and a duty to seek to punish those responsible for them.

The British government released Pinochet in 2000, however, citing health concerns, and Sands says that after Sept. 11, the effort to make international criminal law more comprehensive and binding became significantly harder. According to Sands, “38 Londres Street” is in part an “elegy” for the time in the 1990s when the global human rights system seemed to take another step forward.

Still, even as progress slowed, Sands gained recognition for his deep knowledge of the law and for his litigating skills, and his expertise was sought not only by victims of human rights abuses but also by a few notorious oppressors. After Saddam Hussein was deposed and captured in 2003 by U.S.-led coalition forces, intermediaries reached out to see if Sands might be willing to provide legal advice to the Iraqi dictator if he was brought before an international tribunal (Sands wasn’t, and Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal of Iraqi judges).

A few years later, at the request of the Syrian government, Sands traveled to Damascus to discuss with President Bashar al-Assad the legal jeopardy that he might face as a result of the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon. There was speculation that the Syrian government played a part in his killing, and al-Assad wished to know if he, as a head of state, could claim immunity from potential prosecution. Sands told him he could not. He says that he was offering “an independent opinion” to al-Assad and was never asked to represent him. He adds that upholding international law occasionally requires speaking to the bad guys too.

To Sands, the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib was a shocking betrayal of the values that the United States claimed to represent, and President Obama’s failure to hold those officials accountable remains a source of disappointment to him. Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world. The postwar global order was principally an American creation, and this extended to the advancement of human rights. “The United States was the architect, very largely, of the rules that I have been involved with my whole life,” Sands says. “We saw it as the mansion on the hill, the guardian of the idea of the international rule of law.” But a year into Trump’s second presidency, that no longer seems to be the case. “We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.

In 2010, Sands was invited to give a lecture at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. He had never been to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, but it was where his maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz, was born and raised. Buchholz, who eventually settled in Paris, rarely spoke of Lviv or of the family that he lost in the Holocaust, a conspicuous silence during Sands’s childhood. After accepting the invitation, Sands decided to research the family history that Buchholz had never shared. In short order, he discovered the tragic fate of Buchholz’s mother and dozens of other relatives, and he learned too that Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht had both attended law school in Lviv. Sands also became acquainted with the sons of two of the men responsible for the deaths of his family members: Niklas Frank, whose father, Hans, administered German-occupied Poland during World War II and who was among the Nazi officials convicted at Nuremberg and executed; and Horst von Wächter, whose father, Otto, was the Nazi official in charge of Galicia, which included Lviv.

Sands told the stories of Hans Frank and Otto von Wächter and of how their sons reckoned with their crimes in a compelling 2015 documentary, “My Nazi Legacy,” which he wrote and narrated. Niklas Frank, who became a journalist, renounced his father and wrote a book harshly condemning him. Horst von Wächter is a more complicated figure. Although he later opened his family’s archives to Sands, he could not bring himself to accept his father’s culpability. The film’s most poignant scene comes when Sands, Frank and von Wächter visit the field not far from Lviv where in 1943 around 3,500 Jews were executed and buried, including some of Sands’s relatives (as well as relatives of Hersh Lauterpacht). Troops under the command of von Wächter’s father took part in the massacre. As Frank and von Wächter stand before a memorial commemorating the atrocity, Frank says, “This our fathers did.” From von Wächter’s stricken look, it seems clear that he knows the truth, but even then, he refuses to admit it.

A year after the documentary was released, Sands published “East West Street.” Part of the book is about the Nuremberg trials and the behind-the-scenes jockeying between Lemkin and Lauterpacht over how the defendants were to be charged. Lemkin wanted them tried for what he called “genocide” — for murdering people because they were members of a particular group, for killing Jews because they were Jews. Lauterpacht didn’t dispute that Jews had been victimized because of their identity, but he pushed to have the defendants charged instead with what he called crimes against humanity — with killing people as individuals. He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose. As Sands writes in “East West Street”: “By focusing on the individual, not the group, Lauterpacht wanted to diminish the force of intergroup conflict. It was a rational, enlightened view, and also an idealistic one.”

Lauterpacht prevailed at Nuremberg: In October 1946, 18 Nazi leaders were convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity, but the judgments against them made no mention of genocide. Lemkin’s lobbying efforts did not go unrewarded, however. Two months after the verdicts in Nuremberg, the United Nations voted to designate genocide an international crime. And in the decades since, largely owing to the enduring resonance of the Holocaust, genocide has come to be regarded as the more consequential and damning accusation — the “crime of crimes,” as Sands puts it. He finds this regrettable; crimes against humanity are no less heinous than acts of genocide, and he believes they should carry just as much opprobrium. But the bigger problem, in his mind, is that because the word “genocide” has such powerful connotations, it is often used carelessly and as a cudgel.

The pitfalls of the genocide charge became apparent to Sands when he represented Croatia in the case that it brought against Serbia in 1999 (another lawyer on the team was Keir Starmer, now Britain’s prime minister). The allegation centered on the massacre in November 1991 of several hundred Croatian P.O.W.s and civilians by Serbian paramilitaries; the killings took place near Vukovar, a city in Croatia. When the I.C.J. finally issued a decision, in 2015 (the wheels of international justice are especially slow to turn), it declined to categorize the slaughter as genocide. The ruling infuriated Croats, and their outrage was compounded by the fact that the same court had earlier affirmed that the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica, also by Serbian paramilitaries, did meet the definition. (The court ruled that those Serbian units committed genocide but concluded that the Serbian government itself could not be held responsible for the atrocities.)

Sands told me that this remains a source of resentment in Croatia. “Many people believe there will be another war because the Croats didn’t get their genocide. And their anger is against the Bosnians, who got a genocide. So you ask yourself the question: Why is that a socially useful outcome?” He says that Lauterpacht anticipated the danger in elevating genocide to a crime — that it would sharpen tribal instincts and make it more likely, not less, that eliminationist desires would be acted on — and that he has come to share this view. Intellectually, he stands with Lauterpacht.

At the same time, he admits that he is very sympathetic to Lemkin’s position. During a talk at the City University of New York last March, Sands recalled visiting the site near Lviv where his relatives were murdered. “Standing above that unmarked mass grave,” he told the audience, “it was impossible for me as someone who is Jewish not to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the people who were there simply because they were Jews who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.” They were unquestionably the victims of a genocide. So were the Tutsis in Rwanda and the Bosnian Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica. And despite his frustration with how promiscuously the genocide charge is invoked, Sands is confident that he can make it stick in the case against Myanmar.

More than six years later, Gambia v. Myanmar has now gone to trial at the I.C.J. Under international law, genocide is difficult to prove. Sands and his colleagues must be able to show dolus specialis, or specific intent: They have to establish, through direct evidence or compelling circumstantial evidence, that the only reasonable inference the judges can draw is that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya were motivated wholly or partly by genocidal impulses. On the first day of the hearings, Sands told the court that his side would demonstrate that the violence inflicted on multiple villages by Myanmar’s military met that threshold. Just as in Srebrenica, he said, what occurred in those villages presents “the inescapable conclusion that the crimes against the Rohingya who lived there were perpetrated with genocidal intent.”

One reason the trial in The Hague is being closely watched is the implications that it might have for a case that the I.C.J. is expected to hear later this year: the genocide allegation that South Africa has brought against Israel over the war in Gaza. A determination that Myanmar committed genocide could foretell a similar judgment against Israel. If, on the other hand, the I.C.J. clears Myanmar, it would be interpreted as a positive sign for Israel. Many observers think the court would be reluctant to turn history on its head by making Israel the first nation found guilty of genocide.

What’s more, the judges will be under considerable pressure, because the case against Israel could have onerous consequences for them. The Trump administration has sanctioned a handful of judges and one prosecutor with the International Criminal Court over its 2024 decision to issue arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defense minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and it will undoubtedly seek to punish the I.C.J. if it rules against Israel. (The I.C.C. prosecutes individuals; the I.C.J. adjudicates disputes between countries.)

According to Sands, there is a simple explanation for his reticence: He hasn’t wanted to make any public statements that might prejudice the Myanmar case. What he is willing to say is that he thinks Lemkin would have regarded Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as genocidal, but so too the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack that prompted it. He also points out something else. In 2019, Time magazine published an article about Netanyahu that noted that he was reading “East West Street” and included a photo of him with the book in his hand. Sands’s son (he has three children) had the picture framed. “One thing we can say with certainty,” Sands says, “is that Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of what Raphael Lemkin considered the crime of genocide and needs no lessons from anyone on the dangers he is likely to face on the basis of his actions.”

But even as he argues another case in The Hague, Sands has come to believe that the law isn’t the only avenue for establishing truth and accountability, or necessarily always the best one. Near the end of his talk in Cambridge, Sands took questions. One student suggested that as a condition for ending the war in Ukraine, Russia was likely to demand that any criminal charges against Vladimir Putin and other officials be dropped. (The recent peace plan endorsed by President Trump included full amnesty for all parties.) How, he asked, would Sands “balance the tension between stopping more violence and seeing justice for violence that has already happened?”

Sands said that in any situation in which a civilian population has been brutalized, the crimes must be acknowledged. “You have to find a way to address what happened,” he said. But he went on to tell the student that his work as a writer had broadened his view of how justice might be achieved. He mentioned, by way of example, the role that literature has played in helping Chile recover from the horrors of the Pinochet era. “It has had a profoundly important impact,” Sands said. He also cited Patrick Radden Keefe’s book “Say Nothing,” about sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/01/magazine/01mag-sands-HP-square/01mag-sands-HP-square-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:58:58.906844

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it’s worth speaking out, and it’s worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump’s actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump’s authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society.

""We're one of the only churches that are having in-person service. Most Latino churches don't have a service because even citizens and legal residents are afraid to come out or to go to the store,"" Pastor Sergio Amezcua said.

Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began Operation Metro Surge in December, Amezcua has been helping families who don't feel safe leaving their homes.

When he first asked his assistant to put out a call on social media, he thought they would receive a few requests.

""That was at 11 a.m. in the morning and by 7 p.m., my assistant called me and said, 'Pastor, a lot of people registered.' I was like, '20 families? 10?' 'No, 2,000,'"" Amezcua recalled.

According to Amezcua, so far they've been able to help approximately 14,000 families, but around 25,000 families are registered.

Right now, they're distributing anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 pounds of food per week with the help of hundreds of volunteers.

""It looks like they're responding to a hurricane catastrophe, but it is a mental catastrophe what the government is doing with us in Minnesota,"" Amezcua said.

DHH Church is helping families from not just the metro area but across the state. They also provide food to 20 churches, 10 schools and a refugee organization.

""Our refugees and our immigrant community... are going through hell and that's not the America... that we know,"" Amezcua said. ""I want to make clear... that from a conservative pastor, what Donald Trump and the White House is doing is horrible. We feel betrayed by him and his White House. That's the way we feel.""

Amezcua recalled getting a phone call from a mother who was reusing single-use diapers, saying, ""She was washing the diapers and I said, 'No, no, no'... I sent a text, if you can donate diapers. Our volunteer force showed up with what you see here.""

On the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, DHH Church was full of volunteers and people dropping off donations. Amezcua said once he realized food banks would be closed for the holiday, he started texting people. The community quickly mobilized. They plan to help 700-1,000 families on Monday alone.

""This is one way that takes no skill. Just takes showing up and I think we gotta keep showing up for stuff,"" said Brian McDermott, a volunteer who also dropped off food donations on Sunday.

Amezcua said with 25,000 families registered, they can't reach everyone. He's hoping to train more churches to do what they're doing.

Federal response to ICE lawsuit

The backstory:

A federal judge has fast-tracked a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government over increased ICE activities. The judge denied an immediate halt to the activities, and Attorney General Keith Ellison has since sent a letter to the judge requesting a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order, citing what he said were escalating harms from the federal government’s actions.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud, as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. The lawsuit alleges the enforcement activities are impacting schools and businesses, with local leaders urging federal agents to stop using what they describe as excessive force and start wearing body-worn cameras.

Officials have emphasized the lawsuit is not an attempt to try and block immigration enforcement altogether, but rather to stop what they describe as unlawful federal enforcement.

The other side:

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly criticized the state and Minneapolis leaders, accusing them of protecting criminals in their opposition to ICE.

What's next:

The judge ordered federal officials to submit their response to the lawsuit no later than Monday, Jan. 19. The plaintiffs will then have until Thursday, Jan. 22, to respond to those arguments.

Federal officials have not filed a response as of Monday morning.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.
In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal.","As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon’s legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump’s second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized.

One year ago, Trump’s executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump’s birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city’s Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for.

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon’s plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

‘We’ve always strived to be a more perfect union’

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump’s comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven’t always been perfect, but we’ve always strived to be this more perfect union, and that’s what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland’s first Black governor and only the nation’s third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration’s priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement.

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday’s focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King’s ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don’t judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

Groups call for holiday of reclamation, education and rallying

The NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn’t, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said.

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

Indiana school cancels historic MLK Day event

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis.

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school’s Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported.

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church’s “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people’s safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26017756118578.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-19 12:58:04.556951

The latest ICE Out! event drew protesters who outlined specific demands for Richmond and Virginia officials regarding immigration policy.

""We need to shut down all detention centers in Virginia. We need to ensure legal and financial support from the state and from the city for those detained. We must ensure that Richmond does not renegotiate any contract with Flock surveillance cameras or any other surveillance technology,"" one protester said.

Sunday's rally continued the momentum from last weekend's demonstration on Broad Street where around 300 people protested the deadly shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Richmond protesters demand justice after Renee Good killed in ICE shooting

Last Saturday's protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend, with demonstrators braving heavy rain as they assembled underneath the Maggie Walker statue to express frustration over Good's shooting.

""This is what that actually looks like, coming together for something good instead of violence and domination and terror,"" Te'Shaun Cleckley, one of last weekend's demonstrators, said.

Good, an Old Dominion University graduate and mother of three, was shot three times by the federal agent in an encounter captured on multiple cellphone videos that have sparked nationwide scrutiny.

The Trump Administration has defended the agent's actions, with President Trump stating Friday: ""We will always be protecting ICE and we will always be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.""

Cleckley urged fellow protesters to continue fighting for justice in Good's memory.

""Our mobilization to fight for justice and for liberation and for dignity and equity for everybody, isn't necessarily rooted in the reality that we're going to win,"" Cleckley said. ""It's rooted in the fact that we love the world around us, we love the people around us and we love the people that are gonna come after us. So my message would be, don't stop.""

Spanberger's policy reversal marks a sharp departure from Youngkin's approach, which included consistent support for ICE operations.

As a result, within the Fifth Circuit, providers cannot rely on the No Surprises Act (NSA) itself to enforce Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) awards in court and face a heightened standing bar for ERISA-based claims where patients are insulated from financial harm. And the persuasive effect of the Fifth Circuit’s holding is bolstered nationwide.

Background

As we explained previously, Guardian Flight arose out of efforts by air ambulance providers Guardian Flight and Med-Trans to collect payments awarded through the IDR process under the NSA. After prevailing in multiple “baseball-style” IDR proceedings against an insurer, the providers alleged that the insurer failed to pay the awards within the 30‑day deadline required by the NSA. They sued to enforce those awards, asserting: (1) direct claims under the NSA; (2) derivative ERISA claims based on assignments from plan beneficiaries; and (3) a Texas quantum meruit claim. The district court dismissed across the board, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the NSA does not create a private right of action for providers to enforce IDR awards, that the providers lacked ERISA standing because NSA‑protected beneficiaries suffered no concrete financial injury, and that the quasi‑contract claim failed because the services were rendered for the patients, not for the insurer.

Issues Presented in the Cert Petition

The certiorari petition asked the Supreme Court to review two issues with potentially far‑reaching consequences for NSA and ERISA litigation. First, it asked whether a breach of ERISA plan terms is itself an injury in fact to a plan beneficiary even where the beneficiary is insulated from out‑of‑pocket harm by the NSA’s balance‑billing protections, and therefore whether assignee‑providers can rely on that breach alone to establish Article III standing. Second, it asked whether, when Congress made NSA IDR awards “binding” and directed that insurers “shall” pay them within 30 days, it intended to permit providers to sue in court to enforce those awards, rather than leaving enforcement exclusively to administrative agencies. The petition argued that the Fifth Circuit’s answers to both questions deepen existing splits among the circuits on what constitutes a concrete injury under Spokeo and Ramirez, and on how to read statutory “binding” and “shall pay” language in the private-right-of-action context.

Practical Impact in the Fifth Circuit

With the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari, the Fifth Circuit’s analysis now firmly governs within Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and will be influential elsewhere. In practical terms, providers in the Fifth Circuit cannot bring standalone NSA claims to compel payment of IDR awards, and must instead look primarily to federal and state regulators (such as Health and Human Services) or to contract‑based remedies to address nonpayment. ERISA‑based claims will continue to face heightened standing scrutiny where patients are shielded from financial liability, as the Fifth Circuit treats the plan’s alleged failure to pay as a “technical” breach insufficient, by itself, to constitute a concrete injury to the beneficiary. And state‑law quasi‑contract theories remain constrained by the court’s view that services performed for patients do not satisfy Texas’s requirement that services be rendered for the defendant’s benefit.

Numerous other district courts throughout the United States have followed the Fifth Circuit’s lead in finding providers lack a private right of action to enforce IDR awards, and we expect the denial of certiorari will add further support for district courts considering the issue in the future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14355_0412.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:58:25.579400

Martin Luther King Jr., communities in the Bay Area will celebrate the legendary civil rights activist’s legacy by making their voices heard, amid the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deport historic numbers of immigrants.

“This year is not just about honoring history, it’s about practicing for the future,” said Gina Fromer, CEO of San Francisco social justice organization GLIDE. “I have no doubt that we need to march many times this year in defense of our rights. Dr. King said hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

Fromer said GLIDE’s annual march, which gathers at the San Francisco Caltrain station at Fourth and King Streets and has been a local tradition for 41 years, is intended to mirror the Selma to Montgomery protest marches of 1965.

Across the Bay Area, activists are seizing the moment and transforming what is typically a yearly opportunity to give back through acts of service into a day of political action. Throughout the Bay Area, residents are honoring MLK’s desire to strengthen community and building local resilience through shoreline cleanups, food distributions and interfaith gatherings.

This year, Fromer said, Glide’s march will advocate for “radical inclusivity” at a time when the rights of LGBTQ+, unhoused and immigrant communities are threatened. She noted that the current administration’s attacks make the late leader’s message of “unconditional love” more important than ever.

In the East Bay, the Freedmen Federation and Faith In Action East Bay have organized a Unity Vigil at Richmond’s City Hall to address what they call “state-sanctioned violence.”

Kira Lee, a professor and organizer with the collective, said the recent death of Los Angeles resident and U.S. citizen Keith Porter Jr. in ICE custody and sightings of federal immigration agents in Richmond have made it impossible to separate the holiday from the current political moment.

Lee called the surge in enforcement an “exercise in othering” that targets residents across race and citizenship status. “I don’t view this as an immigration issue. I view this as a racial issue,” Lee said.

“I view it as slave catching, where state violence is being used to decide who belongs and who doesn’t. Black and brown families have been screaming for protection this entire time.”

In the tradition of giving back, South Berkeley high school students with the youth design nonprofit Girls Garage will unveil their renovation of a home for an older Black couple this weekend.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday will mark the culmination of a year-long project to repair damage done by an unlicensed contractor that had left the family home unlivable and them at risk of displacement.

Emily Pilloton-Lam, the nonprofit’s founder, said that community-led projects offer people realistic ways to take action during periods of national uncertainty. And encouraging young women and gender-expansive youth to lead the remodel, she said, sends a powerful message.

“It is a very, very difficult time to maintain hope when we see what’s going on all over the country,” Pilloton-Lam said. “Projects like this bring us back down to a really human scale of one family, one neighbor and local organizations. It’s a reminder that we still can make a really big difference in the lives of individuals in our immediate community.”

While President Donald Trump scrapped free entry to National Parks on MLK Day, adding his own birthday to the calendar, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that visitors can enjoy free entry at more than 200 of California’s state parks for MLK Day.

“Dr. King’s legacy deserves to be honored, not erased,” Newsom said in a statement. “I’m encouraging all Californians to get outside on MLK Day, spend time in nature, reflect on Dr. King’s legacy, and reaffirm our commitment to advancing civil rights for all.”

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:11.862244

“Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting?","Advances Election Integrity Investigation with Legal Action

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to compel the release of public records showing whether, and to what extent, it is guarding against voting by illegal aliens. The suit, filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on January 16, stems from the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles’ (DC DMV) failure to respond to FAIR’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on November 12, 2025.

This legal action is a direct follow-up to FAIR’s ongoing investigation, launched in November 2025, into jurisdictions with policies that pose a high risk of facilitating voting by illegal aliens. To date, the investigation has focused on states like California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington—all of which engage in automatic voter registration, universal mail-in voting, and the issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. FAIR’s investigation seeks to determine whether adequate measures are in place in these jurisdictions to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote, and to ensure compliance with federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the REAL ID Act.

FAIR’s FOIA request to the DC DMV specifically sought records, policies, and communications detailing how the agency distinguishes between U.S. citizens and noncitizens during voter registration processes, verifies citizenship status before transmitting data to election officials, and handles data from non-REAL ID-compliant credential holders. Since FAIR submitted its request in early November 2025, the DC DMV has provided no substantive response, determination, or records—an egregious violation of DC FOIA’s mandatory timelines.

“American citizens deserve confidence that their elections are secure and free from interference by those who are not eligible to vote,” said Dale Wilcox, FAIR’s Executive Director and General Counsel. “The District of Columbia’s refusal to provide these basic records raises serious questions about whether safeguards exist to protect election integrity. FAIR is committed to holding governments accountable and ensuring transparency in how voter rolls are managed, especially in jurisdictions with policies that invite abuse.”

“The DC DMV’s stonewalling is unacceptable and undermines public trust in our democratic processes,” added Mateo Forero, FAIR’s Director of Investigations and counsel of record in the case. “Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting? By forcing the release of these documents through litigation, we aim to expose any vulnerabilities and push for reforms that prioritize lawful participation in elections.”

That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”","Bruce Springsteen denounced the Trump administration’s deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in cities across the United States and dedicated a song to Renee Good, the woman recently killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, at a surprise performance in New Jersey on Saturday.

Appearing at the Light of Day Winterfest in Red Bank, N.J., Mr. Springsteen told the crowd: “We are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years is being tested as it has never been in modern times,” according to videos that circulated online.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?
Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney.","An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, on Jan. 7 when she attempted to drive away as agents tried to get her out of her vehicle. Two days later during a vehicle stop in Portland, Oregon, a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded two Venezuelans. One of them, Luis David Nino-Moncada, recently pleaded not guilty of aggravated assault against a federal officer and damaging federal property.

Soon after, protests erupted across the country in both blue states such as California and New York and red states like Texas — which saw large demonstrations in Houston, Austin, Dallas and other cities.

Trump, who made mass deportations a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, reiterated his administration's commitment to the policy in a press release on Wednesday, linking higher deportations to lower housing costs, higher wages and lower crime.

During his second term, Trump has shifted the government's focus from border enforcement to arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants from the nation's interior. Daily ICE arrests in Texas have jumped from an average of 85 per day during the final 18 months of the Biden Administration to 176 per day in the first six months under Trump, according to a Tribune analysis.

Undocumented immigrants in Texas have reported staying home as much as possible to avoid being targeted by immigration officers or police.

Meanwhile, ICE facilities in Texas and elsewhere have been targeted: In September, a 29-year-old man fired on an immigration enforcement office in Dallas, killing two detainees and wounding another. Just a few months earlier, a group of nearly a dozen people attacked a detention center in Alvaro with tactical gear and weapons, injuring a local law enforcement officer.

Here's what to know about how ICE is operating in Texas and what rights people have when approached by an agent.

How is ICE arresting people in Texas?

The most high-profile operations are street raids, where ICE agents, often accompanied by state troopers and local police, target a particular area or business and arrest groups of undocumented immigrants.

Some of the biggest raids have taken place in and around Houston: In May, ICE said it deported more than 500 people and arrested more than 400 suspected undocumented immigrants in and around the city in roughly one week. In October, ICE carried out another massive operation in Houston over the course of 10 days, in which they said they arrested more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.

ICE has focused mainly on the state's large urban areas, but earlier this year, according to Border Report, the head of the South Texas Builders Association said agents have been raiding construction sites along the border.

But the most common way ICE agents track down undocumented immigrants is through the local criminal justice system. Immigration agents can request that jails hold an undocumented person who has been jailed, then turn them over to ICE for deportation. The Harris County Jail leads the country for such immigration holds, also known as ICE detainers, according to a Tribune analysis.

ICE is also increasingly targeting immigrants when they arrive for court hearings or routine immigration appointments; ICE agents have arrested people at federal buildings in El Paso, immigration courts in San Antonio and probation offices in Dallas.

How and why does ICE work with local police departments?

Early in Trump's second administration, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to support federal immigration enforcement operations in tracking down and deporting undocumented immigrants.

Some sheriffs in Texas have signed agreements to work closely with ICE to enforce immigration laws. A new state law passed in last year's legislative session requires sheriffs in all counties with a jail to enter into such agreements, also known as the 287(g) program, this year. Since Trump returned to the White House, more than half of ICE arrests in Texas have come from local jails, according to the Tribune analysis.

Even in Democrat-run Texas cities like Austin and San Antonio, where local leaders in the past have stated their police won't cooperate with immigration officers, the state requires local police departments to support ICE operations — a policy adopted by other states like Florida and Louisiana.

According to KUT, the Austin Police Department on Thursday announced that officers have ""general orders"" to work alongside federal immigration officers to execute immigration warrants. In March, Houston police were instructed to call federal immigration authorities if they come across a person who has deportation orders in the national crime database.

Are any places off limits to ICE agents?

The Trump administration, early in his second term, rescinded federal policies that limited arrests of immigrants in sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals.

But to enter private spaces such as homes and businesses, immigration agents and police still need a warrant signed by a judge to enter.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?

Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney. If an agent doesn't have a signed warrant, people have the right to refuse them entry into their home and the right to refuse searches, regardless of their citizenship status. Agents have the right to pat a person down to check for weapons.

The American Civil Liberties Union advises people to stay calm and not resist or obstruct the agents. They also advise people not to lie to agents or give them fake documents.

They recommend that people memorize phone numbers of their family members and friends, and their lawyer. If they take medication, have a plan for another person to give those medications to agents if they are arrested.",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19082548/0401-ICE-Raid-Minor-EG-26-1500x1001.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:12.088434

President

Arab American Institute

How did we get to the point where the president can say and do things that put our culture and democracy at risk, and it’s just shrugged off as if it were normal?

In social media posts and unscripted press comments he uses language that would have been unimaginable coming from a president in any other period of American history. In just the past few months, Mr. Trump: was photographed making an obscene gesture and mouthing a vulgarity at a demonstrator; demeaned a popular TV personality who had just been murdered; called a Somali American member of Congress garbage, adding that all Somalis were garbage; called the Governor of Minnesota “retarded,” an especially hurtful slur as that governor has a son with a disability; and insulted women reporters who asked him challenging questions, calling them “ugly,” “obnoxious,” and “stupid.”

Parents wouldn’t tolerate this from their children and yet here we have a president of the United States demeaning his office by speaking in such a deplorable manner.

It’s not just the president’s speech that has been so “unpresidential.” Mr. Trump’s need to gratify his ego has led him to make exaggerated false claims about his grievances and his successes. He claims that he has been attacked by media, Congress, and law enforcement agencies like no other president in history. At the same time, he boasts that he has improved the economy and made our cities safer than they have ever been. None of this is true.

In an effort to impose his will and worldview, he has surrounded himself with White House staff and Cabinet that not only heap praise upon him and carry out his every whim, but also support his efforts to silence and intimidate those whom he has denounced as critics.

Herein lies a fundamental difference between President Trump’s first and second terms. In the former, some senior members of his staff and Cabinet served as a check on his behavior. Many were fired and replaced. He began his second term with a detailed plan to transform government, and with a more compliant senior leadership (e.g., the Department of Justice and FBI are willing to order investigations of his critics).

This combination of unchecked power, the president’s need to have his every ambition fulfilled, and his disrespect for law and precedent has led to actions that are illegal. In the first few months, his administration put in place a program to remove over 300,000 government employees. He shuttered USAID, the Voice of America, and the US Institute for Peace—all illegal actions as these were congressionally created and funded entities. He later reopened the Institute for Peace as the Trump Institute for Peace; renamed the nation’s premier center for the arts The Donald J Trump, The John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts without any authorization; and had the White House’s East Wing torn down to be replaced by another vanity project—a massive ballroom—which no doubt will also bear his name in the near future.

Conceivably the most dangerous of President Trump’s moves have been the dramatic expansion of ICE—the immigration enforcement entity—and its unleashing in US cities, posing a direct threat to American democracy.

In recent weeks Mr. Trump sent a massive contingent of ICE agents to Minneapolis, Minnesota ostensibly to root out illegal immigrants, while attempting to embarrass that state’s Democratic governor and to target one of Mr. Trump’s new favorites, Minnesota’s large Somali community. As expected, ICE’s arrests have been indiscriminate, detaining many legal residents and citizens, and their behavior unacceptably brutal. As seen in other cities, ICE behaviors have provoked widespread protests. In one horrifying incident, a member of an observer team monitoring ICE behavior was shot and killed through an open car window by an ICE agent.

The shooting was filmed from multiple angles, establishing that the victim posed no threat to the ICE agent. That didn’t stop the president and other administration officials from propagating a lie about what had transpired. They called the murdered woman a domestic terrorist, saying she’d threatened the life of the ICE shooter. Unwrapping this murder is instructive on many levels.

First, with the enormous budget appropriated for ICE expansion, that entity now has over 10,000 armed agents. The rapidity of its growth has led to inadequate vetting and training. More dangerous still is how ICE has recruited agents: at gun shows and right-wing events, and targeted advertisements on right-wing radio shows. The White House appears to be forming an ideologically cohesive national police force that is anti-immigrant and violence-prone and has been told by the administration that they can act with impunity.

This incident also points out the extent to which the White House is capable of fabricating a storyline that will be echoed by other leaders and their supportive media outlets. The impact is clear. A recent poll showed that, by a wide margin, most Americans believe that the woman’s killing was wrong, but more than three-quarters of Republicans believe the president’s narrative that the murdered woman was a threat to the ICE agent and her killing was justified.

So, how did we get to this point? The answer is clear. A president who says whatever he needs to say to justify his position, officials around him and a supportive media who vociferously agree with him and threaten those who disagree, and a cult-like movement of partisans who will believe what they are told even when the facts speak to a different reality.

… [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.” The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced.
Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman.
In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents.
Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.","It was more than five years ago, but Democrats are still hurting from self-inflicted wounds caused by the slogan “Defund the Police.”

The right-wing media’s echo chamber keeps bellowing those words with delight. They aim to make all Democrats look like they foolishly want to open the door to criminals. Now, Trump-approved media has a new siren call: “Abolish ICE.” They want any whisper of those words to become a weight to sink Democratic candidates and blunt what is widely forecast to be a blue wave in November.

Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington, is warning about the political trap being set for Democrats: “The impulse is emotional. The slogan is simple. But politically, it is lethal,” cautions a recent memo. “Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want. … [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.”

The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. And they can be enforced in ways that protect public safety…[voters] understand this. They responded strongly to what they saw as a lack of enforcement under President Biden. But they are also recoiling from Trump’s excessive force.”

Slogans aside, there are legitimate calls for Americans to take bold action. Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman. At the White House, the press secretary publicly asked a reporter why Good died. “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably,” came the reply.

Under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE has undergone massive expansion — with funding now rivaling or exceeding that of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, making it one of the most heavily funded federal law enforcement forces in the country.

How did an immigration enforcement unit become the largest police force in the U.S.? The sad answer is that President Trump is using ICE’s growing presence in America’s cities to normalize the presence of armed federal agents on any street corner. Last week, he threatened to use the Insurrection Act to supplement ICE’s threatening presence with the U.S. military.

The president’s goal is to scare people into silence to halt rising dissent.

In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents. Local officials are plainly saying that these agents are making communities less safe.

What can congressional Democrats do about it?

Here is a to-do list.

First, impose congressional oversight.

Second, call Noem to the hearings and enlist Republicans to consider impeaching her if she does not reduce the budget and the size of this paramilitary force.

Third, call Vice President JD Vance to public hearings. Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.

Vance has a law degree and knows better. This is not a matter of “qualified immunity.” That doctrine protects state and local police from civil lawsuits for errors made as they properly protect the public.

Even with “qualified immunity,” it is important to codify its ICE limits and clear the way to apply accountability for egregious abuse of the public trust by armed agents of a democratic government.

The second Trump administration is barely a year old. He is ignoring legal limitations by unilaterally deciding to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to grab the country’s leader. Even before that act, he defied Congress by using U.S. military missile strikes to kill Venezuelan boat passengers he claimed were drug traffickers. That was way beyond appropriate action, including arrests and boat seizure, normally taken by the coast guard and customs officials.

Don’t forget that Trump’s officials have yet to offer evidence that the people on those bombed boats were drug dealers.

Now this imperious use of force by a president’s administration has come to the homeland, and an American woman lies dead at the hands of ICE.

This cannot go unanswered by Democrats in Congress.

They are in the minority in both the House and Senate. But Democrats have to reach for leverage, including using the threat of a government shutdown to express their outrage at the bloodshed in Minnesota.

Democrats will have a leverage point in two weeks, when the government runs out of funding.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was right to allow an end to last year’s budget shutdown and to let Republicans hang themselves by ending ObamaCare subsidies that gave health care to millions.

A shutdown is still a dubious idea. But murder by a federal agent demands a response.

As we approach the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States this year, the words of our second president, John Adams, ing with renewed urgency:

“Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Trump recently said the only limit on his power is “my morality.” Is that the explanation for his administration’s refusal to hold to the Constitution?

George Conway, the conservative lawyer now running for Congress in New York as a Democrat, put it bluntly: “The President of the United States is a criminal… He has no loyalty to the law or to the Constitution.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26016127809169.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:07.178946

But the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk or drive in the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.

ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wider emphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.

The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due process started to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budget surpassing most of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.

To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographic overwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.

Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in the propaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good, served in Iraq.

I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.

The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda as ministers attend Home Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. The empowerment of the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest.

A group of protesters interrupted Sunday morning services at a St. Paul church because one of the pastors works with a federal immigration agency, according to police.

At approximately 10:40 a.m., officers were called to the Cities Church in the 1500 block of Summit Avenue after receiving reports that some 30 to 40 protesters had interrupted services, according to police spokesperson Nikki Muehlhausen.

By the time officers arrived, the group had left and was walking down the alley, she said.

In a Facebook post, protesters said they went to the church to ask for justice for Renee Good because they had identified a church pastor as the acting director for the St. Paul field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The church’s website lists David Easterwood as a pastor. Easterwood is listed as a defendant in a Jan. 12 lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota to halt the federal immigration crackdown that led to the fatal Jan. 7 confrontation between Good and an ICE agent. He also defended ICE tactics in an earlier filing on Jan. 5.

DOJ investigation

Later Sunday, Trump administration officials condemned the protest at the St. Paul church, which is is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, a conservative Protestant denomination headquartered in Nashville, Tenn.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it is investigating. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents’ actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

“When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood’s personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

Easterwood’s earlier statements

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They’re going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ’s prosecution was misguided.

“If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?” Cullars-Doty said. “We can’t sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.”",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STP-L-CHURCH-0119.jpg?w=1024&h=567,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:15.838709

Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.
The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.
Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics.
Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:29.056374

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday night, Blanche said the civil rights unit of the Justice Department would not bow to pressure to investigate the shooting death of Minneapolis resident and mother Good, 37, earlier this month.

“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody,” said Blanche. “We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate.”

“So, no, we are not investigating. And if there comes a time when we need to, we will, but it’s not now,” Blanche added.

Increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers have erupted in Minneapolis since Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot behind the wheel of her car while protesting by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.

Blanche also said that footage of Good’s death has already “been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones when it happened”.

However, analysis conducted by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and APM Reports found that there still remain questions about the shooting, including why it allegedly took more than 10 minutes after Good was shot before she was given CPR.

According to the MPR and APM reports, ICE agents left Good “bleeding and alone in the car for almost three minutes” and “turned away a man identifying himself as a physician who offered to help”.

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good up to four times, was acting in self-defence.

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and White House adviser Stephen Miller, have also said that ICE officers have “absolute immunity” for their immigration enforcement actions.

Meanwhile, lawyers representing Good’s family said last week that they have launched their own “civil investigation” into her death.

“People in Minneapolis and across this country truly, truly care about what happened to Renee Good on January 7, 2026, and are committed to understanding how she could have been killed on the street after dropping her child off at school,” lawyer Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.

Top Minnesota Democrats under investigation

Blanche also separately confirmed reports that the DOJ has launched an investigation into Minnesota Governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, alleging the two Democratic leaders were “encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE”.

Blanche’s comments are the first time a member of the Trump administration has confirmed media reports that Walz and Frey are under investigation.

“No matter who you are, whether you’re a governor, a mayor or somebody out there on the streets assaulting ice, you cannot, under federal law, you cannot impede a federal officer doing their job, and that’s what we’re looking at,” said Blanche.

Responding to earlier media reports that the DOJ had launched its probe, Frey said he would “not be intimidated”.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey said in a post on X.

Walz, meanwhile, responded to the reports indirectly, saying in a statement: “Weaponising the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ap_696da9a40bdaa-1768794532.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:35.484365

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic.","Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan is about twenty paces wide, curb to curb. Front Street, the main business street in Nome, Alaska, about four thousand air miles to the northwest, is two paces narrower but feels just as wide. Usually, there aren’t a lot of cars or pedestrians on Front Street, and the buildings that line it, none of them tall, seem to lean back from it. More dust and sand and rain and snow blow down Front Street than vehicles drive on it. Standing in line in the cheery post office on West Front, Nome-ites talk and laugh and exchange news. On days when the sand is blowing, some have goggles hanging from their necks or pushed up on their foreheads.

Nome’s sand contains gold, and other minerals. The iron in it will turn white cars a dingy yellow over time. During drier periods, small sand ripples form in corners along the streets, like sand on the bottom of a lake. Since the discovery of gold here, in 1898, billions of dollars have been taken out of Nome’s beach and from the bottom of the Bering Sea, just offshore. With gold at more than four thousand dollars an ounce, the gold dredges move constantly back and forth on the water on calm days in early fall. Ungainly with their beams and pipes, the dredges look like tufts of Rust Belt infrastructure that have blown loose and drifted westward and finally tumbled onto this distant sea. Rainy days turn the sand and dust on Nome’s streets into a thin grayish silt. This is what a place looks like when its streets are paved with gold.

The city of thirty-seven hundred residents is almost as far west as you can go in North America. Front Street parallels the sea, whose storms and giant blocks of ice have sometimes beaten the business district flat. Gold’s current valuation is just one of many international factors to keep in mind here. The Russia-U.S. border, which follows the International Date Line, is less than a hundred and fifty miles away. Provideniya, a Russian town with a formerly large military base, is two hundred and thirty miles from Nome. Cruise ships from Europe that have travelled the Northeast Passage route over the top of the planet stop in Nome, as do ships that have followed the Northwest Passage across northernmost North America.

Along the Alaskan coastline, it’s about a hundred and ten miles from Nome to Wales, the continent’s westernmost point. From Wales, it’s twenty-five miles to the Russian island of Big Diomede, and fifty-two miles to the coast of Chukotka, as that easternmost district of Russia is called.

Starting in 1999, I used to come to Nome to do research on a book I was writing about Siberia. I wanted to go from Nome to Russia, a goal that involved complications and extra trips on this side. One morning, in a Nome café called Fat Freddie’s, I met Jim Stimpfle, Nome’s most famous citizen, a man of grand ideas. The card he gave me listed him as a director of the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel & Railroad Group, whose intention was to dig a tunnel from near Wales to the “Chukotka Nose,” the very tip of Russia and of Asia, and to build a railroad that would go up the coast of North America, pass through the tunnel (“Just forty-one miles longer than the Chunnel!” Stimpfle said), and connect to another yet-to-be-constructed railroad, in Russia.

Stimpfle became famous in this way: His father was a dentist in Washington, D.C., with patients and friends in the diplomatic corps. Stimpfle wanted to be a diplomat himself, but after he graduated from George Mason University, in 1970, he ended up in Alaska, where eventually he married a Native woman, Yaayuk Bernadette Alvanna, whose family came from King Island, which is off the coast north of Nome. He became a real-estate agent; he says he has been inside almost every building in Nome. Through his wife, he learned that Natives on this side—the Yupik and the Inupiat—remembered relatives on the Russian side whom they hadn’t seen since J. Edgar Hoover and the Soviet government shut down cross-border travel and communication, in 1948, creating what became known as the Ice Curtain.

In the nineteen-eighties, Stimpfle decided to devote his spare time and energies to breaching that curtain, reëstablishing Russian-American connections, and reuniting Native relatives. By September, 1987, his efforts to restart travel back and forth had got the attention of Alaska Airlines and Exploration Cruise Lines. The Wall Street Journal did a front-page article about this lesser-known border, and quoted Stimpfle. After that piece, more reporters wrote about him. They said that Jim Stimpfle, a local real-estate agent and a private citizen in Nome, was working to end the Cold War.

At the Alaska Aviation Museum, near the airport in Anchorage, a Boeing 737 with the logo of Alaska Airlines on its sides and the company’s emblem of a smiling, parka-wearing Native man on its tail sits with other mothballed airplanes outside a hangar. A plaque beside it reads “Historic Flights to Russian Far East: Friendship Flight, Nome-Provideniya; June 13, 1988.” On that day, Stimpfle and seventy-nine other officials, reporters, and ordinary Alaskans, including thirty Native people, flew in this plane for an inaugural visit.

Photos of the delegation show Stimpfle on board among other smiling folks leaning over the seat backs and talking and standing in the aisle. He had coined the term “Friendship Flight,” and as the president of the Nome Chamber of Commerce had been agitating for the idea tirelessly. Mead Treadwell, at the time a young Yale graduate who had already been involved in Alaskan politics for a decade, remembers Frank Murkowski, then a U.S. senator, saying to him, “Mead, I’ve been getting Stimpfle’s faxes every day for a year and a half.” Murkowski was just one of dozens of officials whom Stimpfle besieged.

After the Friendship Flight took off from Nome, it flew for about forty-five minutes and landed on the gravel runway at Provideniya’s airport. The cabin door opened, uniformed Russian officialdom entered, and a pattern began that would be repeated many times—the checking of documents, the standing in line, the triple-thump of passport stamping, the boarding onto not-new buses, the arrival at a dim official hall, the salty snacks, the sit-down banquets, the ryumki (shot glasses) standing in rows, the toasts being raised bezkonechno (without end), the mutual incomprehension, the unmoored good cheer.

I went up the boarding stairs to the plane and stepped into its open door. The passenger seats had been removed and benches installed along the walls. When you’re an airline passenger, knee to spine with your neighbors, you forget that what you’re in is just a big tube. The almost empty piece of aluminum echoed and creaked.

Stimpfle still lives in Nome and is still its most famous citizen. I went there in September, and he was the first person I called. Fat Freddie’s has closed, and Stimpfle now patronizes the Polar Cub Café, where he sits with friends at the same table almost every morning. Just beyond the café’s broad windows, the waves of the Bering Sea batter the granite riprap frontage. One morning, Stimpfle joined me at a corner table. I’d last seen him twenty-four years ago, an interval that has slowed us both. He wore a brown knit cap with a bill, a zippered jacket, loose knee-length blue shorts over gray sweatpants, and black running shoes. He is tall and strong-looking, and his blue eyes, which used to spark behind his spectacles and sharp nose, have grown mellow.

Looking across the expanse of sea, he talked about his first attempts to contact somebody—anybody—on the Russian side. He began by filling balloons with air or with exhaust from his car and writing messages on the balloons themselves. Then, on a strong east wind one day, he released a weather balloon that he had filled with helium. Attached was a capsule containing small gifts—tobacco, sugar, tea, and sewing supplies—and a message of friendship which a schoolteacher in Nome had translated into Russian. Stimpfle watched the balloon rise and move offshore. Then the balloon began to descend, landed on the sea, and bounced along the surface. A seal hunter who happened to be passing by saw it and took it into his boat. He opened the capsule, saw the notes in Cyrillic, and thought the balloon must have come from Russia.

By following the boat along the coast, Stimpfle tracked down the hunter, Tim Gologergen, and explained about the balloon. Soon afterward, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship, the Surveyor, docked in Nome. Its captain had received an invitation from the mayor of Provideniya, Oleg Kulinkin, to bring his ship to its harbor for a brief visit—something that had not happened in sixty years. Stimpfle gave the Surveyor’s captain a message to pass to Kulinkin. The captain did, and when the ship returned to Nome he brought a message from Kulinkin to Stimpfle. That was the first success Stimpfle had in reaching someone across the strait. When the Friendship Flight went to Provideniya, a year later, he met the mayor in person. Tim Gologergen was on the flight, too, and found relatives in town, to whom he spoke in Yupik.

Stimpfle added, “I heard that Kulinkin was later murdered by the Russian mafia in the Russian Far East city of Magadan, in a hotel where I had stayed myself.”

In 1991, Alaska Airlines began regular service to Magadan and Khabarovsk, a city well into Russia, on the Amur River. For a while, the Russian Far East seemed like an extension of North America’s West Coast. Aeroflot began to fly into Seattle and Anchorage. Once, in the mid-nineties, in the Seattle airport, when I was on my way from Montana to Los Angeles, I talked to a man from Orlando, Florida, who said he worked for a Saudi-owned oil company at a site on Sakhalin Island where he oversaw an operation involving supertankers and pipelines and underwater infrastructure maintained by teams of scuba divers, who also brought up delicious crabs that he ate. He said the fishing there was excellent, even right offshore. He then got in line for his Aeroflot flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, boarding on the same concourse as my flight to L.A.

Trans-strait connections multiplied. In the fall of 1988, a pod of gray whales became stranded in an iced-in pocket of the Beaufort Sea, off the city of Barrow, on Alaska’s North Slope, and a Soviet icebreaker arrived and opened the obstructed water and apparently freed them—they were seen no more. Between March and May, 1989, a combined expedition of Russian and U.S. sled-dog teams trekked from the city of Anadyr, in Chukotka, to the city of Kotzebue, on the Baldwin Peninsula, with an airlift from Nome for the last stretch. An Inuit Quaker evangelist named Robert Sheldon led a five-man Native expedition going in the other direction, from Alaska to Chukotka, by snowmobile. They needed a helicopter lift over the strait, which by then was no longer freezing all the way.

Provideniya and Nome agreed to declare themselves each other’s sister city. Bering Air, a prop-plane airline started in Nome by a couple from Michigan, began flights to Provideniya and Anadyr. Direct phone service was established; previously, calls from one side to the other had to go all the way around the world, via Moscow. A group of Soviet Young Pioneers visited the Nome Boy Scouts. Stores in Nome put up signs in Cyrillic and began to accept rubles from Russian tourists, who had started to come. Later, the stores were stuck with the rubles when the Russian government would not exchange them for dollars or let them be brought back into the country. The stores made gift packets of rubles and sold them as souvenirs.

A charitable group flew a Russian burn victim across the border for care in the U.S. Dancers from Provideniya performed in Nome, and there was a game between the cities’ youth basketball teams. The local paper, the Nome Nugget, reported that, with the border open, three Nome-ites had found spouses from Provideniya. The story said that the Alaskan men liked how the Russian women dressed, in skirts and high heels at ten below zero.

Hundreds of Russian students came to the University of Alaska campuses in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and exchange programs took Alaskan students to Russia. Sylvia Matson, whose ancestors were mostly Finns, had recently moved up from Sandstone, Minnesota, to join her husband, who had found a job as a mechanic at Bering Air. Not only is her husband also a Finn, but his name is also Matson—just by coincidence, because both families, when they arrived in the U.S., replaced their complicated Finnish last names with Matson, after a transoceanic shipping company. When she heard about the exchange program with Russia, she pushed to be accepted for it, even though she was a part-time student and not really qualified to apply. An exception was made, and in 1990 she and four other Alaskan students began the fall semester at the State Pedagogical Institute of Magadan, the public university in that city about twelve hundred miles west of Provideniya.

Magadan had a deadly reputation in the Stalin era, as a hub for Gulag mines where political prisoners slaved sometimes to death and produced gold and other minerals in the process. Matson arrived in September and moved in with a host family in which the father was a doctor and the mother an engineer. The entire district was rationing food, and people did not have a lot to eat. She thinks the family got extra food because she was staying with them. She ended up spending more of her time teaching than learning. Russians who speak English tend to have British accents, but as relations with the U.S. improved there was a vogue for speaking with an American accent. The students and teachers with whom Matson practiced English for many hours a day could not get enough of talking to her, and almost wore her out. They may have been surprised to learn afterward that other Americans they spoke to assumed they had learned their English in Minnesota.

With other students, she went on excursions into the forest, or taiga, saw abandoned and crumbling Gulag camps, rarely ate in the dining hall at the Pedagogical Institute (whose food was “really challenging”), and joined in the parade in early November honoring the glorious October Revolution. The school made clear that the American students were required to be a part of the event, which turned out to involve not marching but just kind of walking down Lenin Avenue to Lenin Square and buying stuff from street venders. She got the impression that the Russians who attended did not really want to be there.

In general, Matson and the other exchange students didn’t have much to do but be American. People invited them to dinner in their apartments. “There were families that asked me to come just because they wanted an American in their home,” Matson said. “It was humbling. To be treated to a lavish meal, and to have their children put on a special performance for you. And the little girls would give you their favorite doll—it was heartbreaking, and you couldn’t say no. Or they would just gaze at you and want to sit beside you on the couch. They dearly wanted to give to you because you had gifted them with your presence in their home. It was hard for me to know how to navigate that, at age twenty-four.

“When I left, in mid-December, my host family presented me with a lot of gifts, and a fur hat, and I knew there was an expectation that I invite them to visit me in Nome. But I couldn’t do that, for private reasons. I disappointed them, I know, and we did not keep in touch. Now my husband is retiring from Bering Air at the end of this year, and we’re moving back to Minnesota. We just sold our house and sent a container of our belongings on the container barge down to the Lower Forty-eight. As I was packing up and throwing out, I put aside the gifts the kids and grownups had given me in Magadan, and I’ve donated them to the historical museum here. The Russian women always said I didn’t dress up enough or use enough makeup. I still had the tin of pancake makeup they gave me. Now the museum has it, along with my students’ notes of appreciation, and the kids’ drawings, and a Russian Soviet Republic flag, and the dolls from the little girls. The museum says that at some point it will do a display about the years when Nome was in friendly contact with the Russians, and I’m glad these things will be in it.”

My own trip from Nome across the border happened in August, 1999. I flew Bering Air in a tour group consisting of two couples and me. Vladimir Bychkov, our guide, who met us in Provideniya, is a Russian Army kid from Chukotka, born when his father was stationed there. A mild and competent man, he would later become Provideniya’s mayor, occupying the same office once held by Jim Stimpfle’s first Russian contact, the apparently ill-fated Oleg Kulinkin. I had travelled a bit in western Russia by then, and Provideniya looked like other post-Soviet towns, except that large parts of it were ruins. After the Soviet Union ended, in 1991, remote places like this had been left on their own. The city’s population dropped drastically, and many of the high-rises were empty, with their windows smashed out and small waterfalls flowing down their front steps. After a few days in the town, we travelled by Army vehicle and boat to visit Native villages and stayed in fishing shacks or tents.

About a year later, the mood in the region had changed. People were talking about Roman Abramovich, the oil-and-aluminum billionaire, who was running for governor of Chukotka, mystifying everybody. Why would one of the world’s richest men want to be the governor of this abandoned, farthest-flung part of Russia? But he soon began to campaign throughout Chukotka and give money to local charities, and in December, 2000, he won the election, replacing the almost comically corrupt previous governor, Aleksandr Nazarov. Abramovich then opened new businesses in Anadyr and set about spending more of his own money on bettering the lives of local residents. He and his team rehabbed housing, repaired roads, reimbursed residents who had gone for years without receiving their salaries, brought in ships carrying food and supplies, and paid for talented kids from the region to study in Alaska. Chukotka residents hung portraits of Abramovich in their apartments the way Soviet citizens once hung portraits of Lenin.

I became friends with Ken and Tandy Wallack, whose company, Circumpolar Expeditions, had arranged my visit. They live in Anchorage, where many of Abramovich’s projects took him. The Wallacks have worked on all kinds of journeys on the other side of the strait. When an American adventurer with time and money wanted to go up the coast of Chukotka and across to the U.S. in a Native umiak, or walrus-skin boat, to show that humans could have come to North America by boat rather than on land—a kind of sub-Arctic Kon-Tiki—the Wallacks found Native people to make his boat for him and guide him. The Wallacks also helped Fiat, the Italian car company, negotiate the Russia-to-Alaska leg of a publicity trip around the world in special heavy-duty Iveco trucks, and handled logistical problems for Philippe Croizon, the French quadruple amputee and distance swimmer, when he swam between the Russian and American islands that Lynne Cox had linked in her famous cross-border swim in 1987. The Wallacks speak only English, but they have a gift for understanding the heavily accented English that different kinds of people speak, and then repeating it in English that interpreters can understand.

At the request of Abramovich, who had hired them, and whom they remember as pleasant and unassuming, they found places to stay for the hundred and fifty Chukotka high-school students he brought to Anchorage in groups of fifty at a time. The Wallacks set up visits to public schools, trips to McDonald’s, and other American activities. “For some reason, Abramovich wanted them all to go bowling,” Tandy Wallack said. “So we found a bowling alley for them and got them started—none of them had ever bowled—and they bowled.” The oligarch came and went in his private jet and kept a spare jet in Anchorage in case another might be needed at short notice.

In 2008, for reasons as opaque as his intentions in taking on the role, Abramovich resigned his governorship and went elsewhere in his extremely complicated and tiring-to-think-about billionaire’s world. The charities he set up for the people of Chukotka continued to exist, supposedly, but the interlude of benign mega-capitalist visitation in this part of the world was over.

“It all just kind of petered out,” Jim Stimpfle told me, in the Polar Cub Café. “The time of druzhba [friendship] across the border just ended. I went back to real estate full time. My wife had got tired of my spending so much effort with all this Russia business. And there was all the corruption, and the shakedowns, especially the landing fees that the Russian airports kept jacking up for Alaska Airlines and Bering Air, who both finally had to stop flying over there.” Alaska Airlines ended all its flights to the Russian Far East in 1998. Bering Air continued to operate an occasional charter flight until service to Russia entirely stopped with the war.

Part of the problem was that most people in the Russian Far East remained too poor to come to the U.S. or trade across the border in any meaningful way. Russia also began to be perceived as too dangerous. There were stories of American sailors beaten and robbed in Anadyr, of Japanese nature-documentary crews arrested and then released only after all their equipment had been confiscated. On one of the Wallacks’ trips to Chukotka, in the twenty-tens, when they were helping to make a documentary about an Alaska Native’s search for her relatives, authorities in the village of Lavrentiya detained them and their crew for having forgotten some paperwork. One by one, the Americans had to appear before a judge, plead guilty, and pay a fine. Some of the Native people of Chukotka, for their part, had grown tired of the stream of evangelists from North America. A Canadian preacher made a video of Natives screaming and crying and throwing themselves on the floor during a come-to-Jesus moment that he had brought about. Other Natives found the video demeaning when it was circulated. A few neighborly gestures still occurred—in the winter of 2012, Nome almost ran out of heating oil, and a Russian tanker arrived in mid-January to resupply the city. But after Russia’s seizure of Crimea, in 2014, remaining civilian communication across the strait began to shut down, and it dwindled to nothing in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nome’s geographic internationality helped inspire Jim Stimpfle to work for Russian-American understanding and peace. Since February, 2022, it has motivated other Nome-ites to go to war.

Mark Hayward, a military veteran and a former Special Forces medic who moved to Nome in 2018 with his wife, was in the predominantly Native community of Savoonga, on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, on February 24, 2022, the day of the invasion. He had gone there as an employee of the Norton Sound Health Corporation to teach residents how to be their own first responders and save lives until victims could be air-transported to better medical care in Anchorage or Seattle. You can’t see Russia from Wasilla, Alaska, but, if you go up on a hill on a clear day, you can see it from St. Lawrence Island. “I’m ashamed to admit, I had checked out of the world,” Hayward told me, by phone. “But, when that invasion happened, I was so freakin’ mad. There’s the Russian coast, less than a hundred miles from Savoonga. If Putin can roll tanks into his neighbor, why wouldn’t he send a sub up here to sink a tanker carrying the oil that keeps my family alive in the winter? When I got home, I knew what I had to do, and so did my wife. She said, ‘You’ve read the news. Get your ass on a plane and get over there.’ ” He left soon afterward, intending to join the foreign-volunteer legion defending Ukraine.

I first learned about Hayward from an article in the Washington Post by Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News. (He is a college friend of my daughter’s; she put the two of us in touch.) Hughes had gone to Nome last winter and met Hayward in person, but by the time I went, in September, readers of the Post article had sent Hayward money to support his war efforts; one had even funded his return to Ukraine. While walking around Nome, I came upon and tried to make sense of the city’s former hospital building, which sprawls in an indeterminate shape and contains the offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a car-repair garage, a pawnshop, the Nome courthouse, and the labyrinthine workshops of Rolland Trowbridge, an enterprising man who bought the building and damaged his knee crawling around in its crannies as he rehabbed it for its present uses. Trowbridge is a collaborator of Hayward’s, and has assembled military matériel in his workshop for Hayward to send to Ukraine via the international courier Meest, which specializes in transporting packages between Ukraine and North America.

I found Trowbridge by asking at the pawnshop. He’s a tall and big man with a well-trimmed beard and mustache, thick, dark eyebrows, and no hair at all north of that. For everyday life, he wears work boots and button-downs. He showed me what he was working on: shrapnel-deterring body armor made of Kevlar fabric sewn with Kevlar thread on his extra-large sail-making sewing machine. (Trowbridge is a sailor who first came to Nome in his own sailboat, amazingly, from Michigan.) In other nooks sat a one-person motorized paraglider that has a range of a hundred and fifty miles and resembles something that Wile E. Coyote might use, and several intricate multifaceted handheld devices for jamming the radio signals that guide drones.

In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Nome residents had joined Jim Stimpfle in his projects of trans-strait druzhba; now dozens of them, by Trowbridge’s estimation, are helping Trowbridge and Hayward help Ukraine. Nome-ites have donated supplies, labor, and money raised at benefit events. He showed me slides of two used yellow-and-green Mercedes-Benz ambulances that he and Hayward bought with the money they raised, and drove from the U.K. to Ukraine in the summer of 2024. His and Hayward’s main achievement so far, he said, has been generating power for a Ukrainian arsenal of Javelin missiles that lacked functioning ignition and guidance systems. He said that by tinkering they put together twelve-volt motorbike batteries with improvised wiring that got the Javelins’ circuitry to work. Then the Ukrainians took these high-tech armor-piercing weapons to the front and “started poppin’ tanks” with them, Trowbridge said, forcing the Russians to turn back their advance on the city of Mykolaiv, a maneuver that could have led to the encirclement of the entire Black Sea region.

He showed me shelves and tables heaped with black, shiny Chinese electronics that he was testing and adapting. “I happen to know a lot about which Chinese equipment is good and which is junk, and how to order the best, which the Ukrainians generally can’t. And you always need to keep buying more of it because drone warfare is changing every day.”

Later, when I talked to Hayward in Mykolaiv from my hotel in Anchorage, he texted me a photograph of a sea-mammal-harpoon point made of shiny steel that he had brought to Ukraine from Savoonga. He also has a motorized paraglider with him. He said he planned to attach the point to a spear and take it up with him in the paraglider so he can harpoon an Orlan-10, one of the sophisticated drones that are killing Ukrainians. “I’m in this war all the way,” Hayward said. “I’ve spent down my I.R.A. and run through my savings. If Putin isn’t stopped here, he will keep on going, and we will all end up living in his gangster world. I’ll give everything I’ve got to stop him, and if I spend all my kids’ inheritance and more helping to create a world where aggression like this cannot stand, that’s an inheritance I’m proud to leave.”

In Nome, Trowbridge told me that he is worried about Hayward. He said, “I’m afraid Mark won’t be satisfied until he gets himself killed there.”

Gay Sheffield, the Bering Strait agent for the University of Alaska’s marine-advisory program in Nome, responds to concerns about sea mammals, subsistence-food sourcing, and environmental change in the region. She also serves as the commissioner of the Port of Nome. The scientific papers she has written or contributed to get down to the real details of life in the area. As someone who has spent a lot of my free time removing debris from trees in the five boroughs of New York City, I was drawn to a 2021 paper, of which she was the principal author, about a “marine debris event” in the Bering Strait in 2020. The study reported that, over the past two decades, five hundred metric tons of seaborne garbage had been collected from the shorelines in and near fifteen coastal communities. Much of it was “industrial fisheries debris”—floats and nets, pallets, deck boots, and various other items “with Russian, Korean, or other Asian lettering.”

Kitchen trash, vegetables, roach-spray cans, air fresheners, bathroom cleaners, a Russian Navy sailor’s cap, disposable gloves, water jugs, food packaging, juice bottles, men’s body-wash bottles—all had sloshed around in the strait and washed up on Alaskan shores. The absence of tampons or diapers in the debris suggested predominantly all-male groups of litterers, such as tanker or fishing-boat crews. The study said the debris could have come from a foreign ship that sank—given the lack of information from the Russian side, who could say? It stated and restated that without meaningful international communication the debris problem cannot be solved.

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic. I hoped to meet Sheffield, so I stopped by the University of Alaska campus when I was in Nome, but she was on a research trip. When I spoke to her later, she told me that the federal government is not focussed on what is going on in the region. “Only two federal agencies are still in Nome,” she said. “The F.A.A. and the post office. The Parks Service office is closed because of the shutdown. NOAA has reduced its presence. So that means that, basically, the citizens of Nome and the coastal villages are trying to keep track of what’s going on in the region by themselves.

“The toxic algal bloom that happened in 2022 was by far the largest event of its kind ever seen in the U.S.,” she went on. “It stretched for more than six hundred kilometres in the strait and the Chukchi Sea, and certainly must have extended into the Russian side. Ultimately, we have no idea how much harm it caused, since much of it was carried out into the open sea, and onto the Russian coast. A lot of marine animals died, but we can’t be sure whether it was the algae that caused it. Consuming toxic marine life would have caused serious health problems in the region. The warming of the water and the continuing absence of sea ice have consequences. A big one has been the increase in industrial maritime traffic. More and more Russian tankers are bringing liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Ob through the Russian Arctic, through the strait, and down to China. The federal managers for our maritime resources may have stopped paying very much attention to the region, but the Russians and the Chinese and those of us who live here have not.”

At the Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, in St. Petersburg, Russia, there is a model of the Earth about fifteen feet across that you can walk around and study from above. What makes it different from other big globes is that it represents only the top part of the planet, no more than a quarter of the total sphere—that is, the entire Arctic and a few degrees latitude below it. Mead Treadwell, who moved to Alaska forty-seven years ago to work on Wally Hickel’s campaign for governor, has prospered there in the pipeline and telecommunications businesses, held political office (lieutenant governor), and served on many Arctic commissions, forums, and institutes. He knows that top part of the planet as well as anybody. I missed him in Anchorage, but met up with him a week later in New York, at another place of convergences, the Explorers Club, on East Seventieth Street. His conversation centered on Alaska but swooped all over that top-view, Arctic-focussed globe—from the Bering Strait to Prudhoe Bay to Russia’s Taymyr Peninsula to Greenland to Iceland to Finland to Wrangel Island, that island beyond the beyond, north of Chukotka, where Treadwell made two expeditions in 1990 that qualified him to become a member of this club.

He agreed with Gay Sheffield that we don’t pay enough attention to our Arctic. “The Barents countries, like Norway, Sweden, and Finland—and also the Laplanders who inhabit them—know much more about their end of the Arctic than we do about ours,” he said. He talked about the natural-gas fields of the far north, and described a fleet of Korean-built, Finnish-designed liquefied-natural-gas (L.N.G.) icebreaker tankers that have spoon-shaped bows and pointed sterns so they can go bow first or stern first, depending on the nature of the ice, and transport L.N.G. to China from western Russia via the Arctic route efficiently and economically. (He believes we should copy them in moving our own North Slope L.N.G. from Prudhoe Bay by sea, rather than relying on pipelines.) Communication between the U.S. and Russia across the strait still exists, he said. On issues of marine safety, search and rescue, and environmental emergency, the U.S. Coast Guard in Juneau still talks to the Russian border-security agents in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and vice versa.

On the question of what is to be done today, he doesn’t know. “I always say that citizen-to-citizen diplomacy opened the border in the nineteen-eighties,” Treadwell said. “And failures of big-country diplomacy contributed to its closing, which started with Putin in 2000. First, Putin discouraged regional governors from doing international relations. Then he told the regions that he would be appointing the governors, and the citizens would no longer be voting on them. Those changes took power away from this neighborhood of the globe. His rise is a lot of the reason the border shut down. I think we could’ve done more with other Arctic-facing countries to counter that shift in power and keep our neighborhoods healthy.

“But there’s always change,” he continued. “A delegation of businessmen accompanied Putin on his recent Alaskan summit with Trump. I don’t know what subjects were discussed. But a lot can be done internationally with mining, shipping, fisheries, energy extraction, and tourism in our shared Arctic. Just because our Russian border appears to be mostly closed, don’t think people aren’t thinking about and planning for a different future.”

In September, 2022, two men who lived in the town of Egvekinot, in Chukotka, decided to escape from military recruiters who had been knocking on their doors. The men filled a sixteen-foot outboard motorboat with supplies and containers of gasoline and set out across the bay next to their village, then braved the open Bering Sea. After several days’ journey, they reached St. Lawrence Island—U.S. soil. Somehow, they had avoided swamping, sinking, drowning, exposure, hypothermia, or capture by the Russian border patrol. Soon after they arrived, U.S. immigration officers flew over from the mainland, arrested them, and brought them to a detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

The office of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, in Tacoma, took their case, and by January, 2023, it had won their release. According to Nicolas McKee, the staff attorney who represents both men, one of them has received asylum and lives in Washington State. The other is waiting for a decision in Alaska, where he has a fishing job in a Russian-speaking community.

Some thirty-five thousand Russians travelled by various routes to the southern border of the U.S. and asked for asylum there in the war’s first year alone; many have suffered in long confinement and with uncertain prospects. As far as anyone knows, the two men from Egvekinot are the only recent Russian asylum seekers to have come from the part of Russia where the United States is so close that under the right circumstances you can see it. McKee thinks that anyone else who succeeds in crossing the Russian-Alaskan border, as his clients did, will also have a good chance of receiving asylum. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea96e40e629c67c05020d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r48407.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 07:58:05.528895

Protest disrupts church services in St. Paul

What we know:

Activists with the Racial Justice Network disrupted church services at Cities Church in St. Paul to oppose a pastor at the church.

Protesters went to the church because they say the pastor in question, David Easterwood, is also the acting field office director for ICE in Minnesota. The protest was documented in part by former CNN anchor turned YouTuber Don Lemon. Video from Black Lives Matter Minnesota also show protesters chanting during services.

""This cannot be a house of God while harboring someone directing ICE agents to wreak havoc on our community,"" attorney Nekima Levy-Armstrong told Lemon during his livestream, explaining why the group was at the church. ""I am a reverend on top of being a lawyer and an activist, so I come here in the power of the almighty God.""

Dig deeper:

FOX 9 can confirm a man named David Easterwood is the acting field office director in Minnesota. Easterwood is routinely named in DHS court filings. However, FOX 9 wasn't able to confirm acting director is the same David Easterwood listed as a pastor on the CIties Church website.

The other side:

Easterwood did not appear to be on hand for Sunday's services. But the church's lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, did speak with Lemon.

Parnell said the protests inside the church were ""shameful."" ""It's shameful to see anyone interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship,"" said Parnell. ""I have to take care of my church and my family.""

Parnell then asked Lemon to leave unless he was there to worship.

DOJ says they are investigating

What they're saying:

Sunday afternoon, hours after the protests, officials with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were looking into the disruption.

In tweets, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon responded to video of the protest by writing: ""We are on it @CivilRights, working with the USAO in Minneapolis. This is un-American and outrageous.""

Dhillon later added: ""The @CivilRights is investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers. Considering and investigating other related crimes as well. @FBI activated too!""

The FACE Act prohibits the use of force to prevent people from receiving reproductive health services, or exercising First Amendment rights at a place of worship.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/cities-church-protest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:40.245097

But it did include statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security that were not part of what Alfonsi had used before her story was pulled. Some of statements, which were carried in full on the “60 Minutes” website, were dated prior to Dec. 21.

“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said. “They declined our requests.”

Alfonsi did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Sunday. She said in her email that the administration’s refusal to consent to on-camera interviews was a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.

CBS says it was always going to air the piece

CBS News, in a statement said, that its “leadership has always been committed to airing the ”60 Minutes” CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”

Alfonsi’s report was the second of three on Sunday’s show, with the lead story being Cecilia Vega’s report from Minneapolis about ICE enforcement efforts and the protests to its tactics.

The initial decision to sideline Alfonsi’s CECOT story became a flashpoint for critics who said the appointment of Weiss, founder of the Free Press website who had no previous experience in television news, represented an attempt by the network’s new corporate leadership to curry favor with Trump.

While pulled from the broadcast in December, Alfonsi’s original story mistakenly became available online. CBS News had fed a version of the newsmagazine to Global Television, a network that airs “60 Minutes” in Canada, which posted it on its website before the last-minute switch removing the piece.

That enabled sharp-eyed viewers to see what Weiss had rejected, offering the opportunity to compare it to what “60 Minutes” eventually put on the air.

The body of the story was unchanged. It included a brief clip of President Donald Trump saying the prison operators “don’t play games,” and one from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that “heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, sexual assaulters, predators who have no right to be in this country” were sent there.

Alfonsi’s introduction was updated to lead with the Jan. 3 U.S. raid that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, currently held in U.S. custody. She changed the end of the story to include the administration comment, including its explanation for not providing detailed records on the migrants sent to El Salvador.

The administration also provided photos of tattoos worn by the two migrants Alfonsi interviewed, including one swastika that the interviewee said he had gotten as a teen-ager not knowing what it meant.

The CBS-administration relationship has evolved

Since Weiss’ appointment, Trump administration officials have been more visible on CBS News, in interviews that she sometimes helped arrange. The president himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on “60 Minutes” on Nov. 2.

The New York Times reported Saturday that after Trump was interviewed last week by new “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil, Leavitt told the network that “we’ll sue your ass off” if the exchange wasn’t aired in full.

All of the 13-minute interview was shown Tuesday, an unusual step for one of the broadcast networks’ evening newscasts, a half hour summary of the day’s big stories. CBS told The Times that it had decided to run the interview unedited at the time it was booked.

Trump has objected in the past to how his interviews have been edited — including releasing an unedited transcript of an interview conducted by Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” in 2020.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F06%2F796ff77b45da90fcc169f06ab782%2Fcorrection-media-60-minutes-trump-67068.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:00.868121

Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents to Minneapolis and the fatal shooting by an ICE agent of Renee Good in comments at the Light of Day Winterfest main event show Saturday, Jan. 17 at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank.

“I wrote this song as an ode to American possibility,” said Springsteen while introducing “The Promised Land.” “It was about a both beautiful but flawed country, that we are, and the country that we could be. Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it's never been in modern times.”

The audience broke into applause.

“Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now,” Springsteen said. “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty and believe the truth still matters, you must speak out and it's worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it. If you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens. If you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, send a message to this president as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the (expletive) out of Minneapolis.”

More waves of cheers came from the audience.

“This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three, American Renee Good,” said Springsteen, who then played the opening notes of “The Promised Land” on harmonica.

The Springsteen intro was similar to the Boss' state of democracy speeches he gave during the E Street Band's tour of Europe last year, which also criticized the Trump administration.

President Trump responded by attacking Springsteen on social media several times in response, including sharing a meme that depicted Trump hitting a golf ball and striking Springsteen, which knocks him down on stage.

The Light of Day, which has been supported by Springsteen, raises funds and awareness in the fight against Parkinson's and related diseases. In accordance with Light of Day history, Springsteen was not an announced artist at Saturday's show, which included performances by Gary “U.S.” Bonds, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, Dramarama, Remember Jones, Fantastic Cat, Williams Honor, James Maddock, Joe D’Urso and Stone Caravan, Wille Nile and more.

Springsteen first appeared on Saturday with Nile when he and Maddock joined the rocker for his “One Guitar.” The Boss returned to join Gruschecky and the Houserockers as they backed Bonds on “Jole Blon.”

“I knew they was going to start some (expletive),” said Bonds as he embraced by Springsteen.

“Bonds is (expletive) 86 years (expletive) old,” said Springsteen, 76. The Boss was instrumental in revitalizing Bonds' career in the early '80s by penning hits like “This Little Girl,” performed on Saturday, for Bonds.

“I got at least 10 more years in me, I know that,” Springsteen said.

“I love these young folks,” Bonds said. “I'm going to teach them how to rock 'n' roll.”

There was lots of rock ’n’ roll on stage Saturday night as the show lasted six hours, ending at 12:30 a.m. The nightcap was a performance of Springsteen's “Light of Day,” and then a rendition of Happy Birthday for festival founder Bob Benjamin, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1996.

He's now confined to a wheelchair. Springsteen stroked his hand after singing.

“This is somebody who has done more for the fight against Parkinson's than anybody I know,” Springsteen said. “Bob Benjamin, let's sing for him.”

The Boss ended the show with an acoustic rendition of “Thunder Road” with an audience singalong.

The recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer has further inflamed tensions surrounding the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, which have been present throughout President Trump’s second term.

Trump on Thursday warned of using the Insurrection Act following demonstrations in Minneapolis, but said a day later there was no reason to invoke the law immediately.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed her agency is working on an internal review of the actions of the ICE officer that killed Renee Good.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz) also said Sunday that he believes “ICE needs to be totally torn down.”

“It has to be created in the image of what people want, right? And what does that look like?” Gallego told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “From my experience running in Arizona, in a very hard, hard state when it comes to immigration and immigration issues, people want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals, right, and focuses on criminals, and immigration enforcement that is actually focused on security, and not the goon squad that has come from Stephen Miller and Donald Trump.”

Gov. Abigail Spanberger moved swiftly on immigration policy in her opening slate of executive orders, rescinding a directive from her Republican predecessor that expanded Virginia’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The order repeals former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Department of Corrections to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. The order also encouraged local police and sheriffs to do the same.

Repealing Executive Order 47 does not terminate existing 287(g) agreements. Under their terms, the agreements remain in effect until they are suspended or terminated by either party.

Spanberger’s executive order argues that the policy diverted limited law-enforcement resources away from core public safety functions.

It reads: “This executive order rescinds Executive Order 47, which requires and encourages state and local law enforcement to divert their limited resources for use in enforcing federal civil immigration laws,” the order states. “Ensuring public safety in Virginia requires state and local law enforcement to be focused on their core responsibilities of investigating and deterring criminal activity, staffing jails, and community engagement.”

Under 287(g) agreements, state and local law-enforcement agencies — including sheriffs’ offices and police departments — are authorized to carry out limited federal immigration enforcement duties under ICE supervision. Those functions can include identifying people in jail who may be subject to deportation, serving certain administrative immigration warrants on people already in custody, and, in some cases, deputizing officers with limited ICE authority during routine law-enforcement work.

According to ICE’s website, there are currently 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving local governments, state agencies and correctional facilities. Five of those agreements are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law-enforcement agencies.

Spanberger previewed the move in her inaugural remarks on Saturday, emphasizing her administration’s approach to immigrant communities.

“Our hardworking, law-abiding, immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them too,” Spanberger said.

Youngkin’s original order declared that “Virginia is not a sanctuary state” and argued that the “nexus between illegal immigration and dangerous criminal activity is real.” The policy drew condemnation from immigrant-rights groups and the ACLU of Virginia, while Democratic lawmakers criticized it as a misallocation of resources that undermined trust between communities and law enforcement.

House Republican Leader Terry Kilgore said the decision to end 287(g) agreements for state police would make Virginia less safe.

“This decision allows criminal illegal immigrants to remain in our communities and commit crimes over and over again by shielding them from cooperation with federal law enforcement,” Kilgore said. “That is not public safety — it is reckless.”

Former Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said the move was a “disaster for public safety.”

“Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised,” Miyares posted on X.

Mary Bauer, executive director for the ACLU of Virginia, said Spanberger’s executive order was a good start but that she now must end 287(g) agreements between state agencies and ICE.

“It is not the job of Virginia’s law enforcement agencies to carry out the Trump administration’s brutal and fear-based anti-immigrant agenda,” Bauer said. “(Spanberger’s) executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families.",https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0400-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:09.635315

Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.
Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.","1. Introduction

In Doe v. HHS (5th Cir. Jan. 16, 2026), Dr. John Doe—a physician challenging an Adverse Action Report (“AAR”) lodged in the National Practitioner Data Bank—sought reconsideration from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) of a prior refusal to remove the AAR. HHS denied the request with a terse rationale: that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.”

After Doe sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in the Eastern District of Texas, HHS defended on a different theory: that it denied reconsideration on the merits because Doe failed to identify new evidence sufficient to reopen. The district court dismissed the APA claim, treating the denial as effectively unreviewable because Doe had not presented new evidence.

The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that HHS’s shift in rationale violated the Chenery principle: a reviewing court may assess agency action only on the grounds the agency itself invoked in the administrative record.

Key issues

Whether HHS may defend an agency decision on a litigation rationale different from the rationale stated in the final agency action.

Whether HHS’s stated “ineligibility” ground was consistent with its own guidance governing reconsideration.

What remedy is appropriate when Chenery is violated at the motion-to-dismiss stage in an APA case.

Parties

Plaintiff–Appellant: John Doe, M.D., Ph.D.

Defendant–Appellee: United States Department of Health and Human Services

2. Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit held that HHS’s litigation position—asserting a merits-based denial for lack of new evidence—could not be used to uphold an agency action that, on its face, denied relief because Doe was “not eligible” for reconsideration. Applying SEC v. Chenery Corp, the court ruled that it could not credit post hoc rationalizations offered by agency counsel.

The court further observed that HHS’s own guidance contemplated that upon a reconsideration request, the agency would either affirm the prior decision or issue a revised final decision—yet HHS instead declared Doe “not eligible” for reconsideration, a position the court said was “not true” under the guidance language. The Fifth Circuit therefore reversed the dismissal of the APA claim and remanded for further proceedings.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) SEC v. Chenery Corp, 332 U.S. 194 (1947)

The decision rests on Chenery’s “simple but fundamental rule” that a court must judge an agency action “solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.” In Doe v. HHS, that meant the court could not affirm (or sustain a dismissal premised on) a rationale HHS did not provide to Doe in the administrative record. The operative ground was “not eligible for additional administrative review,” not “we reviewed your new evidence and reject it on the merits.”

2) Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623 (2023) (per curiam)

The Fifth Circuit used Calcutt v. FDIC to reinforce the modern Supreme Court’s insistence that courts are “powerless” to affirm agency action by “substituting” a better rationale when the agency’s own reasoning is “inadequate or improper.” Here, the district court’s approach—accepting the litigation theory that the denial rested on lack of new evidence—was functionally a substitution of grounds inconsistent with Calcutt’s instruction.

3) Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156 (1962)

Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States supplies the more specific administrative-law admonition that appellate courts may not accept “post hoc rationalizations” and that an agency order must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself. The Fifth Circuit treated HHS’s merits-based defense on appeal as exactly the sort of post hoc rationalization Burlington forbids.

4) McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1988)

The panel cited McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas in connection with the proposition that agencies must adhere to mandatory procedural language in their own guidance (or at least must supply a lawful explanation if they depart from it). The Fifth Circuit invoked this authority while noting HHS’s guidance describing what happens after a reconsideration request—suggesting HHS did not do what it promised it would do.

5) Prior litigation involving Doe and the AAR

The opinion situates the dispute against extensive prior proceedings where Doe tried to remove the AAR, including:

Doe v. Rogers, 139 F. Supp. 3d 120 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Doe I”)

[Doe] v. Rogers, 656 F. Supp. 3d 78 (D.D.C. 2023) (“Doe II”), aff’d sub nom. Doe v. Rodgers, No. 20-5297, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 3540 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2023) (“Doe III”), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 328 (2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., No. 181 N.Y.S.3d 884 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Medical Center et al., No. 2:10-cv-05588 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 2, 2010)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., 59 N.Y.S.3d 310 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017)

While these cases did not control the Chenery issue, they provide the procedural posture for why Doe sought reconsideration based on discovery materials and why HHS’s characterization of what it did on reconsideration mattered for APA review.

6) Judge Haynes’s pro se deference authorities

In a concurrence in part and dissent in part, Judge Haynes cited: Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989) and Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), emphasizing that pro se filings are construed with deference. Those cases informed Judge Haynes’s proposed procedural remedy (a limited remand to allow fuller presentation to the district court), though the majority resolved the appeal on Chenery grounds as to the APA claim.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) The agency’s stated ground controls

The majority framed the case as one where its “analysis begins and ends” with the agency’s stated rationale. HHS’s final agency action said only that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.” Under Chenery, that statement set the boundaries of judicial review: the court could not treat the decision as if it instead said “we considered your new evidence and deny reopening on the merits.”

2) A guidance mismatch underscored the inadequacy of the “ineligible” rationale

The court found the “not eligible” rationale inconsistent with HHS’s published guidance. The opinion quotes the National Practitioner Data Bank Guidebook as describing two outcomes after a reconsideration request: “Either the previous decision will be affirmed” or a “revised final decision will be issued.” The agency did neither; it issued a threshold ineligibility denial, contrary to the guidance’s described process. That mismatch mattered because it made the agency’s stated ground appear factually and procedurally defective, and it prevented the court from accepting HHS’s later attempt to recast the denial as merits-based.

3) The district court’s dismissal could not stand once the rationale shifted

The district court dismissed the APA claim on the understanding that Doe “failed to present any new evidence,” treating the denial of reconsideration as unreviewable on that basis. The Fifth Circuit held that approach effectively relied on a rationale not provided by the agency to the applicant—and, indeed, contradicted by the agency’s own written “not eligible” statement. Under Chenery and its progeny, that warranted reversal and remand.

4) Remedy: reversal and remand for further proceedings

The court did not decide the ultimate merits of Doe’s APA claim. It vacated the dismissal and remanded so that the case proceeds with the agency action judged on its stated ground (or for further agency explanation consistent with administrative-law requirements). The remedy reflects Chenery’s standard solution: the agency must supply the lawful, contemporaneous rationale in the record, not through later advocacy.

C. Impact

1) Litigation discipline for agencies: the record must match the defense

The decision reinforces in the Fifth Circuit that agencies cannot pivot in court from a threshold rationale (“ineligible”) to an alternative rationale (merits-based “no new evidence”) to avoid review or shore up a weak administrative explanation. For agency litigators, the case is a warning that the administrative decision letter and record must contain the grounds the government expects to defend.

2) Procedural regularity in reconsideration regimes

Although the opinion is brief, its reliance on the Guidebook’s mandatory-seeming description suggests heightened scrutiny when an agency’s reconsideration procedures are framed in “either/or” terms and the agency instead chooses a third option (ineligibility) without explanation. Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.

3) Administrative law, not NPDB merits, drives the holding

The ruling does not establish substantive standards for removing AARs or interpreting the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (“HCQIA”). Its precedential force lies in administrative law: courts in the Fifth Circuit will police explanation-shifting and require agencies to stand on what they said when they acted.

4) Interaction with pro se considerations (Judge Haynes’s view)

Judge Haynes would have affirmed the unappealed constitutional claims and preferred a limited remand to permit counsel-developed arguments to be aired first in the district court, invoking the deference owed to pro se litigants. Even though the majority did not adopt that procedural framing, the separate writing signals that, on remand, district courts may be receptive to fuller development where initial briefing was pro se—while still remaining bound by Chenery’s restriction on post hoc agency rationales.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): A federal statute that allows courts to review many final agency actions to ensure the agency acted lawfully and provided a reasoned explanation.

Final agency action: The agency’s definitive position (often a letter or decision) that marks the end of the administrative process and is typically what courts review.

Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.

Post hoc rationalization: A justification offered after the fact (in court) that is not found in the agency’s original decision.

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB): A federal repository that includes certain adverse reports about medical practitioners; hospitals and other entities consult it for credentialing and privileging decisions.

Adverse Action Report (AAR): A report submitted (here, by a hospital) reflecting an adverse professional action, potentially affecting a physician’s career opportunities.

Reconsideration vs. reopening: Agencies sometimes allow a party to ask the agency to revisit a prior decision; such requests often require “new evidence” or similar showings. The key in this case is that whatever the agency’s standard is, it must be the standard the agency states and applies in the record.
