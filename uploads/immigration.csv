[13] Table10 Fiscal Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule A rigorous public charge rule—built upon objective, measurable criteria such as education, age, English proficiency, and welfare use—would better select future immigrants to the U.S. and reduce uncertainty for applicants.","During President Donald Trump’s first term in office, his administration sought to strengthen the “public charge” requirement of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which aims to prevent the entry of immigrants who are likely to depend on government assistance. The reform, however, was blocked by legal challenges and ultimately withdrawn by the Biden administration.

More recently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance directing immigration adjudicators to make fuller use of their existing public charge authority, consistent with current regulations. This is a positive step. But the second Trump administration should go further by strengthening the public charge rule to provide a clearer and more legally sound framework that excludes more applicants likely to become public charges while simultaneously offering greater certainty to applicants.

This issue brief presents a reformed public charge rule based on a points system. This proposal would more effectively exclude immigrant applicants likely to become public charges, as intended by the INA. An effective public charge rule would benefit current citizens by increasing tax revenue and economic growth while reducing government spending on welfare. It would also benefit immigrants by providing greater certainty about their eligibility and by incentivizing them to learn English and pursue education to qualify to immigrate.

One of the first federal immigration restrictions was the Immigration Act of 1882’s ban on immigrants who were “unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.” In the Immigration Act of 1889, Congress excluded “paupers or persons likely to become a public charge.” For nearly 150 years—longer than any modern federal welfare or entitlement program has existed—U.S. immigration law has included some form of public charge exclusion. Congress recognized that, given the wealth of the U.S., many of the world’s poorest people would be better off as “paupers” in America than staying in their native countries.

The current form of the rule, found in the INA, provides that “any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”[1]

This statute applies to both temporary and permanent visitors, though it is applied differently in each case. For nonimmigrant visa applicants—excluding those applying for “dual-intent” visas, which allow for the possibility of permanent immigration—satisfying the public charge rule requires only demonstrating to the immigration officer that they intend to leave the country and will not become a public charge during their stay. For the most common visa of this category, the tourist visa, this means showing sufficient financial means for the trip and the return home without working illegally or relying on welfare or charity.

Public charge determinations are most relevant for evaluating permanent immigrants, who plan to remain in the U.S. through old age and thus present the greatest potential fiscal risks and benefits. Accordingly, this issue brief focuses on them.

The INA requires that the following factors be considered in determining whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge:

Age

Health

Family status

Assets, resources, and financial status

Education and skills

The law also allows the government to consider other characteristics that are not specified. However, an applicant deemed likely to become a public charge may still be admitted or allowed to remain if the applicant can submit an affidavit of support from someone who agrees to assume financial responsibility.

The current standard that is used to determine if a prospective immigrant is likely to become a public charge is based on a 1999 Interim Field Guidance issued during the Clinton administration.[2] That standard is not hard to meet: in 2017, approximately 1,000 immigrant visa petitions—out of well over one million—were rejected based on the public charge rule.[3] A number of those refusals may have rested on additional grounds and could subsequently be reversed in a later fiscal year if applicants established, in a new interview, that they were not likely to become public charges.

One reason that the rule is so rarely invoked is that, in making determinations, the government currently considers only whether an applicant has actually received government benefits in the past, but not whether they applied for them. Furthermore, adjudicators do not consider all forms of benefits in making their determinations, limiting their consideration to whether an applicant has received:

Supplemental Security Income (SSI)

Cash under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)

State, tribal, territorial, or local cash benefit programs

Institutionalized long-term care at government expense

The current approach to the public charge rule does not take into account whether applicants have ever received aid under any of the following welfare programs:

Medicaid

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

Subsidies and disability pay under Medicare or Social Security

Subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act

Housing vouchers, rent or utility subsidies, or residence in public housing

Tax credits for low-income individuals such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

Other refundable tax credits like the Child Tax Credit (CTC) or educational aid

Free school lunch

The Biden administration formalized this limited approach in a 2022 regulation that replaced the Trump administration’s overhaul attempt. The Biden-era regulation defines a public charge as one who is “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”[4] This is a higher bar to clear to become a public charge, because subsistence implies that the immigrant’s life would suffer or end without government aid—not that the immigrant is, on net, straining public finances. Therefore, immigrants who receive substantial welfare benefits without paying much, if any, in taxes would still not be considered public charges, even if their presence in America costs taxpayers thousands of dollars every year.

The Biden public charge rule also excludes consideration of future tax payments and thus does not allow a consular officer or immigration adjudicator to determine whether an immigrant is likely to become a net fiscal contributor or a net fiscal burden.

The current public charge regulations—which allow only for consideration of past receipt of a limited set of benefits—are out of step with the goal of the statute, which requires the government to weigh a host of factors to determine whether an immigrant is likely to become a public charge in the future. Of course, receipt of benefits, whether at the time of the application or in the past, should be part of the consideration. But the law and common sense allow many other factors to be considered.

The first Trump administration sought to strengthen the public charge rule through a regulation that would have expanded the number of programs considered to be public benefits, allowed adjudicators to consider whether an applicant had applied for benefits (as opposed to just receipt), and expanded the use of “bonds” to ensure that immigrants would pay back any benefits they may use.[5]

The Trump rule added consideration of the following welfare programs:

SNAP

Housing vouchers, rent or utility subsidies, and residence in public housing

Medicaid

Emergency medical care benefits

Free school lunch

Under the Trump rule, an applicant was “likely at any time to become a public charge” if it was “more likely than not” that the applicant would “receive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).”[6] Thus, under the rule, applicants should be rejected if the adjudicator determines that there is at least a 50% chance that the applicant will receive one welfare program for a year, or two welfare programs for 6 months, within a three-year period. The rule, however, was challenged by a coalition of blue states on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and was racially discriminatory. The courts delayed enforcement of the rule until Trump left office, and the Biden administration withdrew it.[7]

Although it was a step in the right direction, the Trump public charge rule reform suffered from a serious flaw: it did not provide adjudicators with sufficient clarity on how to evaluate demographic factors. In particular, the proposal offered no guidance on how much weight should be given to each of the factors. For example, does education matter more than age or age more than education? What about English proficiency?

These are the types of questions that a new public charge regulation can answer by creating a points system for public charge decisions. A points guide for immigration adjudicators would simplify implementation because decisions would be quicker and less arbitrary, which would also lessen the regulatory burden on both the government and immigrants.

In a previous report on the lifetime fiscal impact of immigrants,[8] I analyzed data on tax payments and benefit receipts across different immigrant groups. That report showed that immigrants without a high school diploma were more likely than not to become net burdens on the taxpayer, regardless of their age—and that elderly immigrants, regardless of education, were likely to become net public burdens. An improved public charge rule should therefore exclude all immigrants in these high-risk groups unless they can demonstrate—through factors such as English proficiency, stable employment prospects, or financially capable sponsors—that they differ meaningfully from the statistical norm.

The Trump administration should provide USCIS and consular officers with a rubric based on all of the factors that are required to be considered under the law, as well as English proficiency and past receipt of welfare benefits (Table 1). For immigrants who are applying for adjustment of status in the U.S. after living here for at least one year, the minimum score required would be 50 out of 100 possible points. For those applying for an immigrant visa who are outside the U.S. and have never lived in the U.S. other than on short-term tourist visits, the minimum score required would be 40 out of 80 possible points.

Table1

Points System Rubrics

Adjusting Status

Consular Processing

For each category, points would be awarded as follows:

Education (Up to 30 Points)

No high school diploma or equivalent (0)

High school diploma (10)

Some college education such as an associate’s degree (15)

Bachelor’s degree (25)

Professional or graduate degree (30)

Age (Up to 20 Points)

Under 21 years old (10)

21 to 39 years old (20)

40 to 49 years old (10)

50 to 59 years old (5)

60 years old and older (0)

English Proficiency (Up to 20 Points)

Applicants would have the option to take either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), which is more common among British English speakers. Immigrants with a bachelor-equivalent or higher degree from an English-speaking university in an English-speaking country would not be required to take the test and would receive the full 20 points.

TOEFL or IELTS score under the 20th percentile (0)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 20th and below the 40th percentile (5)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 40th and below the 60th percentile (10)

TOEFL or IELTS score between the 60th and below the 80th percentile (15)

TOEFL or IELTS score at or above the 80th percentile or a bachelor’s degree or equivalent or a higher degree from a U.S. university or a university in one of the following English-speaking countries (20):

United Kingdom

Ireland

Canada

Australia

New Zealand

Past Public Benefit Use (Up to 20 Points)

Currently receives any public benefits or has ever received public benefits for 12 months or longer (0)

Received public benefits for at least 6 months but less than 12 months (5)

Received public benefits for at least 3 months but less than 6 months (10)

Received public benefits for less than 3 months (15)

Never received any public benefits (20)

Health (Up to 5 Points)

Disabled (0)

Not disabled (5)

The regulation should list explicitly which conditions, such as blindness or deafness, would count as disabilities for purposes of the public charge determination. Disability is included as one factor not out of any animus, but to ensure that public resources remain available for current U.S. citizens with disabilities, rather than being spread across large numbers of immigrants with conditions that will strain public resources. In addition, this factor is not weighed very heavily, meaning that it will still be easy for someone with a disability to pass this public charge test as long as they have some education, speak English relatively well, and have some financial resources—or are willing to pay their immigration bond.

Financial Resources (Up to 5 Points)

Net household assets below $10,000 (0)

Net household assets of at least $10,000 (5)

The immigrant should submit tax returns, bank account statements, investment account statements, and other financial documents such as home-value estimates and a list of all debts to calculate his or her net assets.

The consideration of “family status,” which is required by law, would involve scoring each spouse in a married couple separately on this rubric and then averaging both scores.

Absent a showing of other extraordinary evidence, any score below the minimum would lead to a determination that the applicant is likely to become a public charge and is thus rendered inadmissible.

For a better understanding of how this system would work in practice, consider the following illustrative examples.

Married Adult Sibling of a U.S. Citizen (FB-4 Immigrant Visa)

In this case we have a 42-year-old Mexican man who is married to a 37-year-old Mexican woman. The man was sponsored for permanent residency by his U.S. citizen sibling under the FB-4 immigrant visa, and the couple has been waiting in Mexico for more than a decade for an FB-4 visa to become available. Since they are married, both spouses must be evaluated by the public charge rule points table, and their scores will be averaged to determine whether they meet the requirements.

The husband did not complete high school, while the wife has a high school diploma but no college education. Both received low scores on the TOEFL. Neither is disabled. Although neither has ever received U.S. public benefits, because they have only ever visited the U.S. briefly for tourism, they will be evaluated on the 80-point scale that disregards past public benefit.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 2.

Table2

Married Adult Sibling of a U.S. Citizen (FB-4 Immigrant Visa)

Husband (Principal Applicant)

Wife

Since their scores are 15 and 40, their average score is 27.5, below the 40-point threshold, thus making them inadmissible under the proposed public charge rule. Their visa would still be available, but they would have to reapply at the consulate after obtaining more education, saving more to meet the asset test, or learning more English. However, each year that they wait could subtract points from the age category.

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #1

This is the fastest-growing immigrant visa category because it is uncapped, so there is no waitlist. In this case we have a married couple from the Dominican Republic, aged 63 and 59, and who never lived in the United States.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 3.

Table3

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #1

Husband

Wife

Because both spouses score under 40 out of their 80-point scale, they would be deemed inadmissible under the public charge rule, and their application for permanent residency would be rejected.

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #2

This second hypothetical example of the same parent visa category involves well-educated parents of a high-skilled immigrant from India who is sponsoring them after becoming naturalized.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 4.

Table4

Parent of U.S. Citizen (IR-5 Immigrant Visa): Example #2

Husband

Wife

The average of their scores is exactly 40 points out of 80, so they can obtain their visa and live in the United States.

Employment-Based Immigrant (EB-2 Immigrant Visa)

In this case we have a German man who has spent years in the U.S. on an H1-B visa sponsored by a major bank and has now been sponsored for permanent residency. He is married to an Italian immigrant whom he met while they were both international students in the United States.

The couple would be scored as shown in Table 5.

Table5

Employment-Based Immigrant (EB-2 Immigrant Visa)

Husband

Wife

They both have very high scores and are thus admissible and can receive their visa. This will be the result for almost every single employment-based visa application, but not for family visa applications.

The INA allows the government to require immigrant applicants to post a bond in order to receive a visa, but in practice this requirement is rarely if ever imposed.[9] The Trump administration, however, has recently begun using this authority to deter visa overstays for tourists from a few African countries with high visa overstay rates.[10] The proposed reform in President Trump’s first term also sought to increase the use of immigration bonds in the public charge context. Under that proposal, applicants who could not satisfy the public charge standard could still be admitted if they posted a bond, but the bond—which is normally refundable after naturalization or permanent departure—would instead be retained permanently, thus effectively creating a fee for immigrants likely to become public charges.[11]

A public charge bond is preferable to an outright public charge exclusion because it gives applicants who would otherwise be rejected the chance to immigrate to the U.S., but only if they can cover the costs of likely future public benefit use. The 2019 reform proposal set these public charge bonds at $8,100, or about $10,000 in today’s dollars.[12] A better option would tie the bond amount to the applicant’s score under the points system: for those assessed on the 100-point scale, the bond would equal $1,000 per point below the threshold; for those on the 80-point scale, $1,250 per point. If an immigrant later violates the public charge rule—for example, by receiving public benefits as a green card holder—the bond would be forfeited and the revenue directed to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction.

For instance, if an immigrant’s public charge score is 30 out of 80—10 points below the 40-point threshold for admission—he can post a $10,000 bond to overcome it. If he is married or has a child, then the amount would be $20,000.

By increasing the costs of immigration, public charge bonds would ensure that more visas go to wealthier and more educated applicants and that fewer go to potential public charges. These bonds would simultaneously reduce the deficit by allowing the Treasury to accrue interest on potentially billions of dollars in immigration bonds.

A stronger public charge rule would have two effects on the immigrant flow: it would encourage immigrants to obtain more education and learn more English, and it would shift visa allocation to more educated and younger applicants both within and across visa categories. For example, because negative public charge determinations would overwhelmingly occur among family visa applicants, it is likely that many of those visas would go unused and thus that more visas would shift to the employment-based category as the law mandates. Additionally, within the family-based visa categories, more educated and younger applicants would have the opportunity to come to the U.S. ahead of earlier applicants who were rejected on public charge grounds. Both effects would result in a more highly skilled immigrant flow and thus a reduced budget deficit.

To estimate how many immigrants would fail to meet the public charge rule test—and the resulting effects on visa allocation—Table 6 analyzes American Community Survey (ACS) data on noncitizens who arrived within the last five years who were at least 18 years old at the time of arrival. Among such immigrants, those who fall into one of three demographic groups are unlikely to qualify under the new public charge proposal: those who lack a high school diploma, unless they are between ages 21 and 39; those who lack a bachelor’s degree and are age 60 or older; and those under 60 years old with either a high school diploma or some college education but bad English proficiency. Under this proposal, 32.2% of recent immigrants fall into one of these three groups and thus would likely be disqualified.

Table 6

Share of Recent Immigrants Likely to Be Excluded Under Points-Based Public Charge Rule

Some may object that this estimate—because it includes all noncitizens who responded to the ACS—may include a large number of illegal immigrants. To ease these concerns, I repeated the same test with the 2019 ACS, which predates the border crisis and thus has fewer illegal immigrant respondents. I also repeated the test with the 2023 ACS sample but limited the analysis to non-Mexican and non–Central American respondents who arrived in the last five years, since the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are from either Mexico or Central America.

The 2019 ACS data, presented in Table 7 suggest that 27.9% of recent arrivals would fall into one of the three groups likely to be inadmissible—lower than the estimate based on 2023 data but still very high.

Table7

2019 ACS Inadmissibility Estimates

Using the non-Mexican and non–Central American (Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan) 2019 ACS sample, we get an even lower share of likely inadmissible immigrants: 24.2%, nearly one in four (Table 8).

Table8

Non-Mexican and Non–Central American Inadmissibility Estimates

The true inadmissibility rate will probably lie between 24% and 32%, given that legal immigrants tend to be older than those who are in the U.S. illegally. Excluding Mexicans and Central Americans reduces the share of legal immigrants in the sample who are sponsored by family members as well. In other words, we can reasonably expect that if we had a true sample with English ability, education, and age of all legal permanent resident applicants, approximately one in four would be denied or have to post a bond on the basis of this proposed public charge rule.

In estimating the effect of this proposal on greed card issuance, I assumed a lowerest estimated share of visas among the previous estimates that would be affected, since some applicants are exempt from the public charge rule (refugees and asylees). I also assumed that all applicants age 60 or older were parents of U.S. citizens and that all the diversity visa applicants had a high school diploma, as is required by law. Using the pre-pandemic fiscal-year 2019 immigrant visa issuances as a baseline, that means approximately 201,000 visas would be affected. Table 9 shows the impact for each visa category.

Table9

Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule on Different Visa Categories

As noted above, anyone excluded under the new public charge rule would have the option of posting a bond to be admitted. If the average bond is only $10,000 and all affected visa applicants pay it, this policy would raise $2 billion annually in bonds. And if only 10% of applicants violate the public charge rule later on and forfeit their bond, the result is a net deficit reduction of $200 million annually plus the interest on these bonds—approximately $80 million at a 4% long-term U.S. Treasury bond rate—for a total deficit reduction of more than $3 billion over a 10-year period.

But the greatest fiscal gains from this policy would be the result not of the bonds that the immigrants pay but the changes in selection of who immigrates. Many visas that are not issued in the extended family categories because of this proposed rule would instead carry over to the employment-based category. The other large gains would come from reducing the number of visas granted to parents of U.S. citizens, who often represent a large fiscal drag due to their collection of Social Security and Medicare shortly after arriving. Many in this category would either not be able to pay the required bond or would forfeit it upon receipt of those benefits.

For illustrative purposes, Table 10 shows the potential fiscal impact of this new system. I assumed that the public charge rule would be implemented as proposed in this issue brief, with an average bond amount of $10,000, half of the applicants in each category paying the bond, and 1 in 10 of bond payers forfeiting it through noncompliance. In that scenario, this proposal would raise $11.8 billion over 10 years, primarily via the increase in employment-based immigration. It would then raise more than $1 trillion over 30 years, from both the increase in employment-based immigration and a reduction in the number of elderly parents of U.S. citizens collecting Social Security and Medicare. These calculations are based on my report on the fiscal impact of immigration using Congressional Budget Office scoring.[13]

Table10

Fiscal Impact of Points-Based Public Charge Rule

A rigorous public charge rule—built upon objective, measurable criteria such as education, age, English proficiency, and welfare use—would better select future immigrants to the U.S. and reduce uncertainty for applicants. By aligning the allocation of green cards with immigrants’ likely fiscal contributions, this rule could reduce the federal deficit by billions every single year, promote greater self-sufficiency, grow the economy, and ensure that limited visa spots are directed to those who are most prepared to thrive and assimilate in the United States. While more applicants would be deemed inadmissible, the option of public charge bonds would create a fair and flexible pathway for them to immigrate regardless, and the clear expectations of a points-based system would encourage applicants to seek more education and learn English. The Trump administration should move quickly to implement this proposal so that any delays due to lawsuits would not prevent its implementation.

In issuing the two-week temporary restraining order in the case, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman wrote detainees at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center “have suffered, and are likely to suffer, irreparable harm” absent his order.

Among other demands, the judge is requiring officials at the ICE facility to provide detainees with a clean bedding mat “with sufficient space to sleep”; adequate supplies of soap, toilet paper, towels, oral hygiene and menstrual products; a shower for at least every other day; three full meals with water per day; and prescribed medication. Holding cells must be cleaned twice per day.

The order also requires detainees be ensured communication with attorneys in privacy, a list of attorneys available for hire and access to a phone. The feds also will be required to enter each detainee into an ICE online detainee locator system.

The order comes a day after the court heard more than three hours of testimony alleging that people were crammed 100 at a time into a holding cell without a hot meal, with nowhere to sleep but a dirty floor near an open toilet. Gettleman said Wednesday that he found the witness testimonies to be “highly credible.”

“People shouldn’t be sleeping in plastic chairs. They shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor,” Gettleman said.

A plaintiffs’ request to inspect the facility was not granted in the order.

In the lawsuit, former detainees at the center described sleeping on cold floors, poor sanitation and clogged toilets that sit in the middle of holding cells with no privacy. Lawyers called it “a breeding ground for illness to spread.”

The class-action lawsuit was filed last week by the MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU. It alleges that “Broadview is a black hole, and federal officials are acting with impunity inside its walls.”

Government lawyers have recently said the Broadview facility is “not equipped to be an overnight facility.” But the Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ have since documented how it has been holding people for multiple days at a time.

Gettleman said he tried to word the order in a manner “that honors the discretionary functions of running an institution like this and making it as workable as possible.”

He said the order will not go into effect immediately, noting, “I wouldn’t expect it to be at the snap of a finger.” Gettleman told the government lawyers to provide him an update by noon Friday on the status of the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to comply with the order.

Also Wednesday, plaintiffs’ lawyers said they’re looking for more information that will give them a better understanding of the space inside the detention facility. That includes video footage from inside the building, a list of detainees sent there, the documentation shared with detainees upon their arrival and policies governing the facility.

Vera employed a two-way fixed effects regression to understand how time after an election affects anti-immigrant attitudes.
“This also implies anti-immigrant attitudes are malleable.
“Our findings are important because there is a lot of xenophobic violence and hate crimes against immigrants,” Vera said.
Maybe there might be some possibilities to implement interventions to mitigate anti-immigrant sentiment during electoral periods.”","LAWRENCE — Immigration remains one of society’s most polarizing issues.

A new study examines how this issue affects voters during and after an election. While the results are tied to partisan viewpoints, they are less predictable than one might think.

“A strong polarization regarding immigration occurs closer to an election. But once we move away from an election, both sides begin to converge in the middle,” said Sofia Vera, assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas.

Her article titled “Democratic elections and anti-immigration attitudes” finds that right-wing respondents exhibit more negative attitudes toward immigrants when the election cycle is in full swing, but those negative views decrease once the election is over. The research also found that left-wing respondents express lower levels of xenophobia immediately after the election, but their immigration views become more negative as time after the election increases.

Vera's work appears in the Journal of Peace Research.

“Immigration plays such an important role in the way people decide their vote,” said Vera, who co-wrote the article with Miguel Carreras of the University of California, Riverside, and Giancarlo Visconti of the University of Maryland.

“In the U.S., Europe and Latin America, many political parties are adopting very negative stances toward immigration. They want to restrict it. People are worried immigrants are going to steal their jobs or threaten the national identity. And many far-right parties are adopting extreme views, painting immigrants as a threat and basically scapegoating immigrants for their national problems.”

Vera assumed the anti-immigration rhetoric espoused during elections might be homogeneous, with most voters becoming more xenophobic due to the disapproving rhetoric. But her study found that voters move in different directions depending on where they stand ideologically.

“Right-wing voters close to elections hold the most anti-immigrant attitudes, and as time from the election elapses, their attitudes become a bit less anti-immigrant. But we also find something we weren’t expecting: We also see a movement with left-wing voters. Closer to elections, they are adopting very strongly pro-immigration attitudes. And the more time passes after elections, their attitudes revert to what they were prior,” she said.

The immigration viewpoints of centrist voters appear unmoved by such political dynamics during elections, she said.

To gather this information, her team used data from Module 5 of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), a survey conducted between 2016 and 2021 in 45 different countries. The core objective of the CSES is to measure people’s stances and preferences toward representative democracy at the time of a national election. Vera employed a two-way fixed effects regression to understand how time after an election affects anti-immigrant attitudes.

One of the byproducts of Vera’s research is discovering how genuinely effective campaign messaging is in influencing voters regarding hot-button issues.

“We show that campaign rhetoric and elite rhetoric is shaping public opinion,” she said. “This also implies anti-immigrant attitudes are malleable. They can change and shift, and they do, especially around election time when this rhetoric and discourse is much stronger and more frequent.”

A KU faculty member since 2020, Vera focuses her research on political behavior in comparative perspective, as well as partisan elections and representation.

As an immigrant from Peru, Vera said she has not personally felt targeted by anti-immigration views.

“That has not affected me directly, not personally,” she said. “I’ve heard many stories from immigrant friends that they have been insulted or even mistreated. It hasn’t happened to me. But that doesn’t mean I’m less worried about the topic.”

Ultimately, she said she hoped this research could highlight the role — and responsibility — that political elites play during an election cycle.

“Our findings are important because there is a lot of xenophobic violence and hate crimes against immigrants,” Vera said. “And anti-immigrant speech can be a precursor to xenophobic violence. Maybe there might be some possibilities to implement interventions to mitigate anti-immigrant sentiment during electoral periods.”",https://news-archive-assets.ku.edu/data/e3/d7/01k9assv64ykvvw9dgejgx4cra.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 09:56:55.158596

The agreement became an issue during a ""zero-tolerance"" policy enforced at the border to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing illegally.
Officials said children couldn't be in criminal custody with their parents, and were limited in how long they could detain families because of the agreement.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which manages unaccompanied children crossing illegally, has not yet formally requested space for the minors, which it must do in order to set up the use.
Immigrant advocates have opposed any effort to detain children longer than the agreement allows.","The Trump administration said Thursday it plans to circumvent a longstanding court agreement that governs how children are treated in immigration custody, in part to detain families longer as a way to deter migrants from crossing the Southwestern border illegally.

The Homeland Security Department announced proposed regulations that would terminate the so-called Flores agreement that requires the government to keep children in the least-restricted setting and required their release generally after 20 days in detention.

The 1997 case that spawned the agreement will almost certainly land back in court. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Gee rejected a request by administration lawyers this summer to allow for longer family detention.

The agreement became an issue during a ""zero-tolerance"" policy enforced at the border to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing illegally.

More than 2,900 children were separated from their parents, prompting international outrage and scathing criticism over what many said was inhumane treatment of migrants. Officials said children couldn't be in criminal custody with their parents, and were limited in how long they could detain families because of the agreement.

The government currently has three operational family detention centers, but most are at capacity.

However, Homeland Security asked for space to house 12,000 beds for families, plus space to house 20,000 unaccompanied minors. That process is moving forward; the Defense Department has completed legal and environmental requirements needed but they're still working on the legal framework for the use of Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas for immigrant families. The Department of Health and Human Services, which manages unaccompanied children crossing illegally, has not yet formally requested space for the minors, which it must do in order to set up the use.

The rules proposed Thursday would allow the government to hold families until their immigration cases were completed, a move that government officials contend makes cases go much faster than if families are released.

""Today, legal loopholes significantly hinder the department's ability to appropriately detain and promptly remove family units that have no legal basis to remain in the country,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. ""This rule addresses one of the primary pull factors for illegal immigration and allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress.""

Perhaps the most visible one has been his effort to deport millions of people living in the country without permission.

The Trump administration has sent masked federal agents around the country to conduct raids in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, targeting workplaces, courthouses, neighborhoods and homes. The sweeps have entangled beloved community members, undocumented parents with American-born children, and even U.S. citizens. Latinos have often been the target of these raids, and many, regardless of their immigration status, are afraid to leave their homes or go to work.

A recent poll of registered voters shows that the public appears to be wrestling with such tactics. While voters largely support the idea of removing immigrants who have arrived in the country illegally, a majority believes that the Trump administration’s methods have gone too far.

We know that the deportations may also be affecting your students, their families and their communities.

How can you help your students make sense of what is happening and how it may be affecting them, their classmates and the country?

In this teaching resource, we’ve organized articles, essays, graphs, podcasts and first-person articles from across The New York Times into five sections that help students:

Understand the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

Put this moment into historical context.

See how the deportations are affecting individuals and communities.

Examine the public’s response.

Formulate their own opinions.

You might bring just one of these topics into your curriculum, or weave several of them together to create a mini unit. We suggest using a jigsaw or a stations activity to help students explore the many pieces we’ve gathered.

The fine schedule includes a $500 penalty for “obstructing the usual use, enjoyment or access to federal property.” In Chicago, several people — including Democratic U.S. House candidate Kat Abughazaleh — have already been accused of federal crimes for allegedly blocking vehicles outside a federal immigration facility.
In Portland, protesters have taken to wearing inflatable costumes and other outlandish outfits outside of the city’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement building.
They were drafted during the Biden administration by the General Services Administration, which operates federal buildings, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, which coordinates security.
Until now, federal citations have been filed almost entirely for actions on federal property, leading to unusual standoffs in Portland and other places where protests have taken place directly adjacent to the federal property line.","As masked and costumed protesters demonstrate outside federal immigration facilities nationwide, the federal government has sped up the start of a new rule that may expose those protesters to fines and additional penalties.

Under the new rule, which took effect Wednesday, those fines can apply to people who commit crimes near federal property as well as on it, giving the Department of Homeland Security what it calls “enhanced charging authority.”

The agency said the intent of the change is “to address violations occurring both on and off property to the extent it affects federal property and the persons thereon.”

The rule had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, a member of the local U.S. Attorney’s office requested a court order to implement a new list of fines for minor offenses under the rule.

In a court filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Beausang wrote: “The United States Attorney’s Office was informed today that the effective date of the regulations … may be advanced to November 5, 2025.”

Federal officials said there will be similar filings in other courts across the country during the coming days and weeks as the federal government implements the rule, which was proposed in the final days of the Biden administration and finalized in June under the Trump administration.

After an inquiry by the Alaska Beacon on Tuesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security issued a news release saying that the accelerated timeline is intended “to address a recent surge in security and public safety threats.”

“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the news release. “We’ve seen rampant violence against law enforcement including our officers shot at, rammed by vehicles, assaulted and threatened.”

Some of the items on the list of fines are simple updates of the current list, which was enacted in 2014.

There are new additions as well.

The fine schedule includes a $500 penalty for “obstructing the usual use, enjoyment or access to federal property.”

In Chicago, several people — including Democratic U.S. House candidate Kat Abughazaleh — have already been accused of federal crimes for allegedly blocking vehicles outside a federal immigration facility.

In Portland, protesters have taken to wearing inflatable costumes and other outlandish outfits outside of the city’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The new fine schedule calls for a $200 penalty for “wearing a mask, hood, disguise or device that conceals the identity of the wearer when attempting to avoid detection or identification while violating any federal, state or local law, ordinance or regulation.”

While implementation of the new fines was sped up since the start of protests outside immigration facilities this year, the new proposal was actually written before those protests began.

They were drafted during the Biden administration by the General Services Administration, which operates federal buildings, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, which coordinates security.

In the January notice that proposed the new fines, the agencies said that DHS will “more effectively effectuate crowd management by citing and releasing criminal actors rather than requiring an arrest and detention.”

The new fines cover “approximately 8,500 federal facilities,” according to the Federal Register notice, and — in another change from prior practice — apply “to criminal misconduct that occurs on the federal property and adjacent off-property misconduct that … affects, threatens, or endangers the federal property and its occupants.”

That may have significant implications for the current immigration-facility protests.

Until now, federal citations have been filed almost entirely for actions on federal property, leading to unusual standoffs in Portland and other places where protests have taken place directly adjacent to the federal property line.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigrationdetention-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 11:04:04.401492

Two ICE agents flanked the teacher Wednesday inside Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center and then forced her outside through the doors with her arms behind her back.
A DHS spokesperson disputed the narrative that Galeano was chased inside the day care center.

Two ICE agents flanked the teacher Wednesday inside Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center and then forced her outside through the doors with her arms behind her back.

“This morning ICE agents followed a teacher into the facility without a warrant and abducted her in front of her students,” Rep. Mike Quigley said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon, adding the incident showed a “complete lack of humanity.”

The day care teacher’s arrest marks the latest action by federal immigration authorities to draw condemnation in the Chicago area, which has seen a series of aggressive tactics since the Department of Homeland Security launched “Operation Midway Blitz” at the beginning of September as part of President Donald Trump’s nationwide enforcement agenda.

The arrest happened “during the busiest time of drop-off where kids and families have to witness a teacher being forcibly removed and agents kitted up in tactical gear,” Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old son is taught by the woman, told the Associated Press.

“These are the nicest, kindest people. They don’t deserve, these children don’t deserve to be living through this,” Esmeralda Rosales, whose child attends the daycare, told the AP.

Rayito de Sol, which translates to Little Ray of Sunshine, offers services for infants through pre-kindergarten-aged children, with several locations throughout the Chicago and Minneapolis areas, according to the company’s website.

CNN has reached out to a representative for the teacher.

Quigley, a Democrat, said the teacher, identified by DHS, as Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano, was a trusted and beloved member of the community, insisting she has a work permit.

A DHS spokesperson disputed the narrative that Galeano was chased inside the day care center.

“Officers attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop of this female illegal alien from Colombia,” Tricia McLaughlin wrote in In a long post on X.

Officers attempted to pull over a vehicle registered to Galeano with sirens and emergency lights, “but the male driver refused to pull the vehicle over,” the post continued.

“Law enforcement pursued the vehicle before the assailant sped into a shopping plaza where he and the female passenger fled the vehicle. They ran into a daycare and attempted to barricade themselves inside the daycare—recklessly endangering the children inside.”

“The illegal alien female was arrested inside a vestibule, not in the school. Upon arrest, she lied about her identity. The vehicle is registered to in her name, though she claims that she didn’t know the man who was driving her car and just picked him up from a bus stop,” McLaughlin added.

Galeano entered the US illegally after crossing the southern border in 2023, DHS said in a separate statement, noting having a work authorization “does NOT confer any type of legal status to be in the US.”

Maria Guzman, a day care representative and parent at Rayito de Sol, called the arrest an act of “domestic terrorism.”

“This is horrific. They have crossed a line,” Guzman said.

Rep. Delia Ramirez said she talked to teachers who were hiding inside the day care center, worried they were going to die.

“What happened today is despicable,” Ramirez said during the news conference.

Ramirez, a Democrat, is a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and said she will work with her colleagues to launch a federal review of the arrest.

“We need to make sure that people understand that these businesses have rights and we are going to do everything we can to help them uphold those rights. Those agents not just rushed in, they went into other rooms,” Ramirez said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2244762965.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-06 07:56:21.340574

""I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,"" Trump said at a breakfast with Republican senators Wednesday. ""And they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor, but I don't know about that.""

Democrats won in races up and down the ballot and across the country with a message focused on affordability and opposing Trump administration policies – including the yearlong push to fire federal workers, slash spending and punish people who oppose the president.

Congressional leaders have so far failed to negotiate or move with urgency to end the shutdown, even as millions of Americans face the loss of federal food aid and rising federal health insurance premiums, and many government employees work without pay.

The president has consistently framed the appropriations lapse as something Democrats have caused and only Democrats can solve, but the election results cap a shift in tone that suggests a resolution could come sooner – and with his approval.

Here are four ways Tuesday's results could influence the length of the government shutdown:

Voters unhappy with the Republican Party's governance put pressure on Trump

One of the biggest rebukes of Trump administration policies came in Virginia, home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors.

Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race there by 15 points with a message that argued Trump's push to fire federal workers and slash federal spending — and later, the ongoing government shutdown — harmed the state's economy.

In New Jersey, the Trump administration's announcement threatening to terminate funding for the major Gateway Tunnel rail project between Newark and New York City loomed large over the final days of the election. Democrat Mikie Sherrill bested Trump-backed Jack Ciattarelli in the governor's race by a similar margin to Spanberger's.

The Democratic Party is also touting upsets in two Georgia statewide utility regulator contests, the retention of state Supreme Court judges in Pennsylvania and a slew of flipped municipal elections as evidence its message as the party that is better for economic and public safety policies is resonating.

Democrats keep holding out, emboldened by the election

Tuesday's election has Democrats feeling good about how they are responding to Republican governance, which could lead to a continuation of the shutdown.

Democrats want the Republican-led Congress to prevent insurance premium subsidies from expiring at the end of the year for millions of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act health plans. If Republicans agree to that, Democrats say they would then vote to fund the government so it can reopen.

Researchers estimate the average cost of insurance purchased through the health insurance marketplace would double and millions would become uninsured without the subsidies.

At several points during the shutdown, the White House has taken steps to try to target Democrats and force them to drop their demands, like cutting grant funding for programs the Biden administration supported, seeking to lay off workers and reversing guidance that would keep SNAP benefits going through the funding lapse.

After the election, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the president demanding he negotiate with them to reopen the government.

""We write to demand a bipartisan meeting of legislative leaders to end the GOP shutdown of the federal government and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,"" the letter reads. ""Democrats stand ready to meet with you face to face, anytime and any place.""

The note ends with Trump's signature line: ""Thank you for your attention to this matter.""

The president once again accused Democrats of holding the country ""hostage"" over the shutdown in remarks at a business forum Wednesday afternoon.

Trump keeps pushing for an end to the filibuster

The president has declined to negotiate with Democrats and has doubled down on his belief that Senate Republicans should eliminate the legislative filibuster that maintains a higher vote threshold for some legislation to pass through the upper chamber.

""It's time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that's terminate the filibuster,"" Trump reiterated at Wednesday's Republican breakfast. ""It's the only way you can do it. And if you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that ending the filibuster is a non-starter. Senate Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to using what's called the ""nuclear option"" of abolishing the filibuster, warning that Democratic control of Congress in the future could see the passage of sweeping legislation.

Time runs out to pass an existing funding fix

The House passed a temporary spending plan at the end of September without any Democratic voters but Senate approval requires seven Democrats or independents to join with the Republican majority. The continuing resolution has an expiration date of Nov. 21, though.

That means the House, which has been out of session for more than 40 days, will have to come up with a new plan to reopen the government and resume work on bills to fund different parts of the government for the full fiscal year — and get the Senate to agree.

In the meantime, more essential services the government provides run the risk of running out of money, seeing staffing shortages and encountering other problems due to the lapse in funding.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5616x3159+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Fab%2F66d1e24248d49ffed259ec36b07b%2Fgettyimages-2244638567.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 08:17:06.880053

The Commission hopes this judgment will put a stop on the continual intimidation and harassment of non-nationals and undocumented persons by Operation Dudula and other related groups.
The Commission once again call on the state authorities to do their work of restoring law and order and ensuring constitutional rights are upheld.","The Court recognised the SAHRC’s pivotal role as a constitutional body mandated to promote, protect, and monitor human rights. Although cited as the thirteenth respondent, the SAHRC asked to present evidence and submissions supporting a rights-based interpretation of section 41 of the Immigration Act. Section 41 of the Immigration Act states that when so requested by an immigration officer or a police member, any person shall identify himself or herself as a citizen, permanent resident or foreigner, and if such person is a foreigner, he or she shall on demand produce an ascertainable valid passport and visa, or permit, and the other required documents referred to in this Act.

If such person fails to produce the required documents immediately, he or she may be detained by an immigration officer or a police member for a period not exceeding 48 hours, or for such longer period as may be reasonably necessary and justifiable, in order to verify his or her identity or status, and if it is established that such person is an illegal foreigner, he or she may be dealt with in accordance with this Act. No person may be refused entry, removed or deported unless such person has been properly identified as an illegal foreigner, and all verification and other relevant procedures have been followed. Any detention under this section shall be in compliance with the Constitution and with this Act and shall not be for longer than the time strictly necessary to verify the person's identity or status.

The SAHRC advanced the principle that the enforcement of immigration laws must comply with constitutional guarantees and international human rights obligations, particularly the rights to dignity, privacy, freedom, and the best interests of the child. The SAHRC submitted evidence before the Court of a fifteen-year-old South African child who was arrested in Johannesburg and detained with adults, by SAPS, after she failed to produce identity documents. This experience, initially brought to the Commission as a complaint, highlighted the challenges with the broad discretion exercised by SAPS.

The Court agreed in part, declaring that section 41,authorises warrantless searches only in public places, not in private homes, workplaces, schools, or other private premises; requires that an immigration or police officer must hold a reasonable suspicion that a person is unlawfully in the country before demanding identification; and must be interpreted to protect the rights and best interests of children, in accordance with section 28 of the Constitution. These interpretive declarations effectively read constitutional safeguards into section 41, narrowing its scope anlimiting potential misuse.

The Court also ordered that Operation Dudula, Zandile Dabula and its office bearers must stop demanding that any private person produce her / his passport or other identity documents to demonstrate her / his right to be in the Republic, and to stop intimidating, harassing and/or assaulting any individuals that they identify as being non-nationals. Operation Dudula was further interdicted from making public statements that constitute hate speech on the grounds of nationality, social origin or ethnicity at public gatherings, on social media platforms or in any other way. Operation Dudula was interdicted from interfering with the access of non-nationals to health care services, interfering with access to schools and intimidating or harassing learners, teachers or parents at schools.

Operation Dudula was also ordered to stop the unlawfully evicting non-nationals from their homes; unlawfully removing foreign nationals from their trading stalls or interfering with the employment of foreign nationals in shops and businesses. The South African Government has been ordered to take reasonable steps to implement the National Action Plan to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. The Commission hopes this judgment will put a stop on the continual intimidation and harassment of non-nationals and undocumented persons by Operation Dudula and other related groups. The Commission once again call on the state authorities to do their work of restoring law and order and ensuring constitutional rights are upheld.

As earlier as 02 July 2025, the Commission has publicly emphasised that the actions of these vigilante groups are unlawful, violate constitutional rights and undermine the rule of law. The Commission will monitor the implementation of this judgment and look forward to the enrolment of its case in High Court in Durban against these vigilante groups and its leaders.

Federal agents from the FBI, ATF, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using flash bang grenades and battering rams, trampled through the apartments.
Her home was wrongly raided by heavily armed federal agents, with the FBI.
But there have been roadblocks and restrictions due to differing interpretations of the law when it comes to immunity for federal agents.
CBS News Chicago investigators are digging into other claims and lawsuits alleging abuses by federal agents in the Chicago area.","For months, claims of abuse and wrongful arrest have been levied against ffederal immigration agents in Chicagos. But what options do people really have to hold federal agents accountable? One case in Georgia could lead to a wave of lawsuits in Chicago.

Historically, it's been extremely difficult to sue the federal government if you believe your rights were violated. But now that could change because of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision.

The federal raid on the 130-unit apartment building at 75th and South Shore in September has led to a congressional investigation by the Homeland Security and judiciary committees.

""They had little children and old people outside and in handcuffs,"" said Patrick Jaicomo, attorney for the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit that provides legal support for people accusing the federal government of abusing constitutional rights.

Federal agents from the FBI, ATF, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using flash bang grenades and battering rams, trampled through the apartments. In an Oct. 6 letter to Homeland Security director Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pamela Bondi, ranking democrats accused ICE agents of violence against innocent people, including children swept up and taken away wearing little clothing. Cell phone video captured one child wrapped in a blanket.

""Just imagine the sort of traumatic experience that it is to have your door blown open in the middle of the night or in the very early morning. and now imagine that you're four or five years old, you can't even really process what's going on, even in the aftermath,"" Jaicomo said. ""If you were harmed by a federal officer, you can do something about that now.""

Jaicomo is expecting a tidal wave of lawsuits nationwide against federal agents, not just for raids like what happened in South Shore, but also lawsuits filed by U.S. citizens and non-citizens in communities impacted the most by federal agents over the last several months, for allegations of excessive force, wrongful arrest, wrongful detention, and other injuries.

What's making this all possible? Jaicomo points to a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision about another federal raid in Georgia in 2017. The case at the center is his client, Trina Martin, and part of what happened at her home that was captured on a police body camera.

""I still see the moment, and I still see what it has done to my son,"" she said.

Her home was wrongly raided by heavily armed federal agents, with the FBI.

""They forced their way into my home about four o'clock in the morning. Threw in flash, bang, grenade, bombs, had us all surrounded with assault rifles in our face. My son was in a room by himself with just looking into a barrel of a gun, and I can hear him calling me,"" she said.

Her son Gabe was only 7 years old at the time.

""I could just hear my son calling my name, just ma, ma, ma, and this, that sound will always stay with me,"" she said.

The agents weren't even on the right street. The federal agent in charge said his GPS device sent him to the wrong house. And even though they raided the wrong home, attorneys representing the FBI in court argued the feds were immune from being sued.

""In the Martin's case, these officers and the United States really were completely immunized from any sort of accountability or liability for the harms that they created,"" Jaicomo said.

People who believe they've been harmed by federal employees can sue under what's called the Federal Tort Claims Act. But there have been roadblocks and restrictions due to differing interpretations of the law when it comes to immunity for federal agents. That's what happened in Trina's case, and it was initially thrown out.

""So, it's really hard to sue the federal government for several reasons. The first is that the federal government is the government, so when you're asking to sue it in its own courts, it can make that as hard as possible,"" Jaicomo said.

So then Jaicomo and Martin appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in June, eight years after the wrong raid on her home, justices made this landmark decision unanimously, agreeing that the federal government did not have immunity, and her case could move forward because she did have the right to sue.

""All of these ICE raids and other DHS actions will result in the federal government paying tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in damages,"" Jaicomo said.

""I feel like people have an opportunity to hold the federal government accountable for their actions,"" Martin said.

The lawsuit filed by the Martin family is expected to go back to court later this year.

The Trump administration is firing scores of immigration judges and bringing on dozens of others. These judges inside the executive branch are often immigrants' last chance to argue why they should stay in the U.S. NPR's Ximena Bustillo and Anusha Mathur have found a pattern in the backgrounds of 70 judges who have been fired. The largest share have experience representing immigrants.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: The story told is often the same. It started out as a dream job.

TANIA NEMER: It was something that, like, I was essentially, like, born to do.

BUSTILLO: Tania Nemer was selected to be an immigration judge in Cleveland.

NEMER: I feel like as the middle child, I was always kind of just put in that situation between siblings and parents and cousins. And I always just loved listening and asking questions and understanding their perspective. And then, if I had a basis to solve the problem, I loved to do that.

BUSTILLO: That's why she loved her job as an immigration judge. But that dream came to an end one day in February, while she was in the middle of a hearing.

NEMER: I had about, you know, 30 or 40 immigrants in my courtroom. I had DHS. I had court staff. I was on the bench, on the record. I had just finished explaining all to the group, like, their rights and responsibilities.

BUSTILLO: Then her supervisor took her aside and Nemer was informed that she was terminated, but not given a reason. She was escorted out of the building. Nemer was among the very first immigration judges to be terminated. Immigration judges are civil servants in the Justice Department, one of the agencies that has seen restructuring in the federal workforce. And since, that scene has played out in courtrooms across the country.

KYRA LILIEN: I think being a judge is sort of a goal, a career goal that a lot of immigration attorneys have.

BUSTILLO: That's Kyra Lilien. She was an immigration judge in Northern California, and she got her email in the middle of an asylum hearing.

LILIEN: The interpreter who was in the courtroom with me, he had been in many hearings with me, and he just started crying, and he said, I can't believe this is happening.

BUSTILLO: She was also never given a reason. Anam Petit was an immigration judge in Virginia also fired during a hearing.

ANAM PETIT: No one has told me why I was let go, you know? So this is all speculative. It has to be because no one has had that conversation with me.

BUSTILLO: NPR has independently identified 70 judges fired by the Trump administration. An analysis of their professional backgrounds show that those who have prior background in immigrant defense make up the largest share of those fired. Out of those onboarded in the last two years, those who have some experience working for the Department of Homeland Security make up the largest share of those still on the bench. Dozens have confirmed to NPR that they were not given a reason for their firings. Several judges have wondered if their own experience defending immigrants was a reason. Here's Lilien, the judge in California.

LILIEN: Anyone who ever represented a noncitizen at any point in their lives - whether they also worked for DHS, whether they worked for ICE - that seems to be the indelible stain that got them fired.

BUSTILLO: The Justice Department said it doesn't, quote, ""target or prioritize"" immigration judges for any personnel decisions based on judges' prior experience. There are outliers to the rule. NPR identified judges terminated that had no immigration defense experience and were instead DOJ and DHS veterans. Similarly, the administration did keep some judges who had defended immigrants. Still, the large number of firings has long raised questions among judges like Petit over how this benefits the Trump administration's goal of mass deportations.

PETIT: I know it's not agency needs because they're hiring other immigration judges.

BUSTILLO: Petit, the judge in Virginia, is referring to 11 new permanent judges. They have prior experience in immigration enforcement, the military and federal service. They don't seem to have prior immigration defense experience. In the announcement, DOJ said that the new judges are, quote, ""joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law,"" and that integrity is being restored to the agency.

Dana Leigh Marks was an immigration judge for 35 years and retired in 2021. She says having the courts and enforcement under the same branch of government means the courts are never fully independent.

DANA LEIGH MARKS: What's happening now is that because the immigration courts are in an executive branch agency which does have - rightfully - policy considerations, it skews the role of the immigration court system.

BUSTILLO: Marks and other former judges ultimately say the reshaping of the immigration court workforce impacts the limited due process immigrants get. The rapid firings, they say, changes the perception of how fair these courts will be as the administration aims to increase the number of people going through the system.

Unofficial Nov. 4 election results show Sheriff Fred Harran, the incumbent Republican sheriff who brought the controversial Immigrations Customs and Enforcement program to Bucks County, was defeated in his re-election bid by Democrat Danny Ceisler, who promised to kill the program.

On Wednesday, senior ACLU attorney Stephen Loney Jr. confirmed that the civil rights organization wants an appellate court ruling on the the ICE force-multiplier program known as 287G, which deputizes local and state law enforcement to act as ICE officers.

“Harran is still sheriff, with his illegal agreement, for another two months or so,” Loney said. “And we need an appellate ruling on the county judge’s decision either way so that officials don’t think they have license to enter intergovernmental cooperation agreements without going through the necessary approvals.”

Bucks County, which filed a counter claim against Harran seeking to nullify the agreement, also plans to continue its appeal of Judge Jeffrey Trauger’s Oct. 15 ruling, county spokesman James O’Malley said.

In his decision, Trauger found Harran was within his authority when he signed the 287G agreement with ICE because it was a Memo of Understanding, which is not a legally-binding document.

Bucks County, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project contended that Harran signed a Memorandum of Agreement with ICE, which can be legally-binding, and Harran lacked the authority under state law to enter into it without county commissioner approval.

The 287G program was among the major campaign issues in the Sheriff’s race this year.

Harran called the program a crime fighting tool that would not cost taxpayers anything and target only undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated at the county jail or wanted on bench warrants.

He has said 17 of his staff, including himself, are deputized as ICE officers, but Harran has not confirmed if the officers have started performing ICE duties. A Right to Know request is pending with the Sheriff’s Office seeking a copy of the directives that Harran has said deputies will be required to follow.

He also repeatedly promised he did not intend to exercise the full authority granted him under 287g, and had no intention of checking immigration status of witnesses or crime victims, people at the Domestic Relations Court or stop individuals in the community.

Opponents of the program organized two community rallies against 287g attracting more than 100 participants and filled one of the larges courtroom at the Bucks County Justice Center on the first of two days of testimony in the ACLU-Community Justice Project lawsuit seeking to nullify the agreement.

Critics argued that it opens the door to racial profiling, puts taxpayers at risk for lawsuits, discourages immigrants from reporting crime and erodes trust between the immigrant communities and law enforcement.

They also pointed out that Harran retained the authority for deputies to question any person believed to be undocumented and arrest them if determined to be a removable alien.

Bucks County is among 10 Pennsylvania county sheriff offices with approved 287g programs, and the only one Philadelphia collar communities, according to ICE data.

The count does not include assistant chief immigration judges (ACIJ), who are courthouse supervisors and also have their own dockets.
Each fired judge can leave behind thousands of cases, according to several interviews with fired judges throughout the year.
""These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.""
Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied.","For three immigration judges, the day took a similar turn.

Kyra Lilien, who was hired in 2023, was presiding in a courtroom in Concord, Calif., in July when she paused the hearing of an immigrant seeking asylum to read an email.

""I told them that we were not going to have a hearing because I had just been fired,"" Lilien said. Present in the court was a court interpreter and an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security. ""They asked me if I was joking.""

Anam Petit, who was hired as an immigration judge in 2023 after a career in immigrant defense, was sitting on the bench in her courtroom in Virginia's Annandale Immigration Court in September. It was her two-year anniversary in the position and she was between hearings when she got the email.

""My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. My mind was racing. And I gave the decision and I dismissed everyone without mentioning anything,"" Petit said. One decision that day was to deny asylum, and the other was a partial denial, each for a different member of one immigrant family, she recalled.

Tania Nemer was hired as a judge at the Cleveland immigration court in 2023. She had about 30 or 40 immigrants, a DHS attorney and staff in her court one morning in February. She had just finished explaining rights and responsibilities to the group when her door opened and her manager asked her to come with him. She was later escorted out of the building.

""I didn't know at all why I was being fired at the time. And I kept asking; no one had a reason,"" Nemer said.

Nemer was one of the first immigration judges fired by the Trump administration after a slew of dismissals of leaders at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the branch of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. Later that month, the administration fired 12 judges — an entire incoming class that had just been trained and was about to take the bench.

Those dismissals come as the administration has ramped up mass deportations of those without legal status, and sometimes pointed to judges as obstacles in that effort.

The pattern has been consistent. Every few months this year, a new class of judges gets termination notices in the middle of the day, often while they are in the middle of immigration court proceedings. The notices often target those who have reached the end of their two-year probationary period, a trial period for federal workers before they are ""converted"" to permanent employees. It was previously common for these civil servants to be converted to permanent employees of the DOJ.

""None of us have been given an explanation, we are in the dark, but we've been trying to ascertain patterns,"" Lilien said, the former judge in northern California. She wonders if her past experience representing immigrants got her fired, even though she also worked at DHS as an asylum officer.

Her hunch has some correlation with the data. NPR has independently identified 70 immigration judges who received termination notices from the Trump administration between February and October. The number matches the tally kept by the union that represents immigration judges of judges who received termination letters, as well as NPR's past coverage of the terminations.

The count does not include assistant chief immigration judges (ACIJ), who are courthouse supervisors and also have their own dockets. The union has counted 11 ACIJs terminated.

An analysis of each of the 70 immigration judges' professional backgrounds found that judges with backgrounds defending immigrants, and no prior work history at DHS, made up about 44% of the firings — more than double the share of those who had only prior work history at DHS.

NPR also analyzed the classes of judges onboarded between February 2023 and November 2024, who would have neared the ends of their probationary periods this year or are still in the probationary period. Of those judges, those who had prior DHS experience, including working as asylum officers and as attorneys for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, made up the largest share still on the bench.

NPR reached out to the DOJ, EOIR and the White House for a comment on the firings and NPR's findings. The press staff at EOIR is furloughed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, according to automatic email replies, though immigration courts are still operational. The White House referred questions to the DOJ.

""DOJ doesn't 'target' or 'prioritize' immigration judges for any personnel decision one way or the other based on prior experience,"" a DOJ spokesperson told NPR in a statement. ""DOJ continually evaluates all immigration judges, regardless of background, on factors such as conduct, impartiality/bias, adherence to the law, productivity/performance, and professionalism.""

The spokesperson added that, ""pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, IJs (Immigration Judges) are inferior officers who are appointed and removed by the Attorney General.""

The spokesperson disputed the 70 count, saying the agency has terminated fewer than 55 judges, but was unable to provide more details. The agency's number is inconsistent with other news reports, NPR's prior reporting and the union. NPR reached out to reconcile the numbers. The DOJ spokesperson said staff have been furloughed and the Justice Department is not able to confirm their data.

Employees search for reasons

Fired judges have been grasping at straws to understand why they were fired — some have filed Freedom of Information Act requests. Others have turned to wrongful termination complaints and lawsuits. Some worry they were targeted on the basis of protected classes, such as gender or race.

""I fit the bill,"" said Nemer, who had represented immigrants prior to becoming an immigration judge. Nemer listed off characteristics cited in a lawsuit she has filed, arguing she was fired based on various protected classes.

""It's hard to know without having the explanations of why judges were fired,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on immigration policy. ""But the way the Trump administration is approaching immigration courts reflects a really high prioritization of immigration enforcement and [the administration] has really made deportations this whole-of-government effort.""

Immigration judges approve or deny a final order of deportation. Court officials have placed pressure on judges to move through their dockets faster, including by reviewing asylum cases without hearings.

Each fired judge can leave behind thousands of cases, according to several interviews with fired judges throughout the year. Each case is an immigrant who has likely already waited years for their day in court, to make the case for why they should be allowed to stay in the U.S.

Many of these cases have now been reassigned to other judges, at the bottom of their already years-long dockets. Immigrants whose cases were already in progress, or set to be reviewed soon, now have new dates as far out as 2029.

There were 700 immigration judges at the start of the year. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress approved a spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges, to address the backlog of millions of cases at immigration court.

Fear of retribution

Probationary judges aren't the only ones who have been fired under the Trump administration. NPR tracked 12 fired judges who started prior to 2023. This means they were fired after their two-year probationary period.

Some have been left wondering if their firings were retribution for the decisions they made on the bench.

Shira Levine had worked for EOIR since 2021 before being fired in September. She was presiding over a hearing for an immigrant who had already waited more than five years for a day in court when she got the email.

""People looked surprised, but no one looked shocked,"" Levine said. ""That's because, unfortunately, this by that point had become a pattern."" She said she didn't expect to be removed since she had passed her two-year mark. She was never given a reason.

Levine, like several others, received a standard email that they were being terminated pursuant to Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to dismiss federal employees.

Levine thought she might have been dismissed because of her response to some recent Trump administration policies.

During the summer months, immigration judges had already had to contend with an outsized enforcement presence in normally empty courtroom hallways. ICE attorneys — who argue on behalf of a government that an immigrant should be deported — started more regularly filing ""motions to dismiss"" cases. When a judge granted such a motion, migrants would be detained before leaving the building.

Levine said such motions should be granted if there is a change in the individual migrant's case, not a change in immigration policy.

""I was not told it was because of my decision to deny the motion to dismiss that I was fired,"" Levine said. ""But I handed down a decision that contravened what they apparently wanted the judges to do.""

Others, like Ila Deiss or Emmett Soper, who had been immigration judges since 2017 and 2016, served as career officials at the DOJ for nearly two decades.

Soper had been with EOIR since graduating law school in a variety of other roles. He doesn't know if his firing had anything to do with past policy work under the Biden administration's EOIR director or his handling of cases as a judge.

As the Trump administration brings in new people to the bench, he has concerns over the loss of experienced judges.

""You have to be able to manage your courtroom and you have to make very difficult, sometimes life-or-death decisions, with the person whose life is going to be affected and the family members sometimes right in front of you,"" Soper said.

""It's not something that you pick up right away. And with all of these judges — many of whom are very experienced — being fired, the agency is losing something that will take a long time to get back, if they ever can.""

Prior political interference

The agency is prioritizing other judges to hire.

The Trump administration has moved to bring back immigration judges it sees as unfairly fired by the Biden administration. The Justice Department, in a February memo, said that it cannot be confident the Biden administration was ethical and lawful in how it dismissed immigration judges and other adjudicators.

A handful of judges in 2022 had not been converted to permanent employment, sparking GOP outrage over what lawmakers saw as political interference.

Earlier this year, Matthew O'Brien and David White, two of those judges let go under President Joe Biden, were reinstated at immigration courts in Virginia. O'Brien was brought back to a managerial position, as NPR previously reported — though he is no longer with EOIR. White is a judge at the Falls Church court.

The Justice Department appointed a new director of EOIR, Daren Margolin, in October. Margolin has previous experience as the assistant chief immigration judge, or courthouse supervisor, throughout multiple courts in California, and a background as a military and DHS lawyer. He had been fired from a command position at a Marine base for negligently firing a gun and had left EOIR in 2024 before returning to lead the agency.

Then the DOJ last month announced its first class of 2025, which included 25 temporary judges who are military lawyers.

""EOIR is restoring its integrity as a preeminent administrative adjudicatory agency,"" the announcement states. ""These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.""

The incoming class of permanent judges comprises mostly those with a background in federal government work, including EOIR itself and the Department of Homeland Security. Their previous jobs included training Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, serving as asylum officers and working for ICE's legal arm.

One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year, but was among the initial class of judges fired before they could start. None of the incoming judges appear to have previously worked in the field of immigrant defense based on EOIR's announcement.

Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time

In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied. Many came to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others became judges after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or in private practice. Some have no immigration law experience, which was previously a requirement for temporary judges but not for permanent ones.

When immigration courts were first established, it was more common for immigration judges to have an enforcement background, said Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and immigration attorney who litigated landmark immigration cases before the Supreme Court.

Marks joined the court in 1987, when courts were still under the former Immigration and Naturalization Service branch of the DOJ.

""Frankly, I was one of the individuals who was hired to show that it wasn't just a career path of prosecution that led you to be eligible to be an immigration judge,"" Marks said.

That push for professional diversification carried through the Biden administration. That administration selected as immigration judges not just immigration attorneys, but also criminal defense attorneys, other administrative judges across the federal government, and those with military experience, as it sought to diversify the perspectives of those interpreting the complicated set of immigration laws.

Marks said that the president and his cabinet will continue to affect personnel decisions as long as these courts stay in the executive branch.

""It's common sense that the boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge,"" Marks said, recalling the fight to keep immigration courts separate from immigration enforcement when DHS was created in 2002. Enforcement, which is primarily ICE, was separated from the DOJ.

I was part of the Durango community for 12 years.
Since we moved away three months ago, three women have been killed by gun violence in Durango.
Schoolchildren in the U.S., meanwhile, routinely go to school and never come home, whether because of gun violence or ICE agents.
Schoolchildren in the U.S., meanwhile, routinely go to school and never come home, whether because of gun violence or ICE agents.","On Oct. 27, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers took two children and their father from outside a middle school in Durango, Colorado. The kids and their parents, who were originally from Colombia, had come to the United States seeking safety and opportunity, as so many immigrants have done before them. They had applied for legal asylum, with paperwork to prove it. Now they’re separated, traumatized and afraid.

This is not the first time ICE has severed families in Durango. A few weeks earlier, another father was detained while driving his children to school and was later deported to Mexico in the middle of the night. In an attempt to keep the Colombian family from likewise being whisked away under cover of darkness, a rapid response team put out a call for people to stand watch at Durango’s ICE facility. More than a hundred showed up, linking arms to form a peaceful blockade. Throughout the night, as temperatures fell below freezing, protesters took shifts — huddling under blankets, sharing hot beverages, chanting and playing music. The horror unfolding inside the facility stood in sharp contrast with the love and support from the community outside.

I was part of the Durango community for 12 years. Then, this past August, my husband, daughter and I did much the same thing that the Colombian family had done, albeit under very different circumstances: We left behind the familiarity of home and migrated north to start a new life in a new country, seeking a more hopeful future for our family. We now live in a small town in coastal British Columbia, and it’s from this new vantage that I’ve watched ICE’s recent raids unfold.

As the sun rose over the mesas surrounding Durango and drove away the chill of night, state and local police officers arrived, along with federal officials tasked with breaking up the protest so that ICE could move the children and their father to a detention center elsewhere. That’s when things got violent. Friends began texting me videos, and more streamed in on social media. I felt helpless, watching from afar as people I knew were blasted with pepper spray or shot with rubber bullets, simply for believing that innocent children should not be handcuffed and torn away from their community and family. One young protester was dragged viciously across the pavement by a masked officer wearing what appeared to be tactical military gear. A friend reported that her stepdad, a Vietnam veteran, was pepper-sprayed; another sent a video of an officer roughly throwing a slight silver-haired woman to the ground.

I’ve seen similar videos from protests in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland, and read about detentions in other small Colorado towns. But to see this happening in my own community and to not be there to help felt surreal and painful. I wrote letters, made phone calls, donated to GoFundMe campaigns. None of it felt like enough.

As a journalist during the first Trump administration, I had reported on how people were affected by xenophobic immigration policies, and how small rural communities rallied to shelter and protect their neighbors. Living in Canada, I no longer have access to report such stories, but I do have a new clarity on how violence — in large part stemming from federal action or inaction — now permeates life in the U.S. Even in bucolic towns like Durango. And even before the most recent ICE raids.

Since we moved away three months ago, three women have been killed by gun violence in Durango. In September, a gunman opened fire at a high school in Evergreen, Colorado, wounding two students and traumatizing many others. Reading about the shooting in the news made me recall the constant low-level fear of having my own child in a U.S. public school. I remember the police officers posted outside the locked doors most days, and I will never forget the day a threat of violence put Durango schools on a real lockdown. I remember my first-grader, barely holding back tears, running into my arms when I picked up her that afternoon.

Schoolchildren in the U.S., meanwhile, routinely go to school and never come home, whether because of gun violence or ICE agents.

All this factored into our decision to move to Canada. Here, gun violence is so rare that my husband, an emergency room nurse, is the only health-care worker in his department who has ever treated a gunshot wound. (And he’s treated many.) The doors of my daughter’s new school are usually unlocked, open to welcome students who have come here from around the world. And while both Canada and the United States share the same dark history of sending Indigenous children to boarding schools from which many never returned, Canadians are doing far more, in my experience, to reconcile that history and make schools safer and more inclusive. Schoolchildren in the U.S., meanwhile, routinely go to school and never come home, whether because of gun violence or ICE agents.

Yet the gratitude I feel for our new home is cut with an undercurrent of grief. Grief over leaving our Colorado community and not being there to fight alongside our neighbors; grief that it took this much luck and privilege and effort simply to send our daughter to school without worrying for her safety. Grief that we have been welcomed into a new country, while my home country is slamming its doors on people in need.

But what I see most clearly, from this distance, is how important community and neighbors are, especially in times of darkness. How we need each other to link arms in the face of brutality — past or present — and say No: Not here. Not on our watch. There is a better way forward, and from my new home, I can see glimpses of what it might look like.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former lawmaker who campaigned on promptly repealing the policy, known as the Immigrant Trust Directive, and ramping up immigration enforcement. He recruited a sheriff eager to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as his running-mate. Sherrill, who has served as a U.S. Representative since 2019, has generally been more critical of Trump’s immigration agenda and has spoken positively about the directive.

But she has also declined to say whether she’d keep it in place. The policy isn’t codified into state law, meaning that future attorneys general, who are appointed by the governor, could rescind it.

Anxious about whether Sherrill will maintain the directive, advocates say lawmakers must pass legislation enshrining the state’s policy during the winter’s lame duck session to preserve protections for the state’s roughly 2.2 million immigrants. If passed by January, such a bill would prevent future administrations from walking back the limits on local immigration enforcement embedded in the Immigrant Trust Directive.

“It’s a policy which can disappear, you know, whenever the governor changes, and as we’ve seen, we’re not even sure if there’s a Democrat succeeding the current Democrat if she’ll keep it in place,” Adam McGovern, who leads advocacy efforts for the immigration activist group Wind of the Spirit, told Bolts. “It’s in the hands of the current legislature and the current governor, and you know, we need them to step up and get it passed.”

Dozens of lawmakers have sponsored legislation, known as the Immigrant Trust Act, that would embed existing protections for immigrants into state law and expand them to include protection from sharing data that would tip off authorities to someone’s immigration status. The bill hasn’t moved since being introduced by Democratic Senator Gordon Johnson last year.

A spokesperson for outgoing Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who would have to sign any legislation passed in coming months, told Bolts in an email, “We would respectfully decline to comment on pending legislation.” Murphy has supported the directive, which was issued in 2018 by an attorney general he appointed.

In New Jersey, the lame-duck period that starts after November’s elections, when lawmakers return to Trenton after facing reelection, is often productive for passing new legislation.

The bill would mirror the restrictions embedded in the attorney general’s directive. Those include a prohibition on law enforcement inquiring about citizenship status when it doesn’t relate to an investigation, and a ban on local law enforcement from participating in ICE’s 287(g) program, which deputizes law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.

Sheriffs and police departments around the country have rushed to join the 287(g) program since Trump’s return to office, but New Jersey’s conservative sheriffs have not been able to follow suit due to the Murphy administration’s approach. Several other states, including California and Delaware, have passed legislation to ban local authorities from entering 287(g) contracts.

On the campaign trail, Sherrill expressed concerns about the Immigrant Trust Act, saying she feared it could expose the state to fresh legal challenges.

She spoke favorably of the attorney general’s existing directive, telling Politico New Jersey in January that it’s “a plan that’s working,” while remaining tight-lipped about how her administration would treat it if she became governor.

“What I’m going to do is make sure we’re following the law and the Constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the Constitution,” she said of her position on the policy when asked during a debate.

Her campaign team did not return requests for comment.

The state’s policy of limiting cooperation between ICE and New Jersey authorities has been upheld by two federal courts following challenges from federal and county authorities. The Trump administration has asked federal courts to reconsider the ruling in light of a lawsuit it filed in May against four New Jersey cities over their policies on local authorities assisting ICE. Lawyers for the cities are asking the judge to dismiss the litigation.

Ahead of the legislature’s return to Trenton, McGovern said Wind of the Spirit activists plan to travel to the state capital twice a week to ask legislators to support the Immigrant Trust Act.

ICE has arrested more than 3,000 people in New Jersey in the eight months since President Donald Trump took office for a second term. Most recently, agents raided a Woodbridge warehouse and took 46 people into custody.

Many immigrants now fear leaving their homes, Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey, told Bolts. “There are communities where people are keeping their kids home from school,” he said. “People are not going to church or not going to the doctor because they fear being picked up by ice or having their family separated.”

Sinha added, “We need to do whatever we can in New Jersey to protect our people, and that includes maintaining the Immigrant Trust Directive and passing the Immigrant Trust Act.”

Asma Elhuni, an organizer with Resistencia En Accion, said she’s seen New Jersey law enforcement agencies assist ICE by forming perimeters during raids or arresting community members. Passing the legislation would create a “bright line in the law to ensure that our local police and public agencies are not acting as an arm of ICE,” she said.

In the absence of a state law, Hoboken last month adopted the Hoboken Trust Act, an ordinance that permanently prohibits the city from using resources for federal civil immigration enforcement.

Kathy O’Leary, coordinator of immigrant advocacy group Pax Christi New Jersey, helps host vigils outside of Delaney Hall, a federal immigrant detention center in Newark, and provide support for family members. The center has also seen large protests from activists this year. In May, ICE officers arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka while he visited the facility.

“We witness how difficult it is when a family member is detained,” said O’Leary. “We know that the best way to help families in our communities is to keep them from ending up in detention. The state of NJ can do much more to protect families.”",https://boltsmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25308532575513-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:56:59.387853

The officer sustained a deep laceration requiring 13 stitches, plus several burns to his face.

Authorities say the suspect, Walter Leonel Perez Rodriguez, a previously deported Salvadoran national with convictions for sexual assault of a minor, child fondling and multiple DUIs, attacked the officer while agents attempted to take him into custody.

Perez, who had been deported from the United States twice — first in June 2013 and again in February 2020 — allegedly reentered the country illegally at an unknown time and location, according to DHS. He's now in ICE custody.

DHS Assistant Secretary for External Affairs Tricia McLaughlin condemned the assault and said, ""Anyone who lays a hand on our ICE officer will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Death threats targeting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have increased 8,000%, DHS announced in October, pointing to a wave of online harassment and violent rhetoric aimed at agents and their families. DHS Officials have not yet provided further data about the explosion in death threats, however.

Last month, federal agents arrested Eduardo Aguilar, a Mexican national in Dallas accused of offering money on TikTok for the murder of ICE agents. According to DHS, investigators have tracked a series of threatening phone calls and social media posts targeting officers in Texas and Washington state.

In Texas, an ICE officer's spouse received a threatening call, according to a release by DHS. ""I don't know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you,"" the caller said, according to DHS. ""Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it's what's going to happen to your family.""

A separate voicemail left on an ICE employee's phone was also discovered, according to DHS, in which a caller says, ""I hope every one of those lawless c**** you call ICE officers gets doxxed one by one.""

Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol Gregory Bovino told CBS News in an interview last month that such incidents reflect a broader surge in violence against federal agents nationwide.

""What we're seeing here in Chicago are oftentimes United States citizens attacking Border Patrol agents, ICE agents, and allied law enforcement,"" Bovino said. ""When that happens, if you attack us, we're going to arrest you and take you to jail. That shouldn't be normal, and we don't want it to be normal — but that's what's happening now.""

Bovino said transnational criminal groups have gone so far as to place bounties on the heads of federal officers.

""The Latin Kings here in Chicago put a bounty out on the heads of federal law enforcement,"" he said. ""You bet we're going to go where those Latin Kings are. Don't put a bounty on our heads — we're going to come after yours.""

This week, a federal judge in Chicago is considering a preliminary injunction over the tactics used by federal agents during Chicago's ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" including claims that Bovino oversaw use of tear gas and other riot control measures used against protesters, journalists, and clergy. The case highlights growing scrutiny over how federal agencies deploy riot control weapons and less than lethal tactics in urban settings and how frontline threats to agents compound already aggressive operations.

At a press conference in Gary, Indiana, last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the recent wave of attacks against immigration officers ""unacceptable,"" adding, ""Every single ICE officer has someone who loves them — a family member, someone who cares that they come home at night.""

On Oct. 1, the FBI and DHS issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning that ""domestic violent extremists"" have escalated attacks against ICE facilities and personnel. Since June, the bulletin said, extremists in at least three states have carried out pre-planned violent strikes, including an October rooftop shooting into ICE transport vehicles in Dallas that wounded several detainees. The bulletin cautioned such attacks reflect ""an evolution in tactics and an escalation in violence"" and urged state and local law enforcement to be especially vigilant.

In September, a gunman fired from a rooftop into a secure sally port at a Dallas ICE facility, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before taking his own life. Authorities recovered an unused shell casing inscribed with ""ANTI-ICE"" and said the shooting was likely ideologically motivated. The same facility had been the target of a bomb threat in August, when a man claiming to carry explosives was arrested.

Noem warned that any assault on federal officers will be met with ""the fullest extent of the law.""

The Trump administration is firing scores of immigration judges and bringing on dozens of others. These judges inside the executive branch are often immigrants' last chance to argue why they should stay in the U.S. NPR's Ximena Bustillo and Anusha Mathur have found a pattern in the backgrounds of 70 judges who have been fired. The largest share have experience representing immigrants.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: The story told is often the same. It started out as a dream job.

TANIA NEMER: It was something that, like, I was essentially, like, born to do.

BUSTILLO: Tania Nemer was selected to be an immigration judge in Cleveland.

NEMER: I feel like as the middle child, I was always kind of just put in that situation between siblings and parents and cousins. And I always just loved listening and asking questions and understanding their perspective. And then, if I had a basis to solve the problem, I loved to do that.

BUSTILLO: That's why she loved her job as an immigration judge. But that dream came to an end one day in February, while she was in the middle of a hearing.

NEMER: I had about, you know, 30 or 40 immigrants in my courtroom. I had DHS. I had court staff. I was on the bench, on the record. I had just finished explaining all to the group, like, their rights and responsibilities.

BUSTILLO: Then her supervisor took her aside and Nemer was informed that she was terminated, but not given a reason. She was escorted out of the building. Nemer was among the very first immigration judges to be terminated. Immigration judges are civil servants in the Justice Department, one of the agencies that has seen restructuring in the federal workforce. And since, that scene has played out in courtrooms across the country.

KYRA LILIEN: I think being a judge is sort of a goal, a career goal that a lot of immigration attorneys have.

BUSTILLO: That's Kyra Lilien. She was an immigration judge in Northern California, and she got her email in the middle of an asylum hearing.

LILIEN: The interpreter who was in the courtroom with me, he had been in many hearings with me, and he just started crying, and he said, I can't believe this is happening.

BUSTILLO: She was also never given a reason. Anam Petit was an immigration judge in Virginia also fired during a hearing.

ANAM PETIT: No one has told me why I was let go, you know? So this is all speculative. It has to be because no one has had that conversation with me.

BUSTILLO: NPR has independently identified 70 judges fired by the Trump administration. An analysis of their professional backgrounds show that those who have prior background in immigrant defense make up the largest share of those fired. Out of those onboarded in the last two years, those who have some experience working for the Department of Homeland Security make up the largest share of those still on the bench. Dozens have confirmed to NPR that they were not given a reason for their firings. Several judges have wondered if their own experience defending immigrants was a reason. Here's Lilien, the judge in California.

LILIEN: Anyone who ever represented a noncitizen at any point in their lives - whether they also worked for DHS, whether they worked for ICE - that seems to be the indelible stain that got them fired.

BUSTILLO: The Justice Department said it doesn't, quote, ""target or prioritize"" immigration judges for any personnel decisions based on judges' prior experience. There are outliers to the rule. NPR identified judges terminated that had no immigration defense experience and were instead DOJ and DHS veterans. Similarly, the administration did keep some judges who had defended immigrants. Still, the large number of firings has long raised questions among judges like Petit over how this benefits the Trump administration's goal of mass deportations.

PETIT: I know it's not agency needs because they're hiring other immigration judges.

BUSTILLO: Petit, the judge in Virginia, is referring to 11 new permanent judges. They have prior experience in immigration enforcement, the military and federal service. They don't seem to have prior immigration defense experience. In the announcement, DOJ said that the new judges are, quote, ""joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law,"" and that integrity is being restored to the agency.

Dana Leigh Marks was an immigration judge for 35 years and retired in 2021. She says having the courts and enforcement under the same branch of government means the courts are never fully independent.

DANA LEIGH MARKS: What's happening now is that because the immigration courts are in an executive branch agency which does have - rightfully - policy considerations, it skews the role of the immigration court system.

BUSTILLO: Marks and other former judges ultimately say the reshaping of the immigration court workforce impacts the limited due process immigrants get. The rapid firings, they say, changes the perception of how fair these courts will be as the administration aims to increase the number of people going through the system.

However, Taylor told the court that “no employees are protected by the injunction” at programs, projects and activities at five component agencies within Commerce.

Meanwhile, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is telling the court that none of its RIF notices are covered by the judge’s preliminary injunction.","Most of the 4,000 layoff notices sent to federal employees earlier in the government shutdown are on hold, following a federal court’s order.

But agencies are now telling the court that a fraction of those RIF notices is not covered by the court’s order and can proceed.

These new details, in court documents submitted this week, show that just over 10% of the 4,000 RIFs are not covered by the court’s injunction and can proceed — meaning that those employees remain on track to be separated from their jobs on Dec. 9.

A federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction last month that prohibits agencies from issuing any RIF notices “during and because of the federal government shutdown,” to employees in any program, project or activity that includes any bargaining unit or member represented by eight unions who are leading the lawsuit.

The vast majority of reductions-in-force will remain in effect for now. But the departments of Commerce and Health and Human Services, as well as the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency, told the court that last month’s preliminary injunction does not cover some of the RIF notices they sent.

Crystal Taylor, the Commerce Department’s acting chief human capital officer and director of its Office of Human Resources Management, told the court that more than half of its RIF notices are currently on hold, given the court’s preliminary injunction.

Nearly 250 RIF notices that went out to employees at the Census Bureau, the Minority Business Development Agency and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are currently on hold.

However, Taylor told the court that “no employees are protected by the injunction” at programs, projects and activities at five component agencies within Commerce.

The department’s latest court filing shows that 170 of its RIF notices are not covered by the court’s preliminary injunction. That includes layoff notices sent to employees at the International Trade Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology and FirstNet Authority.

At the Department of Health and Human Services, most of the agency’s nearly 950 RIF notices are subject to the court’s preliminary injunction, and remain on hold.

But Thomas Nagy, the department’s chief human capital officer and deputy assistant secretary for human resources, told the court that approximately 150 RIF notices — about 15% of its latest round of RIF notices — fall outside the court’s injunction.

Meanwhile, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is telling the court that none of its RIF notices are covered by the judge’s preliminary injunction.

Madhu Gottumukkala, CISA’s acting director and deputy director, told the court in a recent filing that none of the 54 CISA employees who received RIF notices on Oct. 10 are covered by the preliminary injunction.

The Justice Department told the court that it sent RIF notices to two employees more than a week before the start of the government shutdown, and were “part of a long-planned agency reorganization.”

Jolene Ann Lauria, assistant attorney general for administration at the Justice Department, told the court that “the agency does not need to take any steps to comply with the order,” and that it doesn’t have plans to send any additional RIF notices.

Germany’s conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz suspended the programme in May in a bid to show his administration’s seriousness about tackling migration, a major concern for German voters at a time when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) tops several opinion polls.

“It is logical that if we assume that people have no possibility of being admitted to Germany, we offer them some perspective, and this is linked to making a financial offer for a voluntary return to Afghanistan or another third country,” German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said on Wednesday.

“These offers have been made to these people in recent days,” Dobrindt said, without revealing how much money was involved or the number of people being excluded from entry.

Afghan nationals who already hold binding approval to enter Germany under the suspended programme will still be allowed to enter the country – subject to security checks – but others will not, the minister added.

German media outlets report the payments amount to several thousand euros (dollars), with a first instalment available for those who agree to accept made in Pakistan and more payments on arrival in Afghanistan or a third country.

Germany’s DPA news agency said the pay offer has been sharply criticised by Afghans in Pakistan who had hoped to relocate to Germany, while others had expressed shock and disappointment.

“We have spent two years in Pakistan, and now we are being offered a shameful and foolish deal that jeopardises our future and that of our children,” an Afghan who received the government’s offer in a letter told the news organisation.

In addition to local staff, who once worked for German institutions, and their families in Afghanistan, DPA said the relocation programme was designed to “admit Afghans who fear persecution by the Taliban” for having worked as lawyers or journalists, or those who dealt with human rights issues.

The news organisation also reported that a group of 31 Afghans approved for resettlement under the scheme had arrived from Pakistan in the north German city of Hanover on Tuesday evening.

Officials said the group were “exclusively persons for whom legally binding court orders oblige the Federal Republic of Germany” to allow them to enter the country.

""When driving while Brown becomes a basis for detention, our community loses trust in law enforcement,"" said Dulce J. López, Immigrant Rights Advocacy Strategist for the ACLU of South Carolina.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out a two-night operation in Charleston County early this week, primarily in North Charleston, according to eyewitnesses.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and Highway Patrol (SCHP) assisted in the operation. SLED confirmed it assisted in an operation on Sunday, Nov. 2 and Monday, Nov. 3, while several SCHP vehicles and state troopers can be seen in photos and video taken of the operation on Monday evening.

What happened?

The Charleston chapter of the Community Service Organization, an immigrant advocacy group, said a number of people were detained Monday evening along Rivers Avenue and Remount Road. One eyewitness told CSO she watched SLED seem to pull over ""exclusively Latino-appearing drivers"" before ICE would reportedly move in with unmarked vehicles. SLED declined to comment further than confirming the days, location, and their assistance in the operation, directing further inquiries to Homeland Security Investigations and ICE, who have yet to respond.

The South Carolina Department of Public Safety said that SCHP was requested to participate in the operation and that two troopers were assigned to conduct traffic stops.

CSO reports that 10 different incidents were documented, and in at least one an eyewitness said a ""very distraught"" minor was left behind as individuals were taken away in vans. It is unclear how many people were detained in total during the operation, but it is likely that individuals arrested during the operation were taken to be processed at a local ICE office or other holding facility.

A North Charleston Police Department officer was spotted in the area during the operation, but department spokesperson Harve Jacobs said the officer was checking on a state trooper who did not answer the radio for dispatch. Once he confirmed the trooper was fine and realized he was amongst an active ICE operation, the officer left the scene. Jacobs said no NCPD officers were involved in the ICE operations. Similarly, a Charleston County Sheriff's Office vehicle was seen during one of the incidents, but was merely traveling in the area and stopped by when they noticed other law enforcement in the area, according to a sheriff's office spokesperson.

Lili Allen said she was driving home from work in North Charleston Monday afternoon and stopped for gas before noticing a number of marked and unmarked vehicles in the parking lot across the street. She said she decided to check out what was going on and began filming with her phone, finding two individuals in handcuffs surrounded by law enforcement. She reported that many of the agents had their faces covered and wouldn't respond to her asking who they were with.

""I looked a little bit more and there was a third person, and they were just standing there,"" she recalled. ""They had what I assume was a loved one who was pretty upset a couple of feet away. I went and talked to her to see how she was doing and she was visibly upset and said, you know, like, 'my friends, they took my friends.'""

Allen said she had ""know-your-rights"" cards in her car that were written in Spanish, and she wanted to offer them to the people being detained.

""I wanted them to have that option. And one man was already shackled, and so he looked at me and he opened his mouth for me to put the card into his mouth because he wasn't able to pick it up with his hands,"" she said. ""And so what I would say is that dehumanizing moment was unnecessary, right? Like they were standing there being compliant and in order for this person to get this card, he has to open his mouth to get it. It didn't sit well with me.""

Alex Panfilovich, a Belarusian immigrant and dual citizen since 2022, lives and works in the area and said she notices a law enforcement presence often, but when she spotted unmarked SUVs alongside Highway Patrol vehicles, she had a feeling ICE was nearby. She said she pulled over to record as agents and troopers detained two men outside a laundromat on Rivers Avenue.

""I have never seen or heard of ICE agents being assisted by someone who should be policing traffic, but that happened on Monday night,"" said Panfilovich. ""It was very scary to watch.""

She added that she and another person recording the incident were asked to step away while officers searched the detainee's vehicle.

""It's clear that ICE is ramping up activity in the Lowcountry,"" she said. ""They're not trying to hide it anymore.""

Concern about racial profiling

Since the Sept. 9 US Supreme Court ruling in Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem activists and concerned citizens have been sounding the alarm about ICE racially profiling people to detain. The case challenged the Department of Homeland Security agencies in Los Angeles' alleged use of racial profiling, suspicionless stops, warrantless raids, and illegal worksite operations. The Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to lift a lower court's ban on these ""roving patrol"" tactics.

""It's scary to see people snatched away from the community when they are just going home, living their lives, going to work, going home, taking their kids to school, being unable to go to the DMV or the grocery store when it's been so easy for me,"" Panfilovich said. ""And it's pretty clear why this is happening.""

""When driving while Brown becomes a basis for detention, our community loses trust in law enforcement,"" said Dulce J. López, Immigrant Rights Advocacy Strategist for the ACLU of South Carolina. López said that Highway Patrol detaining Latino drivers and handing them over to ICE blurs the line between local policing and federal law enforcement via the utilization of 287(g) agreements.

These agreements between local and state agencies and ICE allow them to identify, detain, and arrest people for potential deportation, which is usually the federal agency's job. The Charleston County Sheriff's Office rejoined the 287(g) program in March, while the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, including SCHP, requested to participate in August, according to The State newspaper. SCDPS operates at the ""Task Force Level"" of the agreement, essentially turning state troopers into ICE agents, according to the ACLU.

CCSO operates on the ""Warrant Service Officer"" level of 287(g), which allows ICE officers to train and certify deputies to execute civil immigration warrants on behalf of ICE to individuals booked at the Charleston County jail, regardless of arresting agency. ""It enables our agency to assist in the removal of individuals in custody who have committed serious crimes and are in the U.S. unlawfully,"" CCSO said in a statement back in March.

Regardless of 287(g) partnership levels, Lucía Peña, co-founder of CSO, says the impacts of operations like those on Sunday and Monday echo through the immigrant community well after the masked men and unmarked vehicles leave.

“The fear lingers,"" Peña said. ""Families are afraid to drive to work, take their kids to school, or even get groceries – it’s deeply unsettling.”

Named for a 22-year-old Georgia woman murdered in 2024 by a Venezuelan immigrant, the Laken Riley Act requires ICE to detain noncitizens who are charged, convicted or even arrested for a bevy of crimes.
But that would be “entirely inconsistent with the Laken Riley Act,” Liman found.
Months prior, another federal judge invoked the law when freeing an ICE detainee from Brazil, who was arrested in May following a routine hearing in immigration court.","MANHATTAN (CN) — A federal judge invoked a President Donald Trump-touted immigration law when ordering the release of Maria Tumba Huamani, a 20-year-old asylum-seeker from Peru who has been detained for the past month 1,000 miles away from her home in New York City.

Videos of Huamani’s September arrest went viral. Masked federal agents swarmed her elevator at 26 Federal Plaza, a lower Manhattan immigration courthouse, then violently pushed reporters away who tried to board along with them; one photographer was hospitalized in the scuffle. Since then, Huamani was being held in an immigration detention facility in Louisiana, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement hoped she’d stay until her eventual removal.

But U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman thwarted those plans late Tuesday night, granting Huamani’s habeas corpus petition and ruling there is a “complete absence of any reason” for her to stay detained.

In his 19-page order for Huamani’s release, Liman cited an unexpected source: the Laken Riley Act, a GOP-led bill signed into law this year by Trump that drastically broadened ICE’s ability to detain noncitizens.

Named for a 22-year-old Georgia woman murdered in 2024 by a Venezuelan immigrant, the Laken Riley Act requires ICE to detain noncitizens who are charged, convicted or even arrested for a bevy of crimes. It was championed by Republicans, who sought a quick crackdown on what they called a nationwide immigration crisis, but criticized by many Democrats who worried the measure would strip noncitizens of their due process rights.

It ultimately passed with bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, where nearly two dozen Democrats joined the Republican caucus to get it onto Trump’s desk.

But amid the Trump administration’s broad deportation agenda, in which federal agents are detaining noncitizens who lack any criminal records whatsoever, judges around the country are citing that same law in their orders to release ICE prisoners.

In his Tuesday ruling, Liman questioned why Congress would have passed the Laken Riley Act in the first place if ICE is claiming it can justifiably detain asylum seekers like Huamani, who has not been accused of any criminal acts at all.

“Why, then, would Congress have thought it necessary to specifically add a provision making those noncitizens subject to mandatory detention if they are charged with certain crimes?” wrote Liman, a Trump appointee in the Southern District of New York. “The government has no answer.”

The government in Huamani’s case, and in many similar habeas cases around the country, argues it has broad discretion under federal immigration law to detain any person that enters the country without authorization.

But that would be “entirely inconsistent with the Laken Riley Act,” Liman found.

Months prior, another federal judge invoked the law when freeing an ICE detainee from Brazil, who was arrested in May following a routine hearing in immigration court. In that case too, the man was detained pursuant to the government’s argument that he entered the United States without authorization and can therefore be jailed.

“Such an interpretation, which would largely nullify a statute Congress enacted this very year, must be rejected,” wrote U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick, a Joe Biden appointee in Massachusetts federal court, referring to the act.

And U.S. District Judge Orelia Merchant, a Joe Biden appointee in the Eastern District of New York, similarly acknowledged in a ruling from last month that accepting the government’s broad detention discretion would render the act’s criminal conduct requirement “superfluous.”

Speaking to Courthouse News on Wednesday, New York University immigration law professor Adam Cox said these rulings illustrate just how far ICE is trying to push boundaries.

“It’s showing that the Trump administration’s interpretation of these older immigration statutes is so novel and so extreme that Congress’ more recent efforts — even though those were designed to lock more immigrants up — highlight that the administration’s views don’t make sense,” he said.

Now that the administration is claiming that it’s always had the right to detain any unauthorized entrant, the act’s comparably narrower scope is proving somewhat of a liability for ICE’s broadest arrests. In effect, the law is making it easier to free certain detainees, despite it existing to justify more detentions than ever.

Cox noted it is still accomplishing that goal too, as the law also makes it infinitely harder for those so much as accused of criminal conduct to avoid immigration jail.

“It is definitely true that it is now easier to detain any noncitizen who’s here, who’s entered without authorization and is living in this country,” Cox said of the act.

For Huamani, though, Liman ruled that her due process rights were indeed violated by her “violent” on-camera arrest. She’s in the process of returning home to the Bronx, according to her legal team, where she’ll continue fighting the government’s efforts to deport her.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/01/donald-trump-at-laken-riley-act-signing-ceremony.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-06 06:00:42.871463

ICE officials said the stray bullet didn’t impact the aircraft’s ability to fly, and it isn’t clear who fired the bullet that struck the plane.

In the early morning hours of Oct. 29, the Mesa Police Department responded to a trespassing call at a private property near the airport, where officers encountered 34-year-old Cameron Oberlin.

Oberlin had already been asked to leave by a private security guard for trespassing. When police arrived, he fled and police used a “grappler device” to stop his car, according to media reports.

After a standoff, Oberlin and officers fired at each other and one officer was struck in his right side. That officer has since been released from the hospital, according to a Mesa Police Department spokesperson.

Oberlin died from what Mesa PD said was a “self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.”

“A contracted charter aircraft, N801XT, was struck by a stray bullet while parked on the tarmac at Mesa-Gateway Airport in Mesa, Arizona,” ICE said in a statement to the Arizona Mirror. “The bullet bounced off the plane, and no damage was reported. The incident was reported to the Mesa Police Department. The aircraft was not scheduled for a flight on the day of the incident, and its airworthiness was not affected. Operations were not impacted.”

Mesa police did not provide further information when asked about ICE’s statement and if they had determined who the bullet belonged to.

Arizona, and specifically Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, play a crucial role in ICE’s aerial deportation efforts, which have surged during President Donald Trump’s second term. The airport hosts the agency’s headquarters for its deportation flights, known informally as “ICE Air,” which uses subcontractors and subleases to disguise deportation aircraft.

The airport is also home to a lesser-known detention facility.

While ICE said the aircraft was not impacted by the bullet, historical flight data shows the aircraft was in use the next day — but its flight was aborted minutes after takeoff when the plane turned around and landed without incident. It has not left the airport since. ICE did not respond to follow up questions about the aborted flight.

The aircraft is owned by Avelo Airlines, which has been making deportation flights out of Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport amid increasing public scrutiny. The company has begun painting the aircraft it uses all white, removing their livery as protests of Trump’s deportation agenda have intensified.

Medmarc Cas. Ins. Co. v. Fellows Labriola LLP, 2025 WL 2886733 (11th Cir. Oct. 10, 2025).

A lawyer and law firm represented a husband and wife and their respective companies in a RICO case that settled. Pursuant to the consent order, a receiver was directed to distribute cash from the companies’ bank accounts to the law firm’s IOLTA account for distribution to both companies and to auction off some of the clients’ assets. However, the lawyer and law firm allegedly distributed the funds and auction proceeds only to the husband, who had filed for divorce, and to his company. The ex-wife and her company sued the lawyer and law firm for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract based on the disbursements and undisclosed conflicts of interest.

The lawyer and law firm sought coverage for the malpractice lawsuit under their lawyers professional liability policy. The insurer denied coverage under the misappropriation exclusion, which barred coverage for “any claim[s] or other request[s] involving or relating to any conversion, improper commingling, or misappropriation, whether by an Insured or any other person, and whether intentionally or not, of client funds or trust account funds or funds of any other person held by any Insured in any capacity.” The policy defined “claim” to include “a demand or suit for damages received by the Insured.”

In the ensuing coverage litigation, the district court held that the insurer had a duty to defend the entire lawsuit and the duty to indemnify was not yet ripe. On appeal, the insurer argued that it did not have a duty to defend because the entire malpractice lawsuit was one “claim” and that single “claim” fell under the misappropriation exclusion. In so arguing, the insurer relied, in part, on the “When a Claim is Made” provision, which stated “all claims … involving a single act, error, or omission or series of related act, errors, or omissions shall be deemed to be one claim and to be first made when the first of such claims is made.” The Eleventh Circuit found this argument unpersuasive because “an insured would expect that the sentence in question impacts only when a claim is first made and would not expect it to inform the meaning of ‘claim’ beyond that.”

Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that “[t]here are multiple claims in this suit” and “of those multiple claims, at least some fall outside the misappropriation exclusion.” In particular, the Eleventh Circuit determined that “the conflict of interest allegations … have nothing to do with misappropriation, conversion, or improper commingling.” The Eleventh Circuit refused to construe “involving or relating to” so broadly to include “claims [that] simply involve the same parties and are brought in the same lawsuit.” Affirming the decision below, the Eleventh Circuit held that the insurer had a duty to defend the entire malpractice lawsuit because certain “claims” fell outside the misappropriation exclusion. The Eleventh Circuit also determined that the insurer’s duty to indemnify is not ripe until the underlying malpractice lawsuit is resolved.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16056_1548.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:02:02.810111

A state National Guard is federalized illegally to stop protests by supporters of immigrant due process rights.

Foreign students and faculty, legally in this country, who engage in pro-Palestinian advocacy are threatened with deportation.

The Supreme Court has eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, invalidated a key part of the Voting Rights Act, and weakened laws protecting LGBTQ+ people from discrimination.

In the face of the Trump administration’s hostility to human rights and federal retrenchment in the protection of those rights, what are Americans dedicated to human rights to do?

Our answer? Look increasingly to the states to provide those protections.

Certainly, many states have taken the lead in denying rights of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, union members, and minority voters. So, how can those same states be viewed as potential frontline protectors of those, and other, rights? Here’s how.

Enumerated State Constitutional Rights

Freedom of speech. Protection of habeas corpus. Right to reproductive freedom. Right of workers to organize. Rights to fair and open elections. Free access to public beaches.

This is just a small sampling of provisions, enumerated in various state constitutions, that articulate rights of citizens and non-citizens beyond those found in the U.S. Constitution. Some of these explicit protections go back to the early days of our Republic. Others are of more recent vintage. Common to these enumerated state constitutional rights, however, is that they provide additional layers of human rights protections beyond those provided by the federal government, as called for in Justice William J. Brennan Jr.’s celebrated 1977 law review article, “State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights.”

Unenumerated State Constitutional Rights

The Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” To be sure, there are few instances in our nation’s history in which federal rights have been secured under this amendment. At the state level, however, things may be different.

Some two-thirds of the states have placed language similar to the Ninth Amendment in their state constitutions. And it is to those state-based constitutional protections of unenumerated rights to which human rights advocates increasingly should turn for support.

In Georgia, for example, where newly proposed legislative maps were designed to dilute the representation of minorities, the state constitution states that “[t]he enumeration of rights herein contained . . . shall not be construed to deny to the people any inherent rights. . . .” Couldn’t the right to have equal representation by all voters be deemed an “inherent right,” albeit unenumerated?

In Florida, which has fought to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors, the state constitution says that “[t]he enunciation herein of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or impair others retained by the people.” Couldn’t the right to access necessary medical treatment regardless of sexual expression be deemed an unenumerated right not to be denied or impaired?

International Law

Jus cogens is a fundamental principle of international common law from which no deviation is permitted, anywhere. Torture, slavery, and genocide are examples of activities generally regarded as being banned globally under the principle of jus cogens. And the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948 and regarded as a foundational document in the history of human rights’ protections, sets forth a wide variety of rights to be regarded as universal.

Though the United States has often shied away from signing international human rights treaties and other agreements, international law could play a much more important role in informing interpretations of state constitutional law. As Justice Anthony Kennedy noted in his 2005 decision in Roper v. Simmons, which made it unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed before the age of 18: “The opinion of the world community, while not controlling outcome, does provide respected and significant confirmation for our own conclusions.”

In Idaho, where lawyers for a homicide suspect are fighting prosecutors’ desire to include the death penalty as punishment if their client is convicted, the state constitution bans cruel and unusual punishments. Couldn’t the principle of jus cogens be raised by defense counsel as demonstrating the evolving opinion of the world community that capital punishment is morally wrong? It’s not legal precedent in Idaho, but it’s certainly relevant.

In Ohio, which is seeking to restrict public sector unions, the state constitution notes that “all powers, not herein delegated, remain with the people.” Couldn’t the right to join a labor union, noted within the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a global human right, be deemed a retained right that remains with the people of Ohio?

In short, state constitutional tools to protect increasingly vulnerable human rights are available. Now is the time that human rights advocates need to use them creatively.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-california-capitol-183300309.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 04:16:56.278929

The ACLU of Indiana, in recent years, has secured several legal victories for LGBTQ+ students in Indiana, including the right of trans students to use the correct restroom, and students’ right to form LGBTQ+-themed extracurricular clubs.

LGBTQ+ students have a right to be who they are and express themselves in public schools. Public schools have a responsibility to create a safe learning environment, and they cannot ignore harassment based on a student’s appearance or behavior.

An Indiana law, HEA 1608, requires teachers and school staff to notify a student’s parent if they request to be referred to by a different name or pronoun. The law does not require schools to get a parent's approval. Learn more about pronoun requests here. HEA 1608 also vaguely bans conversation on “human sexuality” in grades k-3, leaving teachers uncertain about what they can and cannot discuss in schools. We are currently fighting this part of HEA 1608 in the courts, and if a teacher is disciplined as a result of this law, they should reach out to the ACLU of Indiana here.

In 2025 Indiana passed a law, Senate Enrolled Act 143, that the ACLU of Indiana believes undermines the privacy rights of minors. It requires employees of state, county, or local governments to provide ""information"" about children at a parent's request. The bill does not define the term ""information,"" leaving the law open to broad interpretation.

SEA 143 will force public school teachers and other trusted adults to disclose personal and highly sensitive information to parents. It could also make students more hesitant to reach out to school staff for support if they are concerned that disclosing the information to their parents would jeopardize their safety — potentially leaving them with no one they feel comfortable confiding in.

Public schools and all schools that get federal funds are prohibited from excluding pregnant or parenting students from school, classes, or extracurricular activities, or pressuring them to drop out or change schools.

These schools must provide pregnant students the same accommodations that students with other temporary medical conditions are given, including the ability to make up missed classwork, attend doctor’s appointments, take time off for childbirth and recovery, and learn in a safe, nonjudgmental environment.

These schools are not allowed to punish a student who chooses to terminate a pregnancy or reveal a student’s private medical information.

If you’re stopped by a police officer at your school, stay calm. Ask if you’re free to leave. If the answer is yes, calmly and silently walk away from the officer. If the officer asks you a question, you have the right to remain silent. You also have the right to refuse to write or sign a statement.

You can refuse to give your consent to be searched by the police. This may not stop the search, but this is the best way to protect your rights if you end up in court.

Don’t consent to a phone search; police need a warrant to search your phone. The same goes for a strip-search. No police officer or school employee has the authority to strip-search you.

Don’t resist, fight, or flee from an officer who is arresting you. Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don’t say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer present.",https://live-awp-indiana.pantheonsite.io/app/uploads/2023/08/students_kyr_lp.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 06:00:46.653263

The building has also become a flashpoint for frequent protests, where police and federal agents have clashed with demonstrators.
Government attorneys had objected to the restraining order, arguing that complying with a broad set of requirements would hamper its ability to enforce immigration law in Illinois.
They also rebutted some claims from detainees, telling the judge that there is water on-site and some hot meals are distributed.
But he said he found the witnesses who testified to be “highly credible.” “People shouldn’t be sleeping in plastic chairs,” Gettleman said.","A federal judge on Wednesday ordered government officials to provide immigration detainees enough food, water and bed space, among other remedies, finding that conditions at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding facility in Broadview do not “pass constitutional muster.”

A day after former detainees blasted the conditions at the west suburban facility, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman issued the temporary restraining order, which he said is meant to improve circumstances at the facility while also honoring the discretion of the federal government in running its institutions.

“Based on the record currently before it, the court finds that plaintiffs and members of the putative class have suffered, and are likely to suffer, irreparable harm,” the order says.

Following hours of testimony about dirty and unsafe conditions on Tuesday, Gettleman said the building is no longer just a temporary holding facility, and clearly was not built to accommodate the influx of detainees booked during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has rained chaos on the Chicago area since September.

“It has really become a prison,” Gettleman said on Tuesday. “The conditions would be found unconstitutional even in the context of prisons holding convicted felons, but these are not convicted felons. These are civil detainees.”

The temporary restraining order followed a class-action lawsuit filed last week on behalf of two former detainees, Felipe Agustin Zamacona and Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, which alleges that a human rights crisis has been unfolding at the facility, where people are now held for days in a building without bed space or working showers.

“These are some of the most basic human necessities,” said lead attorney Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, after the hearing. “If they can’t provide it, they can’t hold people there, full stop.”

The lawsuit also accuses government officials of blocking detainees from speaking with attorneys while agents pressure people in custody to sign deportation forms rather than fight their case before an immigration judge.

The order is the first measure bringing accountability to the facility, which attorneys have said operates like a “black site” where people are disappeared with few opportunities for contact with the outside world. The building has also become a flashpoint for frequent protests, where police and federal agents have clashed with demonstrators.

According to the order, the holding rooms must be cleaned twice a day and detainees held overnight must be provided with a clean bedding mat and enough bed space to sleep.

As federal immigration authorities sweep the Chicago area, the order likely puts a limit on how many people can be held in the facility overnight, as former detainees described holding cells with no room for everyone to lay down at night to sleep.

Government attorneys had objected to the restraining order, arguing that complying with a broad set of requirements would hamper its ability to enforce immigration law in Illinois. They also rebutted some claims from detainees, telling the judge that there is water on-site and some hot meals are distributed.

But five former detainees who took the stand — including a woman who appeared via video from Honduras — described being ignored when they asked for more water. They said more than 150 people were routinely crammed into holding cells, leaving little space to try to lay on the floor to sleep.

Meals consisted of three small Subway sandwiches each day, they testified, and detainees had no privacy around the dirty and overflowing toilets, which were mostly out in the open in the holding cells.

“I don’t want anyone else to live through what I lived through,” Agustin Zamacona testified Tuesday.

The judge stopped short of granting some of the plaintiffs’ requests, such as inspections of the facility, and he said he sought to make the order as “workable as possible” with a deference to the government’s ability to run itself.

But he said he found the witnesses who testified to be “highly credible.”

“People shouldn’t be sleeping in plastic chairs,” Gettleman said. “They shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor.”

During Wednesday’s hearing, the plaintiffs’ attorneys also laid out information they are seeking as litigation continues, including lists of detainees sent to Broadview, agency policies, receipts for provisions and supplies and video footage from inside the facility.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-ice-activity-broadview001.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-05 22:17:03.060102

Authorities announced Wednesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers did not target a Chicago daycare, but were pursuing an illegal immigrant who fled into the building — after multiple reports claimed a viral video shows a teacher being dragged outside.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said ICE officers arrested Colombian national Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano — previously released at the border under the Biden administration in 2023 — after she fled into the vestibule of a building following an attempted traffic stop Wednesday morning.

While the arrest drew public criticism, authorities said it did not occur inside the daycare itself and denounced Santillana Galeano for allegedly ""recklessly endangering children"" by entering the building.

Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill, said that Santillana Galeano was a preschool teacher and was legally authorized to work in the country.

""ICE isn’t going after the worst of the worst. This morning, they took a preschool teacher without a warrant IN FRONT OF CHILDREN in my district,"" he said in a post on X.

DHS has since condemned Quigley's claims as ""deliberately misrepresenting the facts.""

Multiple DHS sources told Fox News Digital that Santillana Galeano was not targeted as a preschool teacher, but as an undocumented immigrant who had been caught and released at the border under Biden administration policies on June 26, 2023.

Officials added that she allegedly has a history of endangering minors, citing that she told her children, aged 16 and 17, to cross the border unaccompanied last month.

Every year, thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children arrive at the U.S. border, putting those children at high risk of exploitation, abuse and trafficking without parents or guardians to protect them, according to DHS.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin clarified the situation on X, noting Santillana Galeano was arrested after officers attempted a targeted traffic stop on a vehicle registered to her.

She said the car was being driven by another man, who refused to comply even as officers activated sirens and emergency lights. The vehicle reportedly sped into a shopping plaza, where the incident — captured on video — unfolded.

""Law enforcement pursued the vehicle before the assailant sped into a shopping plaza where he and the female passenger fled the vehicle,"" McLaughlin said. ""They ran into a daycare and attempted to barricade themselves inside the daycare—recklessly endangering the children inside. The illegal alien female was arrested inside a vestibule, not in the school.""

Upon her arrest, McLaughlin said Santillana Galeano provided false information about her identity and claimed she did not know the male driver, stating she had ""picked him up from a bus stop.""

Authorities have not yet released additional information about the male assailant.

President Trump’s deportation of more than half a million people, along with his ending of several programs that allowed immigrants to work in the country legally, has created labor issues across the agriculture sector, including for farmers, an important political constituency.

While experts warned mass deportation would result in agricultural labor shortages, which could then lead to food shortages, Trump officials predicted U.S.-born workers would happily fill those vacant jobs. So far, that hasn’t happened.

There has also been a lack of movement by the Trump administration and his congressional allies toward creating a viable, long-term solution for the immigration system.

Corporate agriculture has often pursued lax safety standards, few labor protections and low wages. In many cases, only immigrants and undocumented workers are willing to toil long hours in extremely hot fields and to cut animal carcasses in hazardous meatpacking plants.

In recent months, to increase the number of farmworkers in the country, the administration has tinkered with the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for months at a time. The administration said it has streamlined the process to apply to bring workers to the U.S., and it’s trying to allow farmers to pay foreign visa workers less.

But full-scale reforms — the kind industry groups say are necessary — have not yet materialized, even as the administration ramps up immigration enforcement. Also, some agricultural industries, such as dairy, are not eligible to hire through the program.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

While the Trump administration is relying on the H-2A program to help a vital voting bloc, its approach to government funding has also created problems for those who need it.

As Trump and his congressional allies battled over federal funding with Democrats, the government shut down Oct. 1. That day, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the H-2A program, said a funding lapse resulted in the program’s suspension.

“A prolonged lapse of funding,” the labor department stated in a notice, “will exacerbate processing delays … especially” for the H-2A program.

In mid-October, more than two weeks into the shutdown, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins saying the delays “imminently threaten agricultural production,” according to Civil Eats. The association did not respond to a request for comment. (On Oct. 31, the labor department updated its contingency plan for operating during the shutdown to include employees who process H-2A visas, according to Politico.)

While farmers are dealing with roadblocks to one labor source, the Trump administration continues to crack down on another.

Out of about 2 million farmworkers in the U.S., government surveys show about 44% are undocumented. Hundreds of thousands of others in the food supply chain — meatpacking plants, grocery stores, restaurants — are also undocumented.

Trump’s policies have also created more undocumented immigrants in the country. He ended humanitarian parole programs that allowed immigrants escaping unsafe environments to work in the U.S. The move left some meatpacking plants without a reliable labor pool.

Immigration raids, or the threat of them, have led to worker shortages across the country. In Pennsylvania, some dairy farmers, who often have to rely on undocumented laborers, have sold off their herds because they could not find any interested workers, according to Politico. In California this summer, some fields were not harvested because many workers stayed home, according to Reuters. In Idaho, similar concerns pervade farm country.

It’s difficult to know exactly how many undocumented farmworkers have left the labor force, but the country has seen a decline in immigrant workers overall. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, estimated in August. The decline in the immigrant workforce is likely to reduce the overall labor force, which could harm the country’s economy, according to CNBC.

The cumulative effect of the Trump administration’s actions will likely lead to fewer small farms and a trend toward larger industrial-sized farms, which will have the ability to access visa workes and explore options for mechanization, said Mary Jo Dudley, former director of the Cornell Farmworker Program and current director of Migrant Advocacy and Support.

“As more people are detained, farms are going to lose workers,” she said. “Dairy producers who don’t have access to H-2A workers are faced with hard decisions: Should they just sell their cows if their workers are going to disappear any day? The possibilities for small family farms are quickly slipping away.”

Despite Farmer Concerns, Immigration Raids Continue

For months, Trump has said a solution is in the works. During a July 4 speech, he said, “We have some great stuff being written.”

However, Trump’s main goal and the platform he ran on — mass deportation — has always taken precedence.

Over the summer, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms, citing farmers’ concerns, according to the New York Times. A few days later, raids resumed. Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide, has told the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the home of ICE, it needs to arrest 3,000 people a day, according to Axios.

In mid-September, Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, told local TV station WWNY that “there are discussions going on now” about raids affecting farm labor. But he made clear the increased enforcement would continue.

“President has said there won’t be amnesty,” Homan said. “But he is looking at options for farms.”

In early October, the administration itself acknowledged its immigration crackdown was causing worker shortages and, potentially, food shortages.

The acknowledgment is tied to how visa workers are paid. Farmers employing H-2A workers are supposed to pay what’s called the “adverse effect wage rate,” or AEWR. The rate is purposefully set above a state’s minimum wage to incentivize farmers to hire U.S. residents, not foreign nationals.

But in a proposed rule filed Oct. 2, the labor department argued the rate needs to be cut. That’s because the “current and imminent labor shortage exacerbated by the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens, increased enforcement of existing immigration law, and global competitiveness pressures … presents a sufficient risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

The labor department did not respond to a request for comment on the statement in the proposed rule. When a spokeswoman was contacted via email, she said she’d have to wait to respond until the government shutdown was over.

Despite Farmer Concerns, Immigration Raids Continue

The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.

“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” she said over the summer to the Western Governors Association. “I can just tell you, none of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Her comment stands in contrast to other Trump officials, who have consistently said the objective is to replace immigrant farmworkers with U.S.-born workers. About two weeks after Chavez-DeRemer’s comments, Rollins contradicted her.

She said Medicaid participants, who often physically cannot work but now face expanded work requirements under a new Trump policy, would fill the gap left by immigrants.

“The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way, and we move the workforce towards automation and 100% American participation,” Rollins said, according to Politico. “With 34 million people, able-bodied adults on Medicaid, we should be able to do that fairly quickly.” (Before Rollins became agriculture secretary, she told Congress that labor shortages from increased enforcement were a “hypothetical” issue.)

When asked whether Rollins’ position had changed, given the Labor Department’s stance on the immigration crackdown, the USDA, in an unattributed comment, said Trump was “strengthening the farm workforce and streamlining” the H-2A program.

With Congress in Recess, No Deliberation on Possible Labor Solutions

The agriculture committee in the U.S. House of Representatives has studied the H-2A program, and last year it offered a template for reforms.

Currently, employers — or specialty firms that employers hire — must file paperwork with three federal departments to bring foreign farmworkers to the U.S. The committee recommended creating a single portal for employers to use. It also suggested lowering how much employers spend on wages and housing.

This summer, a bill was introduced based on the template, but it has not received a committee hearing.

The House has not convened since Sept. 19, and it’s unclear when it will resume. U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and the body’s speaker, has faced criticism from his own party for the long delay, according to The Hill. While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.

With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the White House, Investigate Midwest contacted all 30 Republicans on the House agriculture committee to understand their perspective on how the shutdown is affecting a possible labor solution for farmers hurt by increased immigration enforcement.

However, most did not respond, and a few said they would not comment. The chair of the agriculture committee, Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Dol Creates New Office, Unclear if Old Issues Addressed

The Trump administration has sought to curtail other visas and legal statuses in its effort to severely limit the number of immigrants in the country, but it has backed expanding the H-2A program, which is only for agricultural employers.

In addition to ending humanitarian parole programs, the administration has proposed requiring employers who hire through the H-1B program to pay a $100,000 fee per application. H-1B holders are considered “highly skilled” immigrants who work in high-paying industries, such as tech. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued over the fee.

On the other hand, H-2A farmworkers are typically paid slightly more than minimum wage for jobs that don’t last long, and wage theft is a well-documented problem.

The Trump administration could be attempting to replace many undocumented farmworkers with foreigners who spend just months at a time in the U.S., said Daniel Costa, a lead immigration researcher at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute.

“Basically, they’re saying, ‘We want workers, but we don’t want people,’” he said.

This summer, the DOL created a new office it said would help increase the number of farmers participating in the H-2A program. However, it’s unclear how the office is addressing issues created by the program’s popularity.

During the June speech to governors of western states, Chavez-DeRemer, the labor secretary, said she was creating a “one-stop shop” for the H-2A program. The new office would help address a backlog of applications, as well as speed up approvals for farmers who need workers quickly, she said, according to The Packer.

“We’re finally going to lean in,” she said, “and then we’ll work with Congress on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

The new office, named the Office of Immigration Policy, will set “strategic oversight,” “strategic management” and “strategic priority” for visa programs, according to Chavez-DeRemer’s memo.

The man tapped to run the office, Brian Pasternak, has worked as a civil servant at the labor department for more than 20 years. Most recently, he oversaw the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which processes and approves H-2A visa applications submitted by employers.

Even before the current shutdown, the labor certification office struggled to keep pace with the increasingly high demand for H-2A workers, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office report.

Staff members were shifted from their regular responsibilities to processing H-2A applications, which led to longer processing times for other visas. As the number of applications increased, regulators also dinged employers for fewer infractions, such as lacking proof of adequate housing, a longtime problem for farmworkers on visas.

Having enough staff was an issue before Trump assumed office, and it’s unclear if staffing cuts by Elon Musk’s DOGE affected the processing of H-2A applications.

The labor department lost about 1% of its workforce in DOGE’s initial purge, according to The New York Times, and more cuts could be coming during the government shutdown.

The labor department did not respond to a question about how many staffers handling H-2A applications were fired or took early retirement since January. It also did not respond when asked how it plans to handle the issues the Government Accountability Office identified.

The new office “will support President Trump’s efforts to prevent illegal immigration by helping employers access and navigate these programs – supporting legal pathways to work,” said Courtney Parella, a labor department spokeswoman. “By establishing the (Office of Immigration Policy), which reports directly to the Secretary, the Department is cutting red tape and streamlining its ability to execute immigration-related policy priorities and administer foreign labor certification programs.”

Boatright, with the American Farm Bureau, said the labor department’s new office holds a lot of promise. However, at least so far, little has changed on the ground.

“No news yet,” he said, “but we’re anxious to see what this Office of Immigration Policy can do.”",https://sentientmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Story-Images-2-6.png,N,,2025-11-06 07:19:23.578585

Tucson center opened to support migrants Immigrants face multiple challenges in the U.S., even without ICE agents outside their door.","The Trump administration has built an immigrant enforcement machine on a scale never seen before in America. ICE agents are reaching into workspaces, communities and even the health care system to enforce harmful immigration policies, upending people’s lives.

Sarah Kimball, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Health Center at Boston Medical Center, has treated patients whose lives and health have been turned upside down by U.S. immigration practices.

“This a dark and frightening time for immigrant people (in America),” Kimball said Tuesday at APHA 2025’s session “Horrific Attacks on Immigrants and Refugees: Protecting Our Communities and Fighting Back.”

Federal and state immigrant policies have changed the landscape of health access, trust and care for immigrants and refugees, said Kimball, who calls for health care providers treating immigrants to advocate for their patients’ health rights.

Kimball offered best practices for immigrant health care services. While ICE agents can enter public spaces, agents without a warrant are legally not allowed to conduct their business in private spaces, which includes health care waiting rooms, she said. The Boston Medical Center’s immigrant health waiting room prominently displays a sign saying, “Our waiting room is a private patient care area. Only patients and those accompanying patients are permitted to enter.”

Though the sign may seem an innocuous gesture, it can be effective because it openly and plainly designates the area as safe space and can cause ICE agents to at least think twice before performing any action, Kimball said.

Confidentiality of medical records are protected in U.S. law, but immigration officials can sometimes obtain the records through legal processes. To make their work a little harder, Kimball recommends that clinical staff avoid using words and phrases such as “undocumented,” “Illegal” and “without papers” in reports on immigrant patients. This can mitigate risk of immigration status-related disclosure.

By law, health care clinics cannot share personal medical information with other entities, including immigration officials. Immigrants on Medicaid rolls or receiving other government-funded benefits need to know this, Kimball said.

Though in July the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shared Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement purposes, a federal judge in August issued a preliminary injunction blocking the sharing of Medicaid data with immigration authorities in the 20 states that joined the lawsuit.

No additional risk arises for immigrants by continuing to be on government-funded health programs because DHS already has the household’s address from the original sign-up, Kimball said. Dropping off Medicaid and other government-funded services won’t erase the data immigrants have already provided, and keeping the benefits helps ensure health and well-being.

Conversations like this can build trust between care professional and patient, Kimball said, showing that the professional supports immigrants’ legal right to health care.

“We have to proactively fight if we want any trust with immigrant refugees,” Kimball said.

Tucson center opened to support migrants

Immigrants face multiple challenges in the U.S., even without ICE agents outside their door. Through a multi-year grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Southeast Arizona Health Education Center in Tucson opened a center to support migrants. The Community Health Advocates for Migrant Population Services, which operated 2022–2025, served migrants who had requested asylum and needed to decompress before continuing their journey in the states, said Taylor Leigh, a community health worker at Southeast Arizona Health Education Center.

The program offered health care education and services, especially important because some migrants have their medicines for chronic ailments confiscated at the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrants are also referred to food banks, Head Start programs, adult English classes and other services.

The program bridged a public health gap for people with limited funds and work skills and no health coverage newly arriving in the country, Leigh said. The work was successful because it treated migrants with dignity.

“Care becomes possible only when relationships are built on empathy, consistency and respect,” she said.

Unfortunately, the current administration has rescinded CDC’s grant for the program. After four years, the Community Health Advocates for Migrant Population Services is no more.

The temporary restraining order that he issued on Wednesday will remain in effect until Nov. 19, when he will hold another hearing in the case.
The plaintiffs who brought the class-action lawsuit have argued conditions at the ICE facility are inhumane and require court intervention.","A federal judge on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order requiring federal authorities to improve sanitary conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, while also guaranteeing detainees contact with their attorneys.

The order requires ICE to provide detainees at Broadview with clean bedding and sufficient space to sleep if they are held overnight; a shower at least every other day; clean toilet facilities; three full meals per day; a bottle of water with each meal; adequate supplies of soap, toilet paper, and other hygiene products; and menstrual products and prescribed medications.

""People shouldn't be sleeping next to overflowing toilets,"" U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said. ""They should not be sleeping on top of each other.""

Holding cells also must be cleaned at least twice a day, and detainees must be provided free and private phone calls with their attorneys. Detainees also must be given a list of pro bono attorneys in English and Spanish upon arrival at the facility, along with interpreter services if needed. Detainees also must be listed on ICE's online detainee locator system as soon as they arrive at the Broadview facility.

Gettleman listened to several hours of testimony on Tuesday about conditions inside the Broadview facility, and said he was convinced the building meant to hold detainees for a matter of hours has essentially become a prison, calling the conditions inside ""unnecessarily cruel.""

The temporary restraining order that he issued on Wednesday will remain in effect until Nov. 19, when he will hold another hearing in the case.

The judge ordered Trump administration attorneys to provide him with a status report by noon on Friday on their efforts to comply with his order.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs also asked for video footage from inside the Broadview facility to get a better sense of the conditions, but were told by Trump administration lawyers that a span of about 10 days of video footage from last month was deleted.

""I think the video evidence, especially given the fact we don't have an inspection yet, is essential,"" said Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center's Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit. ""It is pretty wild to me that there is missing footage from the 19th of October to the 31st of October, and that covers the time our clients were in Broadview. I don't have a lot of words to say about that, other than it's suspect.""

Attorneys for the government said the footage was deleted while they attempted to retrieve video for a different lawsuit.

The plaintiffs who brought the class-action lawsuit have argued conditions at the ICE facility are inhumane and require court intervention.

At Tuesday's hearing, five people who had been detained in Broadview testified that it was overcrowded; that there wasn't adequate food, medical care, or sleeping conditions; and that they could not access showers, soap, or other hygiene items.

They testified that people have had to sleep on the floor or in plastic chairs with only a plastic blanket. The plaintiffs further alleged, among other things, that toilets are overflowing with human waste, and that the waste has accumulated around toilets where people had to sleep.

The facility is designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours, but since the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Chicago area began, often has held some migrants for days.

Detainees also have said that they were coerced into signing documents that they did not understand, and their attorneys have said they were not allowed proper access to legal representation.

The lawsuit claimed agents at the facility ""cut off detainees from the outside world,"" which the government has denied.

Gettleman said he found the witnesses presented highly credible evidence, and that he tried to issue a temporary restraining order that recognizes what it's like to run such a facility while also maintaining people's constitutional rights.

The plaintiffs had urged Gettleman to issue an even more sweeping restraining order that would have gone even farther than Gettleman's mandate – including specific limits on how many people could be kept in holding rooms or cells, and more frequent cleaning of holding areas. The plaintiffs' attorneys also wanted Gettleman to allow them to conduct their own regular inspections of the facility, alongside an expert and photographer.

If those conditions could not be met within three days, the plaintiffs wanted a restriction placed on holding any detainees in Broadview for more than 12 hours. But those limits were not included in Gettleman's order.

Government lawyers had argued that the sweeping restrictions the plaintiffs had sought would ""halt the government's ability to enforce immigration law in Illinois.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/08/92ec05b0-4bad-425c-9eb4-bf3dd324c105/thumbnail/1200x630/63e65d1f226c2f8a656d44a5d9ad07f1/ap25267733241861.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 20:00:58.673236

Under the jail enforcement model, county jail staff can question people in the jail about their immigration status and the county can hold non-citizens in jail for up to 48 hours to be picked up by federal agents.

Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, ICE has been working to significantly expand the program across the country. Marathon is the fifth sheriff’s department in Wisconsin to sign an agreement with ICE this year, increasing the total from nine to 14. The Palmyra police department has also signed an agreement with the agency.

“By applying to participate in the 287(g) program, the Marathon County Sheriff is offering to have his department be turned into an arm of ICE’s deportation machine,” the ACLU of Wisconsin said in a statement. “The 287(g) program is notorious for leading to racial profiling, unconstitutional policing, and wrongful detention of US citizens — and it makes communities less safe. People are less likely to seek help and report crime when their local law enforcement is seen as a partner with ICE, and going to the authorities could mean that they, a family member or a friend could be deported.”

Aside from 287(g), the Dodge County sheriff’s office has a contract with the federal government to hold federal detainees at the county jail. That agreement includes holding migrants on behalf of ICE and sometimes transporting them to and from out-of-state facilities such as the controversial ICE processing center in Broadview, Ill.

Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant advocacy group, said the sheriff, Chad Billeb, should have engaged with the community before deciding to sign the agreement.

“Sheriff Chad Billeb, as an elected official, should not have signed this agreement without engaging the community and local leaders in a transparent, democratic process that ensures accountability and information sharing.

“Good government depends on strong leadership that can effectively manage the federal budget,” James-Christian Blockwood, NAPA’s president and CEO, said Wednesday.
Reforming pay for federal employees under funding lapses has also become a key part of the shutdown conversation.
In October, lawmakers introduced various proposals attempting to immediately pay federal employees while the shutdown continues.
“We are seeing a layer cake of trauma, incident after incident that [federal employees are] all experiencing,” Stier said.","The current shutdown has officially made history as the longest funding lapse the federal government has ever endured — and the impacts are widespread.

About 1.4 million federal employees who are either excepted or furloughed are on track to miss a second paycheck at the end of this week. Many federal services are shut down, and rising absences among excepted employees are leading to further delays and closures.

On top of that, the Trump administration has been threatening reductions in force and questioning the legal guarantee of back pay for furloughed workers. For many federal employees, it all makes the current lapse in appropriations unlike any other.

Recent research from the Partnership for Public Service found that about half of Americans are seeing the shutdown’s impacts firsthand in their communities, most commonly through travel delays and facility closures.

But Max Stier, the Partnership’s president and CEO, said even bigger harms from the shutdown will be felt for the long-haul.

“Our future capacity is going to be diminished substantially,” Stier told reporters during a press briefing Wednesday. “You’re going to see that across the board, whether you talk about air traffic controllers or VA doctors or food inspectors. So many of the functions of our government are highly skilled professionals that require long-term investment.”

In the wake of setting the record for the longest-ever shutdown, some organizations are turning the conversation toward the need for long-term reforms in the appropriations process, and the need for better governing in the future.

The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), a congressionally chartered non-profit that focuses on government management reforms, urged Congress to pass legislation to modernize what’s become a dated budget process for the federal government.

“Good government depends on strong leadership that can effectively manage the federal budget,” James-Christian Blockwood, NAPA’s president and CEO, said Wednesday.

To avoid future harms of shutdowns, NAPA also called for lawmakers to consider changing the timing of the budget cycle in government, as well as requiring Congress to stay in session until appropriations are enacted.

“This shutdown represents a failure in our budget process at a time when public trust in government is already unacceptably low,” Blockwood said. “This cannot and should not continue.”

There have been at least some attempts in Congress this year to end the possibility of shutdowns once and for all. In September, lawmakers introduced various bills, including the Eliminate Shutdowns Act, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act and the End Government Shutdowns Act. Each would operate slightly differently, but all aim to force Congress into a continuing resolution, rather than a shutdown, in the absence of a spending agreement.

Stier said that type of change would “encourage members to actually come together and do their work … and not make those who have no responsibility for [a shutdown] bear the significant price.”

“No other country does it this way — and it’s not a compliment,” he added.

Reforming pay for federal employees under funding lapses has also become a key part of the shutdown conversation. Although both furloughed and excepted federal employees are supposed to be ensured back pay under a 2019 law, the Office of Management and Budget has called into question whether furloughed employees are automatically guaranteed that compensation. Many lawmakers, attorneys and unions harshly criticized the administration’s new position, and said the law was clear in its intent.

When asked again this week if the Trump administration would guarantee back pay for furloughed employees, as required by the 2019 law, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not provide a definitive answer.

“This is something we are very much open to discussing with Democrats, as part of the discussions about the continuing resolution to keep the government open,” Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. “It’s something that Republicans are talking with Democrats about right now.”

Another possibility for long-term reform includes paying federal employees immediately, even throughout a shutdown, rather than only paying them once a funding lapse ends. Stier said back pay should already be guaranteed for all federal employees, but immediate pay would be the better solution.

“There is no other workforce in our country that has that burden to bear, and they should not have to bear it,” Stier said.

In October, lawmakers introduced various proposals attempting to immediately pay federal employees while the shutdown continues. But due to disagreements over the inclusion of furloughed employees, as well as whether to prevent the administration from conducting RIFs, the legislation failed in the Senate. Congressional aides have confirmed that bipartisan discussions on the legislation remain ongoing, but progress is unclear.

Other areas that may be ripe for change include the possibility of withholding pay for members of Congress during a shutdown, as well as requiring Congress to remain in session until lawmakers reach an agreement on appropriations.

Regardless, whenever the current shutdown does end, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees return to work, Stier said it will be a return to high workloads and low morale for many.

“We are seeing a layer cake of trauma, incident after incident that [federal employees are] all experiencing,” Stier said. “As a result, many talented people have already thrown in the towel, and many more are likely to do so.”

The employee ran from a vehicle into the Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center after officers pulled into the parking lot right after her, Alderman Matt Martin said, citing witness accounts. The employee was detained at the entry while telling authorities she has papers, he said. Authorities went inside to question several people around 7 a.m., when the facility opened, according to witnesses.

It was unusual even under “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has resulted in more than 3,000 immigration arrests in the Chicago area since early September. Agents have rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter in a middle-of-the night apartment building raid, appeared with overwhelming force in recreational areas and launched tear gas amid protests.

Several officers wore clothing Wednesday that read “POLICE ICE,” identifying them as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Martin. Video circulating online showed at least one officer in a vest that said “ICE” as the woman was restrained and taken away.

“ICE law enforcement did NOT target a Daycare. Officers attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop of this female illegal alien from Colombia,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an online post. “Officers attempted to pull over this vehicle, which was registered to a female illegal alien, with sirens and emergency lights, but the male driver refused to pull the vehicle over.”

At a news conference Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley said the employee had a work permit and agents followed her into the school without a warrant.

“They didn’t just walk in chasing one person. They went into multiple rooms asking and looking for teachers while children were present,” U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez said at the news conference.

Rayito de Sol, which operates eight locations in Illinois and Minnesota, did not respond to a request for comment. Following the incident, its school on the north side of Chicago closed for the day.

Parents gathered outside the preschool looking angered and dismayed.

Esmeralda Rosales, whose husband dropped off their 9-month-old child, rushed from work to show support for the staff. She said the woman detained was her child’s teacher.

“These are the nicest, kindest people. They don’t deserve, these children don’t deserve to be living through this,” she said.

Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old also is taught by the woman detained, said the operation came “at the school during the busiest time of drop-off where kids and families have to witness a teacher being forcibly removed and agents kitted up in tactical gear.”

Adam Gonzalez was dropping off his child when he saw people yelling and federal immigration officers in body armor outside the school. Something didn’t feel right to him, he said, so he began recording the worker’s detention.

“The world needs to see what’s happening, that this is not fake, that this is real,” Gonzalez said.

“In Chicago, it seems like you’re only one or two degrees of separation from someone who’s had an ICE experience at this point,” said Rayito parent Jason Wirth, who was on the way to drop off his child. “These are people who are intended to protect us, and I think we feel preyed upon instead.”

Immigration authorities have in recent months provoked an outcry for operating near schools, especially during the hectic hours of dropping off or picking up children.

In July, agents confronted a man in the parking lot of his child’s preschool in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, with many preschoolers looking on. In Los Angeles, agents handcuffed a disabled teen outside a high school campus, later releasing him when they discovered they had the wrong person. In Chicago, agents last month released tear gas that engulfed an elementary school playground where children had been playing.

Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official who has become a face of the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles and Chicago, has staunchly defended the administration’s tactics in the face of threats and protests.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” he said in an interview Monday.

Many presidents have enacted strict immigration policies, but the Trump administration is unique in its aggressive “us vs them” mentality of immigration policy.
Immigration wasn’t always a partisan issue, but the Trump era of aggressive immigration policy pits people against each other.","Stricter immigration policy doesn’t protect the American economy or support the future of the country. The U.S. is a country founded on the migration of people from around the world, which is why it’s called a “melting pot” of different cultures, all considering themselves American. Immigration is a divisive issue, but some politicians from different parties can agree over immigration policy. For example, the Dignity Act, which provides legal status for some undocumented immigrants, received bipartisan support. But President Donald Trump’s administration is moving away from the concept that has defined America and is polarizing stances toward immigration policy.

Though he claims to be protecting Americans from immigrants involved in gangs and crime, Trump’s crackdown on immigration is altering a value that is so vital to the nation; the U.S. is a country made up of immigrants, and without them, diversity shrinks, humanitarianism falters and the U.S. loses its founding principle of immigration. Moderate immigration policy — like those that combine border security with expanded pathways to legal status — should be an issue that both Republicans and Democrats can agree upon because the country was built on the relocation of these people. But as a whole, immigration is not a bipartisan issue.

Proponents of strict immigration policy, such as Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security,argue that immigrants take jobs away from Americans, and because of this, supporting immigration is anti-American. But this isn’t the case. In fact, immigrants foster economic growth in the U.S. by filling gaps in the labor force without taking jobs from citizens. They are expected to boost real gross domestic product by 2% within the next decade. Without immigrants, the American job market would fall apart.

There are policies that appeal to the bottom lines of both parties. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, and U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., introduced the Equal Access to Green cards for Legal Employment Act in 2021. The act reduces the backlog of attaining a green card, especially for highly educated immigrants who come from smaller countries. With a Green Card, immigrants are able to fill necessary jobs in the U.S. and increase American productivity, attracting Republicans in favor of business efficiency. It also supports easier pathways to permanent residency in the U.S. independent of national origin, appealing to Democrats who defend workers’ rights. This act is one of many possible policies that both parties can agree on. Policymakers must explore legislation that appeals to both major parties in order to support human rights initiatives and prioritize American values.

During his second term in office, Trump has emphasized a strict immigration policy, specifically limiting access to citizenship and conducting mass deportations. The first few months after his inauguration are characterized by his rare reimplementation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law that gives the president authority to swiftly deport and detain immigrants in wartime. Trump weaponized a law that had not been used since World War II to deport Venezuelan migrants, supposedly associated with a Venezuelan gang, to a prison in El Salvador. They were accused of crimes without evidence and unlawfully held in prison for months. Prisoners endured violence and unsafe conditions, and their families were left without any communication from U.S. forces. Republicans and Democrats can disagree on policy issues, but torture should cross a line. Except it doesn’t. The Supreme Court ordered in April that the administration stop employing this act, though they still condone immigration raids and racist practices.

Democrats are not innocent of enabling torture tactics either. Democratic leaders, such as then former President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were outspoken supporters of the former President George Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The invasion led to the torture of tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis in prisons for years. They endured physical and psychological abuse and have yet to receive any compensation from the U.S., nor has Bush or his administration apologized for their inhumane treatment of the Iraqi people. Following the end of the American occupation of Iraq, former President Barack Obama failed to hold the previous administration accountable in any way. Both parties are complicit in the torture of innocent Iraqis, but there is a possible future in which Americans, regardless of party affiliation, can protect human rights around the world.

Temporary Protected Status, a subset of the Immigration Act of 1990, provides asylum for foreign nationals in the U.S. for 18 months in the event of an environmental or political catastrophe in their home country. The act does not receive the same bipartisan support it once did. On Oct. 3, the Supreme Court approved the termination of TPS for more than 300,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S., uprooting them from their lives in America and placing them in the dangers they had once escaped. TPS is one of the few pathways to safety for many refugees, and the Trump administration seeks to end these protections for as many immigrants as possible.

Many presidents have enacted strict immigration policies, but the Trump administration is unique in its aggressive “us vs them” mentality of immigration policy. Within the first 100 days in office, the Trump administration arrested more than 66,000 migrants and deported almost the exact same amount. Opposing parties can come to the same conclusion on immigration policy, but Trump brings a completely new perspective, and it’s not beneficial to anyone, even Americans.

Immigration wasn’t always a partisan issue, but the Trump era of aggressive immigration policy pits people against each other. Politics dependent on polarization — regardless of the topic — have little room for progress because people are unwilling to consider opposing viewpoints. The Trump administration, especially during his second term, is determined to remove immigrants from the country and, in doing so, is unwilling to meet in the middle on the issue. Policymakers must represent the beliefs of the electorate, and must forgo their intense focus on extreme policies.

If there is broad support for restricting legal immigration into the U.S., then the Trump administration, and other policymakers for that matter, are doing a good job — but this is not the case. Cracking down on legal immigration and suppressing pathways to citizenship and safety is anti-American, and both parties have a history of overlooking or executing inhumane tactics to reach their bottom lines. It’s time to return to the concept that laid the foundation for the U.S. and support legal pathways to citizenship that bring a prosperous future to the American economy.

Around 230 South Sudanese nationals are currently approved to live and work in the United States through the program, known as Temporary Protected Status, according to a department estimate.

The program, which allows foreign nationals to live temporarily in the United States when conditions in their home countries would make returning unsafe, was first authorized for South Sudanese nationals in 2011. The country’s designation expired on Monday.

People with status through the program will have about 60 days to leave the country before the termination is effective, according to the notice.

“Under the previous administration, Temporary Protected Status was abused to allow violent terrorists, criminals and national security threats into our nation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. “T.P.S. was never designed to be permanent.”

The Obama administration first authorized T.P.S. for South Sudanese nationals, saying the designation was warranted because of ongoing armed conflict. Since then, the program has been extended multiple times. After several years of civil war, a peace agreement was signed in 2018.

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security said that “renewed peace in South Sudan” and “improved diplomatic relations” justified the end of the program.

In recent weeks, though, the United Nations has warned of escalating armed clashes in South Sudan and food insecurity that is “widespread and deepening” in parts of the country.

The termination is the latest effort by the Trump administration to end temporary deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants living in the United States. Administration officials have also ended T.P.S. designations for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

Some of those efforts have prompted concern that migrants could be returning to unstable countries. After the administration ended T.P.S. for Syrians in September, critics said they worried that conditions in Syria were still dangerous, warranting an extension of the program.

Federal officials have also ended other temporary programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the country lawfully, including a Biden-era program that gave protections to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/05/multimedia/05dc-tps-tgkc/05dc-tps-tgkc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:17:25.441096

It’s regrettable.” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, another Republican committee member, said he had greater concern with hamstringing immigration enforcement efforts as opposed to wrongful dentition.","President Donald Trump’s immigration policies have led to increasingly visible incidents of U.S. citizens being caught up in wrongful detention, and Democratic members of Congress say the administration has not responded to requests for information about the number of incidents.

Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said indiscriminate enforcement of immigration law under the Trump administration that wraps up citizens and noncitizens alike “continues to be a real danger.”

“We’re just continuing to get reports of people in New Jersey who are being just rounded up,” Kim said. “And just across this country, we’re seeing reports of U.S. citizens getting brought into this and there’s been no actions that I’ve seen from this administration after what we’ve been pushing for in terms of transparency and accountability, no actions that I’ve seen in which they’re trying to rein this in or trying to change some of those practices.”

Two Democrats — Rep. Robert Garcia of California, ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, ranking member on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations — asked the Department of Homeland Security in an Oct. 20 letter for the total number of U.S. citizens detained and a list of all U.S. citizens held for more than 24 hours.

“The impact of these arrests has not been evenly distributed across the country, and cities like Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have been targeted heavily by ICE and CBP,” Garcia and Blumenthal wrote, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. “Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling — particularly of Latinos — which has been well documented in Los Angeles.”

In a separate effort, Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, and Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, ranking member on the panel’s Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement, wrote to the Trump administration in an Oct. 20 letter demanding answers on numbers and a potential change in policy.

“DHS and ICE continue to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens — sometimes with violent force — while failing to investigate these cases with the urgency and care required,” the letter states.

A report last month from investigative news outlet ProPublica created an unofficial tally and found more than 170 incidents of agents holding U.S. citizens against their will in the first nine months of the Trump administration.

Several Democrats said they are frustrated by the Trump administration’s intransigence in not being forthcoming with the information as reports of wrongful dentition continue to intensify, despite efforts in outreach to the Department of Homeland Security.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Trump administration is “virtually unresponsive” to inquiries about its efforts to limit wrongful detention or keep track of the tally.

Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he has received no indication the Trump administration has sought to monitor wrongful detention, and Democrats are “still waiting to hear back” on inquiries.

DHS, when asked about the issue, responded with an email that said the department “responds to official correspondence through official channels.”

“DHS does NOT arrest and deport U.S. citizens,” the department email said. “This garbage is contributing to our law enforcement officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults and 8000% increase in death threats against them. Democrats should get back to Washington, do their jobs, and reopen the government.”

Concerns over wrongful detention are part of broader criticisms of the Trump administration’s use of force in its immigration enforcement, including the deployment of the National Guard to assist in enforcement despite objections from local leaders and the use of racial profiling when arresting migrants allegedly in the United States unlawfully.

Alabama lawsuit

One high-profile lawsuit on wrongful detention of an Alabama construction worker who says he was detained on two separate occasions despite showing a valid ID continues to unfold.

Attorneys representing Leonardo Garcia Venegas, the Baldwin County, Ala.-based American citizen and construction worker, have asked the judge for a ruling that would limit certain immigration enforcement actions within the judge’s jurisdiction as the case moves forward.

“The government can’t treat innocent American citizens (and other lawful residents) like criminals just for going to work,” the filing says. “The Fourth Amendment, and federal regulations that restrict immigration officers’ search-and-seizure powers, demand better.”

Among the limits sought in the brief are restrictions on searching nonpublic areas of construction sites without a warrant and detaining workers even after they show evidence of lawful presence in the United States, such as a Real ID.

The litigation, which seeks class-action certification in addition to damages to Garcia Venegas for violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, is currently before the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Alabama.

Garcia Venegas’ lawsuit states the first incident of detention took place on May 21 after he got within 25 feet of immigration officers while trying to film on his iPhone the arrest of his brother, who is undocumented. The second incident took place on June 12 when immigration officials removed Garcia Venegas from his worksite and detained him for about 20 to 30 minutes even after he showed his Real ID, the lawsuit says.

DHS defended its actions against Garcia Venegas in a fact sheet delivered to the media upon the publication of an article on him in The New York Times.

“During a targeted worksite operation, Garcia Venegas attempted to obstruct and prevent the lawful arrest of an illegal alien,” the fact sheet says. “He physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands. Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

Maria Greeley, a U.S. citizen born in Illinois, was confronted earlier this month in Chicago by three federal agents outside her workplace who “restrained her, placing her hands behind her back and securing them with zip ties,” even though she was able to produce a passport showing U.S. citizenship, according to an article last month in Newsweek.

The agents, Greeley said, dispute the authenticity of her passport on the basis she “doesn’t look like” the family name on her passport, the report says.

Republican response

Senate Republicans shrugged off reports of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens as overblown and the unfortunate consequence of needed efforts for immigration enforcement after President Joe Biden oversaw the admission of tens of millions of migrants into the United States.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., completely discounted the idea that U.S. citizens were caught up in immigration enforcement when asked if he was concerned about the developments.

In response to a question about Garcia Venegas, who is a constituent of Tuberville in Alabama, as an example of wrongful detention of a U.S. citizen, Tuberville professed he “hadn’t heard about it.”

Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a Republican and member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, downplayed the arrests as an unavoidable consequence of law enforcement.

“All I would say is that it’s not uncommon to have a situation where there’s an arrest and people are actually picked up and within hours, or within 24 hours, they determine, hey, that this person’s not actually either a suspect, or this person is actually legally present,” Lankford said.

Lankford also questioned whether similar numbers of wrongful arrests are present in other law enforcement activities, or if the number of wrongful detentions in immigration enforcement were any different during the Biden and Obama administrations.

GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, also a member of the Senate Homeland Security panel, blamed the Biden administration and the media for creating the environment leading to incidents of wrongful detention in immigration enforcement.

“That’s because the Biden administration created such an enormous mess and you guys didn’t report on that,” Johnson said. “So it’s not going to be perfect trying to clean up an enormous mess started by the Biden administration. It’s regrettable.”

Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, another Republican committee member, said he had greater concern with hamstringing immigration enforcement efforts as opposed to wrongful dentition.

“I think no one wants a U.S. citizen to be improperly detained,” Scott said. “So I don’t want that to happen, but I want ICE to do their job and get rid of all the criminals and terrorists and the people selling drugs to our kids.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241446569.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:17:06.435646

“This Court simply cannot issue in this habeas action the orders Alawieh hopes to obtain,” Sorokin wrote on Oct. 31.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging the deportation of a doctor from Lebanon who was deported from Boston's Logan Airport earlier this year despite having a visa after immigration officials said she supported a Hezbollah leader and attended his funeral.

In March, Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist at Brown University, was detained for at least 36 hours in Boston's airport after arriving from Lebanon. The doctor was traveling with her family, and while traveling, she attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the former leader of Hezbollah.

Homeland Security officials say they reviewed her phone while Alawieh was detained and found photos of “Hezbollah fighters and martyrs."" Alawieh responded that she was only interested in Nasrallah's spiritual beliefs, but she confirmed that some of her family supported his politics.

Alawieh's case quickly gained national attention as her family launched a legal campaign to keep her in the U.S. At one point, a federal judge ordered that she not be removed until a hearing could be held, but lawyers have said customs officials did not get word until after Alawieh was sent back to Lebanon.

Late last month, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin dismissed Alawieh's case, arguing that he did not have the authority to provide relief she sought — in particular, saying that he could not remove a five-year ban on returning to the U.S. as a result of her deportation.

An email requesting comment was sent Wednesday to Alawieh's attorneys.

“This Court simply cannot issue in this habeas action the orders Alawieh hopes to obtain,” Sorokin wrote on Oct. 31.

Furthermore, Sorokin pointed to Congress and a U.S. Supreme Court decision from 2020 that upheld a fast-track deportation process and significantly limited federal district court judges from intervening.

“The five-year bar on her return is not a consequence of the detention she originally challenged as unlawful. It is a feature of the expedited removal order issued during that detention — an order which, ultimately, led to her release from detention into the cabin of a plane leaving the United States,” the judge wrote.

“I would say to the immigrant community, continue to stand strong.
We need thousands of voices.” For many immigrant residents, the resolution represents both relief and recognition.
We deserve to feel safe here.” Organizers said passage of the resolution is a victory not only for Bridgeport’s immigrant families but also for local advocacy groups.
“People showing up, raising their voices and holding their leaders accountable.” While the resolution does not change federal law or ICE enforcement practices directly, advocates say it establishes a clear local stance that could influence how ICE interacts with Bridgeport residents.","After months of organizing, rallies, and emotional testimony, Bridgeport’s City Council voted this week to approve a resolution strengthening protections for immigrant residents — a victory advocates say demonstrates the resilience of a community long forced to live in fear.

For many in the audience, the vote felt like a moment years in the making. Dozens of residents, organizers and families filled City Hall chambers, many wearing shirts and holding signs from Make the Road Connecticut (MRCT), a statewide immigrant rights organization that led months of advocacy around the measure. When the resolution passed, applause erupted, followed by hugs, tears, and chants in Spanish.

“This is a big win,” said Sonia Hernandez, an organizer with MRCT and an undocumented immigrant from Honduras who has lived in Bridgeport for more than a decade. “We cannot wait for ICE to attack us and separate more families. Our kids should focus on their studies, not be afraid that they might not find their parents when they return from school.”

Introduced by Councilman Jorge Cruz Jr., with co-sponsors Denese Taylor-Moye and Alfredo Castillo, the resolution affirms Bridgeport’s commitment to protecting immigrant families and calls for greater transparency in how federal immigration enforcement operates in the city.

The measure urges federal agencies to limit enforcement actions to serious public safety threats and to end ICE raids in public spaces such as schools, churches and community areas. It also calls for public reporting on ICE requests and prohibits local officials from participating in civil immigration enforcement.

Hernandez said the resolution sends a clear message to the city’s immigrant population.

“Our community is in fear, and kids are being traumatized. People are becoming emotionally depressed. If you say Bridgeport is a welcoming city, you’re welcoming everybody, but you’re not protecting them,” she said. “We want transparency from immigration officers. Show their badges, show their warrants signed by a judge.”

She added that the passage of the resolution could inspire other Connecticut cities like Stamford and Danbury to take similar action.

Councilman Cruz said he was motivated to act after witnessing ICE operations across the country and wanted to ensure Bridgeport would not be a place where families were torn apart.

“I didn’t want to feel helpless watching ICE agents going around targeting Black and brown people,” Cruz said. “I would say to the immigrant community, continue to stand strong. Have your eyes and ears open, but don’t live in fear. Stay connected to organizations and resources that are right here in Bridgeport.”

Cruz emphasized the importance of community support. “We love you. We want you here. We respect the law. What we don’t respect is terrorizing,” he said. He also acknowledged that one voice alone isn’t enough to create lasting change. “I’m just one voice. We need thousands of voices.”

For many immigrant residents, the resolution represents both relief and recognition. Bridgeport has one of the largest Spanish-speaking populations in Connecticut, and advocates say many undocumented residents live with daily fear — afraid to drive to work, walk their kids to school or even shop for groceries.

Daira Marin, a youth organizer and coordinator for MRCT, said the measure addresses basic dignity and everyday fear.

“They shouldn’t be scared to go out and buy bread for their family, go to school, or even just get on the bus to go to work,” Marin said. “Change starts at a local level. Small changes are really what drive everything forward.”

Nelly Mendoza, a Bridgeport resident and member of Make the Road Connecticut, expressed relief and hope.

“I’m so happy because we have a lot of families scared outside,” she said. “Now, I feel like we can breathe a little. This shows that when we speak up, we can make change.”

Hernandez highlighted the community effort behind the victory. “When we show up, they have to listen,” she said. “We’re not invisible. We are part of this city. We work here. We raise our families here. We deserve to feel safe here.”

Organizers said passage of the resolution is a victory not only for Bridgeport’s immigrant families but also for local advocacy groups. Make the Road Connecticut and other organizations spent months mobilizing residents to attend council meetings, make phone calls and participate in rallies.

“This is what democracy looks like,” said Marin. “People showing up, raising their voices and holding their leaders accountable.”

While the resolution does not change federal law or ICE enforcement practices directly, advocates say it establishes a clear local stance that could influence how ICE interacts with Bridgeport residents. It also provides a framework for ongoing community oversight and accountability.

“This is not just about a resolution,” Hernandez said. “It’s about dignity, respect and being seen as human. For the Spanish-speaking community in Bridgeport, this is a message that they are not alone. It tells them that their lives matter, that their children deserve to grow up without fear.”

Even with the resolution’s passage, organizers say their work is not done. MRCT plans to continue monitoring the city’s implementation and push for broader protections at the state and national levels.

“Change starts locally,” Marin said. “We can’t fix everything overnight, but this is where it begins.”

Outside City Hall, chants of “Sí, se puede!” — yes, we can — echoed through the plaza.

For Hernandez, the victory was deeply personal. “This shows what organizing can do,” she said. “Our voices mattered. And that means everything.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8988.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:17:20.013112

What Can the ...,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-said-mamdani-win-could-trigger-national-guard-deployment-what-can-mayor-elect-do,"If President Donald Trump makes good on his threats, Zohran Mamdani may become the first New York City mayor forced to navigate an uninvited federal deployment of the National Guard.
Similar state-led litigation would be the most effective way of combating a National Guard deployment in New York, legal experts say.
Presidentially deployed troops are prohibited from participating in civilian law enforcement activities, such as making arrests or executing warrants.
That could scramble the city’s playbook for responding to major demonstrations at a time when the Trump administration has cited protests to justify deploying the National Guard.
But she pointed out that strong local opposition didn’t stop Trump from trying to send the National Guard to other cities.","If President Donald Trump makes good on his threats, Zohran Mamdani may become the first New York City mayor forced to navigate an uninvited federal deployment of the National Guard. Last month, Trump insinuated that he’d send troops to “clean up” the country’s biggest city if Mamdani won the election, as he did decisively Tuesday night. Trump administration officials have also threatened to ramp up immigration enforcement raids in the city.

On the campaign trail, Mamdani, whose campaign did not respond to questions for this article, argued that he was the candidate who would staunchly defend the five boroughs from federal law enforcement. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, he welcomed a confrontation with the president.

“Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,” he said. “New York will remain a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants. And as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.”

The rhetoric matched his vow during the last mayoral debate to fight Trump “every step of the way” on immigration raids by federal law enforcement. Mamdani has also praised litigation that has limited the deployment of National Guard troops in other cities and touted a “coalition” between himself, Governor Kathy Hochul, and Attorney General Letitia James “that would be on the front lines of fighting Donald Trump.”

There are relatively few precedents in United States history for Trump’s deployments of the National Guard to cities that have seen protests against his immigration policies. Critics are concerned that sending military troops — trained to fight overseas — to respond to domestic opponents of the president could suppress dissent and stoke fear among immigrant communities.

The mayor’s formal power to constrain federal troops and agents is limited: Experts and officials say that state-level action above City Hall and grassroots organizing below it offer the most promising avenues to stymie federal incursions. Yet as the city’s top official, Mamdani could bolster those efforts.

Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., where they’ve policed the streets, and Los Angeles, where their mission is to protect federal property and agents. He’s tried to deploy them in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, but lawsuits from state officials have scuttled those efforts so far.

Similar state-led litigation would be the most effective way of combating a National Guard deployment in New York, legal experts say.

“As a general proposition, the mayor is not the most empowered official of state or local government to push back on a National Guard deployment,” said Chris Mirasola, an assistant professor at the University of Houston Law Center and expert on domestic military deployment.

City governments can also help build the state’s legal arguments. The White House can call the National Guard into federal service when the country faces foreign invasion or a rebellion, or if the president can’t execute federal laws without them. Presidentially deployed troops are prohibited from participating in civilian law enforcement activities, such as making arrests or executing warrants.

Given those restrictions, documented facts from the ground are important to convince courts that federal claims of rebellion or rampant crime are overblown, and that troops have taken on law enforcement roles they can’t legally carry out, said Perry Grossman, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Some local officials and activists are already planning an information-gathering effort. Hands Off NYC, a coalition of unions, faith groups, and advocacy organizations, held a call last week to discuss how residents could take action to counter federal troops, including by documenting federal activity in their communities to support legal action. The mayor could use his public platform to raise awareness of those efforts, perhaps encouraging New Yorkers to use a web portal the state attorney general’s office announced last month, after a high-profile raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown, to submit videos and photos of federal activity.

That could be “a really effective mechanism for getting that information” into the hands of state attorneys to support litigation, Mirasola said.

When it comes to countering federal law enforcement conducting immigration raids, Mamdani could play a critical role in funneling resources to immigration legal services, and making sure the city’s Law Department is ready to file lawsuits, said Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition.

He could also look to the leaders of other cities for inspiration. In Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass confronted federal agents at a park in a heavily immigrant neighborhood — part of a show of opposition that some observers credit with turning around her political fortunes. In Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring federal agents from city property for civil immigration enforcement, though some advocates want the city to do more to enforce that order.

In Chicago, as in New York, local police officers are barred from collaborating with civil immigration enforcement, but they’ve found themselves in the middle of clashes between immigration authorities and residents — and sometimes teargassed by federal agents.

The New York City Police Department could find itself similarly torn between staying out of ICE raids and maintaining order, said Scott Shuchart, who served as assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy at ICE under the Biden administration. Some degree of communication about federal activities would be helpful even as the agency does not collaborate with civil immigration enforcement, he said.

“You don’t want a shooting war between the NYPD and ICE, but you obviously need the police to actually provide public safety when you have this private army driving around the city doing whatever,” Shuchart said.

Some elected officials have said they want to see the department take a more oppositional stance, arresting federal agents if they break the law. Mamdani said last month that ICE officers should be “held to account” in those cases.

“What we have seen from ICE is that they are a reckless entity, one that cares little for the rule of law in the US, for the people who they are supposed to serve,” he said.

Calls to arrest ICE agents amounts to “grandstanding,” argued former NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton.

“That would not happen if those federal law enforcement officials are engaged in actions that are sanctioned by the attorney general, sanctioned by the federal government,” he said.

New York police officers weren’t on the scene in Chinatown when federal authorities arrested nine immigrants last month, but members of the department’s controversial Strategic Response Group were stationed at 26 Federal Plaza as protesters gathered that evening. That’s the right role for the agency, Bratton argued.

Mamdani has vowed to disband the Strategic Response Group, which has drawn complaints and lawsuits over its treatment of protesters. That could scramble the city’s playbook for responding to major demonstrations at a time when the Trump administration has cited protests to justify deploying the National Guard.

Whatever role Mamdani plays, immigrants’ rights advocates and local leaders aren’t waiting for his inauguration to begin preparing for the possibility of expanded ICE raids or the deployment of the National Guard.

City Councilmember Jennifer Gutierréz, of Brooklyn, said in an interview before the election that she’s eager to see the next mayor take a strong stance against federal forces in New York City. But she pointed out that strong local opposition didn’t stop Trump from trying to send the National Guard to other cities. Litigation and other formal measures alone have limited value to counter an administration that has shown a willingness to push the bounds of the law, she argued.

At the neighborhood level, Gutierréz has been working with nonprofits and schools to disseminate information about legal rights and organize support networks that could distribute food and accompany kids to class if a federal law enforcement influx leaves immigrant residents afraid to leave their homes. The mayor could amplify those efforts, too, she said.

“I think there is 100% value in that,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47661/s7OH5YRMluZ2IJ3GLfv3FC-TA-aS2Qp9F7RrWxziVyk/w%3A820/h%3A546/rt%3Afill/g%3Afp%3A0.5%3A0.5/q%3A90/el%3A1/ahr0chm6ly9zmy51cy1lyxn0ltiuyw1hem9uyxdzlmnvbs9uexnmb2n1cy9nyxlvcmfslu5hdglvbmfslud1yxjklvjlc2lzd_0.png?h=4bc2b340&itok=B5gR5uN_,N,,2025-11-05 16:02:31.250664

Carballo says immigration policies in Mexico “criminalize migrants” delaying the process.
Carballo says this perception needs to change as many migrants actually want to live and prosper in Mexico.
According to Carballo, U.S. policies, which force Mexico to take in deported migrants, makes it difficult to process and determine who really wants asylum in Mexico.
The United Nations Refugee Agency says 78,906 asylum applications by refugees and migrants were received in Mexico last year.","SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — Applications for political asylum in Mexico are taking up to two years for a resolution, according to Darinka Carballo, director of the Gaia Migrant Foundation in Baja California.

Carballo says immigration policies in Mexico “criminalize migrants” delaying the process.

“Their motives aren’t considered to be true,” Carballo said. “The process is delayed due to the institutional biases in place.”

She is asking the National Human Rights Commission, public defenders’ groups in Mexico, and that country’s Institute of Migration to speed up the process.

“We’re not asking for charity, we’re not asking for favors, we’re simply asking that we follow closely with federal statutes and our own constitution.”

For decades, Mexico has been seen as a country for migrants in transit. Carballo says this perception needs to change as many migrants actually want to live and prosper in Mexico.

She said the most prevalent demographic group of migrants includes people from Haiti, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Carballo said another reason for the slow asylum process is that many migrants haven’t secured proper documentation to legally migrate to Mexico, making it harder to identify them and figure out what their human and legal rights are.

“When families and foreigners arrive in Mexico, many don’t have their documents, this makes them more vulnerable to red tape and delays,” she said.

According to Carballo, U.S. policies, which force Mexico to take in deported migrants, makes it difficult to process and determine who really wants asylum in Mexico.

The United Nations Refugee Agency says 78,906 asylum applications by refugees and migrants were received in Mexico last year. Figures for 2025 have not been released.

Depending on a variety of factors, such as a person’s country of origin, this kind of sex testing can cost a small fortune.
And we know from decades of sports scandals that sex testing is also weaponized against cisgender women, and disproportionately, women of color.
Think: Imane Khelif, Caster Semenya, or one of the eight women who suddenly found out they were intersex during sex testing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, likely ending their athletics careers.
Even before the DHS added the new sex testing provision, countless medical groups, politicians, legal scholars, and human rights organizations decried Trump’s biometric powergrab.","A proposed change to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule could impose “biological sex” DNA testing on millions of immigrants and Americans as part of the Department’s mass biometric surveillance program—which also includes retinal scans, voice capture, and more.

In addition to the obvious human rights violations posed by the changes—which, among other things, would amend policy to allow children to be targeted by biometric surveillance—it would put a target on the back of trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people, as well as women and trans people of color, citizens and non-citizens alike.

“Under this proposed rule, DHS may also require, request, or accept raw DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or DNA test results, which include a partial DNA profile, as evidence of genetic relationship, to determine eligibility for immigration and naturalization benefits or to perform any other functions necessary for administering and enforcing immigration and naturalization laws,” the proposal reads. “Where evidence of a relationship is required, this rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results (which include a partial DNA profile) from relevant parties such as applicants, petitioners, derivatives, dependents, and beneficiaries, to prove or disprove the existence of a claimed, or unclaimed, genetic relationship or biological sex.”

For example, it says, “DHS may request DNA evidence to prove or disprove an individual’s biological sex in instances where that determination will impact benefit eligibility.”

The policy as proposed doesn’t have many safeguards for privacy or constitutionality—the government can retain someone’s DNA profile indefinitely. It could further be weaponized to deny bids for immigration or asylum, out trans and intersex women being held in detention (who may not even know they are intersex otherwise), and track individuals in perpetuity through “continuous vetting.”

The DHS claims these changes will enable immigration officials to perform more thorough background checks, prevent fraud, and enforce immigration and naturalization laws. But it’s not only new arrivals that could be forcibly subjected to this treatment—longtime residents, naturalized citizens, and the families and sponsors of immigrants may also have to submit to sex tests.

Alejandra Caraballo, an instructor at Harvard’s cyber law program who has also provided legal aid to trans immigrants, called the initiative “dystopian.” When paired with troubling innovations in surveillance tech and attempts to criminalize trans people’s very existence, she says, the devastating potential of this rule, if finalized, cannot be overstated.

“You can create a digital Panopticon,” Caraballo said.

There is a 60-day public comment period ahead of any formal implementation.

The policy in question falls under the guidelines for the Collection and Use of Biometrics by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It’s a revitalized version of a 2020 proposal from Donald Trump’s first term empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to launch dragnet surveillance campaigns.

That original bid was struck down by the Biden Administration before it could take effect, but Trump 2.0 brought it back with added provisions greenlighting sex testing via buccal swab—in other words, testing the chromosomal composition of DNA in a person’s saliva.

These biometrics can be used to trace and quash dissent, surveil marginalized communities, and add massive obstacles to trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people entering the country, including asylum seekers who may be fleeing gender-based violence abroad. If you can’t prove you’re a “biological woman” to the White House’s liking, then your ability to file for relief under, say, the Violence Against Women Act, may become more difficult.

Depending on a variety of factors, such as a person’s country of origin, this kind of sex testing can cost a small fortune. Not to mention the implications of such a policy ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles—if the U.S. government can grant or deny visa requests based on its own unscientific and inexact definitions of “biological sex,” then it can functionally control who gets to compete. And we know from decades of sports scandals that sex testing is also weaponized against cisgender women, and disproportionately, women of color. Think: Imane Khelif, Caster Semenya, or one of the eight women who suddenly found out they were intersex during sex testing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, likely ending their athletics careers.

Even before the DHS added the new sex testing provision, countless medical groups, politicians, legal scholars, and human rights organizations decried Trump’s biometric powergrab. During the public comment process for the 2020 version of the policy, the American Medical Association argued that authorities lack “the capability to collect and process DNA at the appropriate scientific level to ensure evidence-based standards,” and that it further robs women and children fleeing violence of “informed, non-coercive consent.”

Meanwhile, The National Center for Lesbian Rights chimed in that the rule tramples privacy rights and “empowers mass and unprecedented surveillance” of the LGBTQ community. And the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security said the rule would increase the already staggering backlog of immigrant applicants under the DHS while endangering the personal data of millions.

“Like any authoritarian regime, they want control over the population, and they feel like they need control over the identification of every single person, in a multitude of ways, so that they can be tracked,” Caraballo told Erin in the Morning. “There’s no more anonymity.”",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1637929476734-bd7f5f78e40a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxkbmF8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzYyMzcxNzcxfDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080,N,,2025-11-05 16:17:32.505914

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The war in Sudan is “spiraling out of control,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said yesterday, adding it is essential that “no more weapons come into Sudan.” Nearly 71,000 people have been displaced since the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary (RSF) took hold of El Fasher, according to the International Organization for Migration. Jon Gambrell reports for AP News.

A drone attack on a funeral gathering in the North Kordofan State, Sudan, killed at least 40 civilians on Monday, according to local reports and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Sudanese media reports allege that the strikes were carried out by the RSF. Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times.

Executive Director of Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab Nathaniel Raymond yesterday told Al Jazeera that the RSF “have begun to dig mass graves and collect bodies throughout [El Fasher].” A senior official at UNHCR in Sudan said yesterday, “The current insecurity continues to block access, preventing the delivery of life-saving assistance to those trapped in the city without food, water and medical care.” Al Jazeera reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Hamas yesterday returned the body of deceased U.S.-Israeli hostage Itay Chen to Israel. Israel returned the bodies of 15 more Palestinians to Gaza today. Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Wafaa Shurafa reports for AP News.

Aid agencies are in “a race against time” to get food and other supplies into Gaza, a U.N. World Food Programme spokesperson said yesterday, adding “we need everything to be moving fast… the winter months are coming.” WFP said that they are severely limited in their operations because only two crossings into Gaza are currently open. The Norwegian Refugee Council said that Israeli authorities have rejected 23 requests from nine aid agencies to bring in essential shelter material since the ceasefire took effect on October 10. Al Jazeera reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

The Russian Defence Ministry said today that its forces were advancing north inside the city of Pokrovsk and clearing out Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military said that fierce fighting was underway in Pokrovsk, special forces had arrived, and more weapons were being sent. Both Russia and Ukraine continue to issue claims and counterclaims about the situation. Guy Faulconbridge and Andrew Osborn report for Reuters; Laura Gozzi reports for BBC News.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. military killed two people yesterday in another strike on an alleged drug vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced. It was the 16th strike announced by the Defense Department since operations began in early September. Carol Rosenberg reports for the New York Times.

The Trump administration has prepared several possible plans for military action in Venezuela, including direct attacks on military units that protect Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and moves to seize control of Venezuelan oil fields, according to several U.S. officials. Officials said that Trump had yet to decide on how to proceed, adding that he is reluctant to place U.S. troops at risk. Some officials expect that upcoming guidance from the Justice Department on the legal basis for further military action will argue that Maduro and his security officials are central figures in the Cartel de los Soles, a U.S.-designated narco-terrorist group. David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, Helene Cooper, Eric Schmitt, and Devlin Barrett report for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney yesterday released details of a C$64 billion defense budget. The plan would include another C$81 billion for the Canadian military over the next five years. Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

Iran must “seriously improve” co-operation with U.N. inspectors to avoid increasing tensions with the West, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi told the Financial Times. Gross said that the IAEA had carried out around 12 inspections in Iran since June, but it had not been given access to the most important nuclear facilities.

Bosnia’s Constitutional Court said yesterday that it had rejected appeals by former president of Bosnia’s autonomous Serb Republic, Milorad Dodik, against a verdict barring him from politics and against a decision to strip him of his mandate as a regional president. The court said that both appeals were without foundation. Dario Sito-Sucic reports for Reuters.

China and Russia announced yesterday in a joint statement that “both sides will make every necessary effort to carry out mutual assistance and cooperation in opposing unilateral coercive measures.” In the statement, Beijing and Moscow stressed the need to “prevent some country from abusing their monopoly and dominant position in specific sectors of the world economy,” without naming the United States directly. Liz Lee, Ethan Wang, Xiuhao Chen, and Lidia Kelly report for Reuters.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Prosecutors alleged in an indictment filed last month that three American cybersecurity professionals secretly ran a ransomware operation aimed at taking down U.S.-based companies. The three people are said to have collaborated with ALPHV BlackCAT, a notorious hacking gang, to encrypt companies’ networks and extort their owners out of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency. Raphael Satter reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Treasury Department yesterday sanctioned nearly a dozen North Korean individuals and tech groups for their alleged roles in a scheme to steal funds from U.S. companies by posing as remote tech employees. Maggie Miller reports for POLITICO.

The Pentagon is considering a request from Saudi Arabia to buy 48 F-35 fighter jets, according to two sources. The Pentagon’s policy department has worked on the potential transactions for months, and the case has now progressed to secretary level within the Defense Department, according to one official. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

The United States has proposed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would lift sanctions on Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa, according to the draft resolution seen by Reuters yesterday. Michelle Nichols reports.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT THE REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump said yesterday on social media. The Democrats won the Virginia and New Jersey governor elections, and Democratic candidate Zohan Mamdani won the mayoral election. Trump did not elaborate on which pollsters he was quoting. Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Polling stations across seven counties in New Jersey received bomb-threat emails on election day yesterday, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. “Law enforcement has determined that there are no credible threats at this time,” Lieutenant Governor Tahesha Way said yesterday. Passaic County received three threats and redirected some affected voters to other locations. Julie Carr Smyth and Hannah Fingerhut report for AP News.

“I write to demand an explanation for why [the Justice Department] has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, requesting information as to why the DOJ “fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation.” DOJ has not responded to CBS News’ request for comment at the time of writing. Kaia Hubbard and Graham Kates report.

Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan (R-OH) yesterday wrote to Verizon and AT&T requesting materials relating to former special counsel Jack Smith’s seizure of phone records of Republican congressmen around the time of the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Jordan said the DOJ’s actions under Biden amounted to “spying on lawmakers and constituted an abuse of power.” Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Roger Wicker (R-MS) yesterday said that he has seen an “unsettling trend” in the Pentagon that undermines Trump’s commitment to NATO, singling out policy chief Elbridge Colby’s office in particular. “Members and staff of this committee have struggled to receive information from the policy office,” Wicker said, adding, “the situation needs to improve if we are to craft the best defence policy.” Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

“The administration is fully complying with the court order. I just spoke to the president about it,” the White House clarified yesterday. This clarification came after Trump posted on social media that money for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government.” Trump’s post also contradicted guidance on how to fund the November benefits published by the Department of Agriculture earlier on Tuesday. Gregory Svirnovskiy and Marcia Brown report for POLITICO.

White House aides have been strategizing on how to reconstitute Trump’s global tariff regime if the Supreme Court rules that he has exceeded his authority, according to six current and former White House officials. The White House is ready to make use of other trade statutes to keep pressure on U.S. trading partners and preserve billions in tariff revenue, the source said. Aides conceded that other tariff authorities are not a “one-for-one replacement” for relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, but confirmed they are pursuing them. Megan Messerly, Doug Palmer, Daniel Desrochers, and Ari Hawkins report for POLITICO.

Several Pentagon officials told Reuters that they are experiencing whiplash from Trump’s orders as they try to understand the defense priorities of this administration. Announcements from nuclear testing to possible military action in Nigeria have caught officials off guard. One U.S. military official said, “I think we are all learning about this at the same time,” with regard to Trump’s Nigeria announcement. Phil Stewart, Idees Ali, and Steve Holland report.

“Director [Kash] Patel has disregarded the law and launched a campaign of erratic and arbitrary retribution,” the FBI Agents Association said yesterday in a statement, adding “FBI agents deal in facts, and we urge Director Patel to do the same.” A spokesperson for the association told Axios that the FBI’s decision to fire, reinstate, and then once again fire agents yesterday “highlight[s] the chaos that occurs when long-standing policies and processes are ignored.” Josephine Walker reports; Perry Stein reports for the Washington Post.

Furlough notifications sent to Agriculture Department employees last week did not include any mention of back payment or the 2019 law requiring such payments, unlike earlier notifications sent out at the beginning of the government shutdown. This was also the case for employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and the National Park Service. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge yesterday ruled that the Department of Transportation cannot withhold billions of dollars in funding to states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement conditions. The judge said that the DOT and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy had blatantly overstepped their authority by linking funding for road maintenance and bridges to immigration demands.

That’s because, ever since crossing the border near Lukeville, Arizona, in September of 2023, he’s been in immigration detention.
Luis Campos, an immigration attorney in Tucson who recently took on Maklad’s case, says that used to be rare.
“The optics of this case are terrible, a gentleman won his case in an immigration court, the government refuses to release him,” Campos said.
“I’m wasting away.” As his U.S. court documents describe, an arrest warrant was eventually issued for him there for failing to enlist in the military during wartime.","Federal court data shows as of last count, in July, more than 2.3 million asylum applications are pending in the U.S. this year. It’s nearing a historic high from 2024, and attorneys say it comes as legal pathways to stay here get more narrow, and deportations increase.

But, even winning protection in the U.S. doesn’t always mean the end of the story.

That’s the case for Kamel Maklad. Even though he’s been in the U.S. for more than two years now, he hasn’t actually seen much. That’s because, ever since crossing the border near Lukeville, Arizona, in September of 2023, he’s been in immigration detention.

I reached him over a tinny phone line at the Eloy Detention Center — south of Phoenix — where he’s spent most of the last two years.

Maklad fled his home country of Syria more than a decade ago, when civil war was first breaking out there. Maklad is Druze. It’s a religious minority that’s been targeted by other groups in Syria over the years.

He says his Druze community collectively decided to stay out of the war when it began. So when young men were being forced to join Syria’s military, Maklad left for Venezuela, one of the few countries where he says getting a visa was an option as a Syrian back then. That’s how he learned to speak Spanish.

“I bought [my visa], set it up, and I left, just like thousands of my cousins, my relatives, my religious community,” he said in Spanish. “They decided to leave the country rather than hand it over to the army, rather than hand it over to that war,.""

But, he says, by 2023, his work and residency permits had expired. That August, he set out for the U.S. His group passed through seven countries and the rugged Darien Gap jungle to get here.

“Thank god, we made it to Panama,” he said. “From Panama, we went to Costa Rica, from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.”

Once in Mexico, Maklad says he registered for CBP One. He still has the confirmation number for his application to the the Biden-era smartphone app — which had migrants who were trying to seek asylum in the U.S. vie for a fixed number of appointments at a handful of border ports of entry.

But after almost a month, Maklad says he got robbed and received threats in Mexico. So, he headed for the border near Lukeville and presented himself to Border Patrol agents there instead.

Under the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule — another Biden-era border restriction in effect at the time — crossing the border in-between official entry points made Maklad ineligible for U.S. asylum, regardless of his case.

Border restrictions and asylum backlogs

Last year, a federal judge determined Maklad was more likely than not to be tortured if sent back to Syria and granted him what’s called withholding of removal and protection under the UN Convention Against Torture. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, with the Migration Policy Institute, says this lesser form of protection is harder in some ways to win than asylum, but it’s being considered more often over the last few years.

“You have to meet a higher standard of proof, and the burden to do that is on the non-citizen,” she said. “And one of the reasons that we’re seeing more of these now is not only because of the Trump administration’s restrictions on asylum, but also because of the Biden administration’s restrictions.”

Restrictions like the rule that prohibited Maklad from accessing full asylum back in 2023, Bush-Joseph says. Rights groups sued to stop the policy back then and it’s been stuck in litigation. Now, the Trump administration is defending it in court.

“You’re layering restriction on top of restriction,” Bush-Joseph said.

She says those restrictions contribute to the court backlog, too — as some attorneys advise clients to apply for asylum even if they might be found ineligible, because the restrictions are still being litigated and could be struck down.

That’s adding to the asylum caseload at a time when there are fewer immigration judges to adjudicate — just 600 remained on the bench nationwide as last month, according to figures by the judge’s union, after federal firings and buyouts. Federal data shows the number of asylum cases being denied this year is the highest it's been in at least a decade.

And, as Bush-Joseph notes, immigration enforcement will see a $170 billion boost through the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, but it won’t help the courts.

“There was actually a cap on the number of immigration judges that could be hired, even though analysts have predicted that it would take more than 1000 judges to be working through the backlog over the course of a decade,” she said.

Deportation agreements

Unlike asylum, those that receive protection through a withholding of removal order, like Maklad, can still be removed from the U.S. if a different country accepts them.

Luis Campos, an immigration attorney in Tucson who recently took on Maklad’s case, says that used to be rare. Instead, people were generally released from detention and given a work permit in the U.S. He says things have changed this year.

“None of these changes work in favor of respondents like Kamel,” Campos said.

The Trump administration is ramping up efforts to get countries to take deportees from other places. Almost a dozen have agreed to those removals so far, including Uganda, El Salvador and South Sudan.

Venezuela isn’t on that list. Nevertheless, Maklad was boarded onto a deportation flight headed there in September.

He says he’d agreed after ICE assured him he’d be accepted. But once he arrived, Venezuelan officials told him they had no knowledge of his deportation. And sent him back.

After a brief stint in Texas, he was detained at Eloy again, back where he started in 2023.

“I remember falling into a deep sadness,” he said. “I'd been fighting for my freedom for almost two years, doing everything legally.”

DHS did not respond to questions about the Venezuela flight. But in an email, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Maklad a “suspected terrorist” and a “serious threat to the public,” and said he would not be released into the U.S.

Maklad’s name doesn’t appear in any U.S. district court filing. DHS didn’t provide evidence to those claims or answer questions about why they hadn’t come up in Maklad’s previous court hearings or asylum interviews.

Campos says U.S. law would have prohibited Maklad from accessing the type of protection he got if claims of terrorism had been brought back then.

“The optics of this case are terrible, a gentleman won his case in an immigration court, the government refuses to release him,” Campos said. “They’ve tried an illegal rendition to a third country. So how do they fix this? Let’s call him a terrorist.”

‘I’m wasting away’

Campos and other attorneys are trying to file a habeas corpus petition for Maklad, which would force the case before a judge. But for now, he’s stuck in detention.

“I’m wearing myself out,” Maklad says. “I’m wasting away.”

As his U.S. court documents describe, an arrest warrant was eventually issued for him there for failing to enlist in the military during wartime. Another threat came in 2018, when ISIS fighters killed hundreds of people in his hometown of Swaida, including some of his family members.

His younger sister, Shorouq, is still there. She says she worries about Maklad's health in detention — he suffered a heart attack back in 2018 after the attack in his hometown and required surgery. But, she says, coming back isn't safe.

“I don't want Kamel to ever come back to Syria, not even to Swaida, because there's absolutely no safety there,” she said in a voice memo in Arabic on WhatsApp. “There's no internet, no electricity and no water, unless we buy it … the situation is very miserable here.”

Maklad knows Syria isn't safe. But he says he needs to help his family and he doesn’t mind starting over.

“When I arrived in Venezuela, I didn't speak a word of Spanish — I spent half an hour trying to order an empanada,” he said. “I worked hard to learn Spanish … and it doesn't bother me, but what I'm looking for is a country where I can find peace. That’s all I’m looking for.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3252dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F5a%2F341db4c647a997d71f755a841cd6%2F11042025-azr-kamel-maklad.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:02:35.809341

The tariffs case heard Wednesday is the first major challenge to Trump’s presidential power to be heard by the court.","The Supreme Court justices sounded skeptical Wednesday of President Trump’s claim that he has the power to set large tariffs on products coming from countries around the world.

Most of the justices, both conservative and liberal, said Congress, not the president, had the power to impose taxes and tariffs. And they agreed Congress did not authorize tariffs in an emergency powers law adopted in 1977.

It has “never before been used to justify tariffs, and no one had argued it before this case,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. told Trump’s top courtroom attorney. “The imposition of taxes on Americans ... has always been a core power of Congress.”

Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer argued that tariffs involve the president’s power over foreign affairs. They are “regulatory tariffs, not taxes,” he said.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan disagreed.

Imposing a tariff “is a taxing power which is delegated by the Constitution to Congress,” Kagan said.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said he too was skeptical of the claim the president had the power to impose taxes based on his belief that the nation faces a global emergency.

If so, could a future president acting on his own impose a 50% tax on cars because of climate change? he asked.

Gorsuch said the court has recently blocked far-reaching presidential regulations by Democratic presidents that went beyond an old and vague law, and the same may be called for here.

Otherwise, presidents may feel free to take away the taxing power “from the people’s representatives,” he said.

But Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Samuel A. Alito Jr. questioned the challenge to the president’s tariffs.

Kavanaugh pointed to a round of tariffs imposed by President Nixon in 1971, and he said Congress later adopted its emergency powers act without clearly rejecting that authority.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett said she was struggling to understand what Congress meant in the emergency powers law when it said the president may “regulate” importation.

She agreed the law did not mention taxes and tariffs that would raise revenue, but some judges then saw it as allowing the authority to impose duties or tariffs.

The tariffs case heard Wednesday is the first major challenge to Trump’s presidential power to be heard by the court. It is also a test of whether the court’s conservative majority is willing to set legal limits on Trump’s executive authority.

Trump has touted these import taxes as crucial to reviving American manufacturing.

But owners of small businesses, farmers and economists are among the critics who say the on-again, off-again import taxes are disrupting business and damaging the economy.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January, the court’s six Republican appointees have voted repeatedly to set aside orders from judges who had temporarily blocked the president’s policies and initiatives.

While they have not explained most of their temporary emergency rulings, the conservatives have said the president has broad executive authority over federal agencies and on matters of foreign affairs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d4ab7e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x2948+0+398/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Ff9%2F74fe1881475caf4031b5324493bb%2F2244643712.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 15:17:23.246202

Kennedy Human Rights today announced the release of 18-year-old Carlos Guerra Leon after his unlawful, months-long detention in a Louisiana ICE facility. Guerra Leon was released on October 31 after a federal judge from the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on October 30 calling for his immediate release. Defying the order, ICE officials refused to release Guerra Leon when his attorneys arrived at the detention facility that same day - forcing his legal team to file an emergency motion.

Within minutes of receiving the TRO, Guerra Leon’s attorneys drove more than five hours to Jackson Correctional Facility in northern Louisiana to bring Guerra Leon home. When they arrived, facility staff refused to release him despite being shown the federal order. ICE officials claimed to have “no knowledge” of the ruling and took no action to comply. Instead, the facility called the local sheriff on the attorneys.

""Carlos is an 18-year-old who wanted to go home to his mom,"" said Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project. ""There was no basis for him to be detained in the first place. Even with a team of attorneys and a federal court order requiring his immediate release, Carlos was forced to spend another night in jail. This is just another example of how immigration enforcement that targets everyone without regard to legal limits and failure to immediately act on court orders is harming our community members in irreparable ways.""

Ordering the government to respect Guerra Leon’s valid immigration protections - deferred action status and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) - Judge Terry Doughty wrote that Guerra Leon’s release, “...serves the public interest by ensuring that the Government adheres to its own laws and by preventing the public interest from being undermined through unnecessary detention.”

“The fact that Carlos sat unlawfully locked up for yet another night–beyond the already nearly three months of unlawful detention–packed into a room with over 100 grown men is abhorrent,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director for the ACLU of Louisiana.“One would have hoped that an administration so focused on law and order would uphold that very same law and order when it came knocking. That it was not upheld, calls into question the administration’s respect for the very foundation of our democracy and our three co-equal branches of government.”

“As a young person with special humanitarian protections, Carlos should’ve never been detained in the first place,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at RFK Human Rights. “But like so many others, he was snatched from his community and disappeared to Louisiana - a move we’ve seen time and time again as the government continues to weaponize immigration detention. We applaud the court for upholding Carlos’ fundamental rights and we applaud Carlos, who demonstrated amazing resilience and heart in an unimaginable situation. We remain committed to fighting for the many others like him who have been wrongfully subjected to this administration's cruelty.”

Guerra Leon is a recent high school graduate from Spring Valley, New York. He came to the United States from Guatemala when he was ten and was later granted deferred action status and SIJS, a humanitarian immigration program designed to protect children who have survived parental abuse, abandonment, and neglect. His status allowed him to attend school, work legally, and build a stable life in the U.S. But on August 9, Guerra Leon was stopped by federal officers and arrested without a warrant. He was sent to Jackson Parish Correctional Center, a Louisiana ICE facility a thousand miles from his home.

Guerra Leon has now been released and reunited with his family in New York.

“Due to the recent increase in ICE enforcement actions across the country, criminal actors are using ICE’s enhanced public profile and media coverage to their advantage to target vulnerable communities and commit criminal activity. This not only effects the victims and communities but also has broader negative consequences on law enforcement agencies,” the FBI wrote in a bulletin.

“These criminal impersonations make it difficult for the community to distinguish between legitimate officers conducting lawful law enforcement action and imposters engaging in criminal activity, which damages trust between the local community and law enforcement officers.”

The Oct. 17 bulletin, obtained by the group Property of the People through a public records request, comes as ICE has conducted widespread raids, often with partner agencies, and in some cases masked officers have refused to identify themselves or their agency.

In August in New York, three men robbed a restaurant and tied up its staff, with the victims initially surrendering to the robbers because they identified themselves as ICE officers.

In April in Florida, a man kidnapped a woman who agreed to leave with someone posing as an ICE officer, only to be taken to an apartment complex where she escaped.

In Brooklyn in February, a man posing as an ICE officer directed a woman to a stairwell where he punched her and then tried to rape her, ultimately fleeing the scene with her purse and cell phone.

And in January in North Carolina, a man posing as an ICE officer entered a woman’s hotel room and sexually assaulted her, saying he would deport her if she did not have sex with him.

The bulletin said law enforcement officers of all stripes need to “adequality identify themselves during operations and cooperate with individuals who request further verification, such as calling their local precinct to verify the officer’s identity.”

Neither the FBI nor ICE responded to a request for comment.

Critics have said the anonymity provided by masks and a lack of insignia not only creates opportunities for dangerous impersonations, but also shields actual officers with poor conduct.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, introduced a bill earlier this year that would bar masks and force officers to display insignia to identify themselves.

“If you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous. DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes — and deviates from the practices of local law enforcement, which contributes to confusion in communities,” Espaillat said when the bill was introduced in June.

“Many immigrants come to America seeking opportunities, hope, and freedom to escape draconian practices, and under no circumstance should they, or anyone, fear being disappeared by masked and armed individuals in unmarked vehicles. If you are upholding the law, you should not be anonymous.”

Border czar Tom Homan has expressed mixed feelings on ICE officers wearing masks, and Trump administration officials have complained officers are being doxxed.

“These men and women put a gun on their hip and wear a Kevlar vest to go on the streets every day looking for the worst of the worst to make this country safer. Wearing a mask, if that protects them and protects your families, then that has to be done,” Homan said.

On Wednesday, the justices pressed US Solicitor General D John Sauer, arguing for the administration, about whether Trump had intruded on the power of Congress in imposing tariffs under a 1977 law meant for national emergencies. They also asked Sauer whether Trump’s application of the statute to impose tariffs of unlimited duration was a major action by the executive branch that would require clear congressional authorisation.

The arguments come in appeals pursued by the administration after lower courts ruled that his unprecedented use of a 1977 federal law at issue to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. Businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led, challenged the tariffs.

Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. The tariffs – taxes on imported goods – could add up to trillions of dollars for the US over the next decade.

Sauer kicked off the arguments by defending the legal rationale employed by the president, but immediately faced questions raising scepticism about the administration’s arguments about the language and purpose of the statute at issue.

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency.

Imposing taxes ‘core power of Congress’

Sauer said Trump determined that US trade deficits have brought the nation to the brink of an economic and national security catastrophe. Sauer said imposition of the tariffs has helped Trump negotiate trade deals, and unwinding those agreements “would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences”.

The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. The administration has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to “regulate” imports to address emergencies.

The imposition of taxes on Americans “has always been the core power of Congress”, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts told Sauer, adding that these tariffs seem to be raising revenue, which the Constitution considers a role for Congress.

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Sauer about his argument that IEEPA’s language granting presidents emergency power to “regulate importation” encompasses tariffs.

“Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together ‘regulate importation’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?” Barrett asked.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the lead-up to the arguments that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s use of IEEPA, his tariffs are expected to remain in place because the administration would switch to other legal authorities to underpin them. Trump has imposed some additional tariffs, invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case.

Major questions doctrine

Sauer said the president’s actions in imposing the tariffs did not violate the Supreme Court’s “major questions” doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by Congress. The Supreme Court applied this doctrine to strike down key policies of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.

A lower court, in ruling against Trump, found that the tariffs were impermissible under this doctrine.

Some of the justices, in questioning Sauer on whether Trump’s tariffs would survive scrutiny under the “major questions doctrine”, noted that Congress did not include the word tariffs in IEEPA.

Roberts challenged Sauer to explain why the court’s major questions doctrine would not apply to Trump’s tariffs under IEEPA.

“The justification is being used for a power to impose tariffs on any product, from any country, in any amount, for any length of time. I’m not suggesting it’s not there, but it does seem like that’s major authority, and the basis for that claim seems to be a misfit. So why doesn’t it apply?” Roberts asked.

Sauer said the doctrine does not apply in the foreign affairs context, but Roberts then raised doubts that the president’s power in this domain could override inherent powers of Congress.

“The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been the core power of Congress,” Roberts told Sauer.

Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments.

Liberal Justice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer about his claim that Trump’s tariffs are supported by the president’s inherent powers under the Constitution. Kagan said the power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce is usually thought of as “quintessential” powers belonging to Congress, not the president.

Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said IEEPA was intended to limit presidential authority, not expand it.

“It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president,” Jackson said.

Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Sauer about a 10 percent tariff imposed on some imports in the early 1970s by then-President Richard Nixon under a predecessor statute to IEEPA.

Kavanaugh asked, “What’s the significance of the Nixon example and precedent here? Because I think figuring that out is really important to deciding this case correctly.”

‘Simply implausible’

Neal Katyal, a lawyer arguing for businesses that challenged the tariffs, told the justices that common sense makes clear that the administration’s interpretation of IEEPA is flawed.

“It is simply implausible that in enacting IEEPA, Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process,” Katyal said.

Questions posed by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that he thinks Sauer’s claims about the breadth of the president’s inherent foreign affairs powers would threaten to undermine the Constitution’s separation of powers between the federal government’s executive and legislative branches.

“What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce – or for that matter, declare war – to the president?” Gorsuch asked.

Gorsuch said that, as a practical matter, Congress cannot get authority over tariffs back if IEEPA is interpreted as handing that power over to the president. This interpretation would be a “one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives,” Gorsuch said.

The IEEPA-based tariffs have generated $89bn in estimated collections between February 4 and September 23, when the most recent data was released by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.

The Supreme Court has backed Trump in a series of decisions issued this year on an emergency basis. They have let Trump policies, which were impeded by lower courts amid questions about their legality, to proceed on an interim basis, prompting critics to warn that the justices are refusing to act as a check on the president’s power.

Global trade war

Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty.

He invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as, in February, as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the US.

Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariff advertisement by Canada’s Ontario province.

IEEPA gives the president power to deal with “an unusual and extraordinary threat” amid a national emergency. It had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. In passing IEEPA, Congress placed additional limits on the president’s authority compared to a predecessor law.

The study contends that Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) networks have become increasingly common in Washington and immigration enforcement has access to subsequent data in many cases.
There has been a proliferation of Flock ALPRs locally and nationally generating concerns related to privacy and the possibility of the systems’ use by immigration enforcement.

In a few cases, local law enforcement agencies conducted searches of ALPR data on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","The UW Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) released a report “Leaving the Door Wide Open: Flock Surveillance Systems Expose Washington Data to Immigration Enforcement” on Oct. 21. The study contends that Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) networks have become increasingly common in Washington and immigration enforcement has access to subsequent data in many cases.

Flock Safety is an American manufacturer and operator of security hardware and software, particularly ALPR, video surveillance, and gunfire locator systems.

“Flock reportedly has more ALPRs in service across the country than any of its competitors,” the report read. “The company boasts more than 80,000 AI-powered cameras across 49 U.S. states.”

Each jurisdiction that employs Flock technology creates its own “network.” Flock ALPRs capture images of cars in a given network that are read by AI and stored in Flock’s centralized database.

“The traditional license plate readers would take images of passing cars or stop signs or whatever, and then [it] get spits it out into a database that says, this license plate or this word was seen at this time of day in this place,” Phil Neff, research coordinator for the UWCHR, said. “Flock goes step further in that all the image imagery is, according to their marketing materials, analyzed by AI.”

The implications of this are that a search can be conducted for something as specific as a red Subaru with a broken tail light or the words on a bumper sticker, according to Neff. He added that this additional AI processing of data is a “big selling point” in their technology.

“The reason why we are so concerned about the use of these technologies by federal immigration enforcement agencies is because of the intensity of rights violations that we're seeing in the context of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign,” Neff said.

There has been a proliferation of Flock ALPRs locally and nationally generating concerns related to privacy and the possibility of the systems’ use by immigration enforcement. UWCHR researchers’ findings in Washington state in 2025 support these concerns.

At least eight WA state law enforcement agencies allowed for direct sharing of their networks with U.S. Border Patrol. Border Patrol also had apparent “back door” access to licence plate data captured by ALPRs, with plates run by at least 10 local law enforcement agencies that had not explicitly authorized sharing.

In a few cases, local law enforcement agencies conducted searches of ALPR data on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“There are multiple ways for Flock organizational customers to share their data; here, we refer to them as “front door” (direct sharing of data through a 1:1 relationship with another network); “back door” (access to networks without explicit authorization by the network owner); and “side door” (searches by authorized network users on behalf of other agencies without access to the network, potentially including federal immigration enforcement agencies),” the report read.

Additionally, Neff noted that it was “striking” to him how a number of agencies, when researchers requested flock audits, claimed that they had not reviewed these audits meaning they are not public records.

“So we can't look at them, which means that also, you know, residents, taxpayers in those jurisdictions, don't have the right to know who's searching the networks of the cameras that their taxes paid for and that are tracking their movements,” Neff said.

Currently, this technology is entirely unregulated in Washington state. Neff emphasized that regulations could look like tighter limits on data retention or stronger regulations around audits and auditing.

Neff refused the notion that it is “inevitable” that these technologies are constantly expanding into different areas of tracking. He nodded to the multiple states that have rejected the use of Flock technology.

“There are places that have turned them off or literally put hoods over them,” Neff said. “So you know, it's not a given that we have to subject ourselves to 24/7 surveillance of this nature.”

The statement highlights that the Convention has helped protect rights across Europe, and that, given widespread political and environmental instability, the pace of technological change, and rising polarisation around the globe, the Convention is needed now more than ever,

The statement points out that, in the UK, the ECHR has helped protect rights across the country, ‘from victims of sexual violence to LGBT+ service personnel, public interest journalists to mental health patients and victims of serious injustice (from Hillsborough to Windrush)’. It also highlights the role the ECHR played in bringing peace in Northern Ireland.

‘We reject the narrative that human rights are not in the interests of the public – everyone in our society would be much worse off without these key protections,’ the statement reads.

The full statement follows.

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is fundamental to our democracy and enables ordinary people, of all backgrounds, to hold the state and public bodies accountable. These rights are needed more than ever in an unstable world, with growing political polarisation and authoritarianism, environmental instability and technological upheaval, to ensure the dignity of us all.

The ECHR was born out of the horrors of World War II, with the UK playing a leading role, setting minimum standards which governments across Europe agreed to abide by. This has improved respect for human rights across Europe (no signatory has used the death penalty for 25 years) and facilitated cross-border cooperation on issues of joint interest, like crime and human trafficking.

In the UK, the ECHR and the Human Rights Act (HRA) have protected the rights of ordinary people every day up and down the country; from victims of sexual violence to LGBT+ service personnel, public interest journalists to mental health patients and victims of serious injustice (from Hillsborough to Windrush).

The ECHR helped bring peace finally in Northern Ireland, through the Good Friday Agreement, and has improved the quality of public services. We reject the narrative that human rights are not in the interests of the public – everyone in our society would be much worse off without these key protections.

In recent months, following a trend established over several years, the ECHR and HRA have increasingly come under fire from some leading politicians and media organisations. This has often been based on myths, over-simplifications, inaccuracies, and scaremongering, particularly around migration. Leaving the ECHR would not solve policy problems like the backlog of asylum cases, or people risking their lives through Channel crossings, but would bring about years of legal uncertainty, undermine our international position, and cause harm to the rights of both migrants in the UK and our wider communities.

We call on politicians to stop using our human rights as a scapegoat, level with the British public about the significant costs of ECHR withdrawal (such as the impact on the Good Friday Agreement) and end the escalating, irresponsible rhetoric targeting migrant and minoritised communities, which has devastating real-world consequences for people who are often already made vulnerable by wider social and economic marginalisation and stigmatisation.

We also call on the Government, whose party predecessors were architects of the HRA, to make the positive case for our human rights protections and how they empower ordinary people across the UK. It is an important part of our country’s safety net, not an inconvenience which must be tolerated. Its rights are common-sense, pragmatic protections which improve services at home and increase international cooperation abroad.

Now is the time for a full-throated defence of the ECHR and HRA. No one has human rights, unless we all have human rights.

Those pending federal cuts are just some of the challenges in a broader in a thicket of threats from the Trump administration New Jersey’s newest governor will confront.
“If you’re dealing with all of these sorts of federal funding cuts, it makes it a lot harder to put into place the ideas that you had when you came into office,” Shields said.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Murphy appointee, has been a persistent legal force against the Trump administration, most prominently in a national lawsuit to defend birthright citizenship.
Platkin has been among the more active Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration in its second term.","WASHINGTON — A host of issues, from rising health insurance premiums and looming federal cuts to social and economic programs, to the state’s budget deficit and the struggling NJ Transit system, will flood Mikie Sherrill in January when she is sworn in as the 57th governor of New Jersey.

Selecting a cabinet, including the role of attorney general, the state’s top law-enforcement post, and proposing a budget will be early tasks.

“The dominant thing that hits really early,” said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University, “is the state budget.”

“That’s the thing that overrides everything else,” Shields said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s going to have to happen quickly and it’s really complicated.”

Complicating the budget proposal — due in late February or early March — is a series of looming federal spending cuts and tax changes President Donald Trump and a Republican-majority Congress passed and signed into force, a sweeping law that rewrote dozens of federal tax incentives and will slash about $1 trillion in Medicaid funding and about $285 billion in food-aid over the next decade.

Those pending federal cuts are just some of the challenges in a broader in a thicket of threats from the Trump administration New Jersey’s newest governor will confront. Sherrill, a four-term member of Congress, former military pilot and moderate Democrat during her time in Washington, was elected Tuesday, besting Republican Jack Ciattarrelli to replace the term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

On health care, the incoming Sherrill administration will have to decipher new federal rules to implement the congressionally-mandated cuts to Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the low-income and disabled, and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a national anti-hunger program that 42 million Americans and 850,000 in New Jersey rely on.

A squeezed flow of federal money to New Jersey will increase pressure on a neophyte governor as they try to organize their administration and lead the state in a period when the Trump administration has been hostile to liberal states nationwide.

“If you’re dealing with all of these sorts of federal funding cuts, it makes it a lot harder to put into place the ideas that you had when you came into office,” Shields said.

At the tail end of the campaign, when Trump threatened to “terminate” funding for the Gateway Program, a $16-billion public works project decades in the works, Democrats jumped on the move, arguing Sherrill would try to rebuff similar budget moves from the Trump administration once sworn in.

State advocates want Sherrill to be a bulwark against Trump, whether he’s moving to cut money from an already-dug transportation project, expanding immigration detention sites in the state or expanding offshore oil-and-gas drilling, all policies the White House has floated.

“This will be the person who will hold the line while the federal government continues to fail us,” Nedia Morsy, state director of Make the Road New Jersey, an advocacy group, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “We’re looking for leadership that has a lot of clarity of purpose and real consistent direct alignment with the needs of working families.”

Morsy said stabilizing rents, freezing utility bills, protecting undocumented immigrants, creating a state heat safety standard for laborers and blocking the use of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in South Jersey are issues her group will focus on in the new administration.

“We expect the next governor to lean in and seek transparency and do everything possible that a converted military base camp turned into immigration detention camp will never see the light of day,” Morsy said.

For immigrant advocacy groups, protecting the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that limits state police from cooperating with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the chief federal agency tasked with arresting and holding the undocumented, is of paramount importance.

New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Murphy appointee, has been a persistent legal force against the Trump administration, most prominently in a national lawsuit to defend birthright citizenship.

“We are going to continue to do the work that matters to everyday New Jerseyans, but this matters too, in a state with 2 million immigrants,” Platkin told NJ Spotlight News in a May interview on the Supreme Court plaza after oral arguments on the case.

Platkin has been among the more active Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration in its second term. While Sherrill said she would not retain Platkin as attorney general, she could appoint a more progressive replacement.

Facing a president that has targeted critics, moved to limit free speech, ignored congressional budget law and undercut the rule of law, Sherrill must understand the gravity of the moment, Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU-NJ, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.

“This is the context in which the governor-elect is going to be reaching the state house,” Sinha said. “There’s no one thing that’s a panacea,” he said when asked about protecting New Jerseyans’ legal rights from federal threat. “But what we need to do is to turn New Jersey into what we’re calling a ‘firewall for freedom.’”

The new governor will also arrive in office just as health insurance premiums for people who receive coverage under the 2010 federal health law, known as Obamacare, are going to spike by about 16%, unless Congress steps in, something lawmakers in Washington are highly unlikely to do.

Topping off the list of threats to New Jersey emanating from Washington is the helter-skelter way in which Trump and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill have canceled, threatened to cancel, brought back and then cancelled again funding in Democratic-leaning states.

Several parents and aldermen said the armed agents with ICE on their jackets arrested the worker at the start of the school day. They don't know what to tell their children and in fact said as adults, they are upset by what transpired.

Witnesses said the teacher was chased inside the daycare center, not showing a warrant and not looking at her papers and despite the woman telling them she had documentation. She was then taken away.

Parents said they are upset and angry and worried about where agents might go next if they will go inside a private daycare facility where children were inside.

""You had agents with guns who were walking around the facility with teachers inside, with children inside and so we are of course demanding that she be released immediately,"" 47th Ward Alderman Matt Martin said.

""Schools are supposed to be places of safety, of security and not places where we have to talk to our children about why their teacher is being abducted and screaming and running away from agents with guns and masks while she is trying to enter the school,"" parent Tara Goodarzi said.

Parents described the scene with the children, teachers and parents crying. They said they are concerned about what happened and how to talk to their children what happened.

More parents and officials are expected to speak later Wednesday about the incident.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18116915_110525-wls-daycare-arrest-leah11a-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-05 13:02:27.138994

The administration’s attacks on Harvard and its proposed settlement with the university show that undermining academic freedom is exactly what the Trump administration is trying to do.
Subsequently, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced that the U.S. government would give no more grants to Harvard faculty.
It would also give the federal government astounding control over critical aspects of the university that are protected by the First Amendment and academic freedom.
The Trump administration has followed none of the legal requirements under Title VI for a cutoff of funds.","The Trump administration’s attack on higher education is unprecedented. Major universities—Columbia, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, Cornell, Northwestern—have had huge amounts of money illegally withheld. Billions of dollars of grants to faculty, including for medical research, have been unlawfully terminated. The administration has revoked student visas and made it more difficult for foreign students to get visas. The Budget Reconciliation Act of 2025, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, both increases the tax on endowments for universities and restricts the amount that students can borrow for their education.

All of this must be understood as an attempt to harm colleges and universities. Christopher Rufo, who is advising the Trump administration on matters of higher education, said that the goal is to cause universities to “feel existential terror” and put them in “recession.”

American universities are regarded as the greatest in the world and are the engines for social mobility, as well as scientific and medical advances. In large part, the assault on universities is based on a belief that schools are too liberal. Putting aside whether this is true, any effort by the administration to try and change the content of faculty teaching or writing is inimical to academic freedom. Academic freedom is meant to safeguard faculty from external control in their scholarship, their teaching, and their publicly disseminating their research.

The administration’s attacks on Harvard and its proposed settlement with the university show that undermining academic freedom is exactly what the Trump administration is trying to do. Initially, the Trump administration announced that it was cutting off $2 billion of funds to Harvard unless it agreed to federal oversight of its admissions, faculty hiring, and governance. Subsequently, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced that the U.S. government would give no more grants to Harvard faculty. Then the Trump administration announced that Harvard could enroll no foreign students. Twenty-seven percent of the students at Harvard are from other countries, and the financial impact on the school would be devastating.

The demands that the Trump administration has made of Harvard are stunning and ones that no university can or should agree to. They included changes in how the university is governed, including “reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty; reducing the power held by faculty (whether tenured or untenured) and administrators more committed to activism than scholarship.”

The Trump administration demanded changes in faculty hiring and student admissions, including mandating “viewpoint diversity in admissions and hiring.” This included that Harvard “shall satisfy the federal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse.” The letter states, “Every department or field found to lack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by hiring a critical mass of new faculty within that department or field who will provide viewpoint diversity.”

Although viewpoint diversity, like all efforts at diversity, is laudable, the government requiring that faculty be hired or students be admitted based on their views clearly violates the First Amendment. It would also give the federal government astounding control over critical aspects of the university that are protected by the First Amendment and academic freedom. The demand letter from the Trump administration also requires the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, demands a new system of student discipline, and directs the punishment of students who had participated in particular demonstrations. These are matters for the university, not the federal government, to control.

The Trump administration has no authority under any law to impose these requirements. The ostensible basis for the initial letter to Harvard was Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which says that recipients of federal funds cannot discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. The claim was that Harvard violated Title VI by being deliberately indifferent to antisemitism. Harvard has thus far resisted these demands and is challenging the cutoff of funds in federal district court.

But virtually none of what the Trump administration has demanded is about alleged antisemitism on campus. It is about the Trump administration using the enormous power of the federal government to try and devastate one of the most prestigious universities in the country. The Trump administration has followed none of the legal requirements under Title VI for a cutoff of funds. Under that law, there must be notice and a hearing and a finding of deliberate indifference before funds are cut off. There must be 30 days’ notice to both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the cutoff of funds. There must be an opportunity to correct the violations. And any cutoff has to be limited to the program found to be in violation of Title VI. The Trump administration has done none of this.

The Trump administration’s actions against Harvard are to send a message to schools across the country, in every state and local community, about what they face if they do not cower to its demands. President Trump knows that if he can force Harvard to yield to his control, every state, local, and private educational institution will get the message that it must capitulate. Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, speaking of what was done to Harvard, stated, “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”

What the Trump administration is doing is a direct assault on the independence of universities. It is an effort to control who is on the faculty, what they write, and how they teach. This strikes at the very heart of academic freedom.

So far, the federal courts have stopped the Trump administration’s assault on Harvard.

But stopping Trump’s attack on Harvard is not enough. Members of Congress—Republicans and Democrats—must denounce the attack on higher education. Leaders of every university across the country must speak out. The United States has the greatest university system in the world, which is what attracts students from across the globe to our communities. Donald Trump must not be allowed to destroy it.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-harvard-2063385442.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:17:46.904997

Trump slams Mamdani's New York victory: 'It's common sense or communism'

The president continued to undermine the results of New York’s mayoral election. He’s yet to reference the new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, by name. But he’s used the historic victory as a way to color the future direction of the Democratic party.

“If you want to see what congressional Democrats wish to do to America, just look at the result of yesterday’s election in New York, where their party installed a communist,” Trump said, inciting a series of boos as a result. “Now the Democrats are so extreme that Miami will soon be the refuge for those fleeing communism in New York.”

He went on to summarize the situation at large: “The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear – we have a choice between communism and common sense.”

The Federal Aviation Administration said it’s planning to cut 10% of flights at major airports if a deal isn’t reached on the government shutdown. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy made the threat at a news conference on Wednesday, saying the reduction in flights could come as soon as Friday.

“As we start to implement this draw down in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high volume traffic markets,” FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said, according to CNN. “We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules.”

Bedford didn’t offer details on which states and cities those 40 airports are located, but said that the drawdown will be “prescriptive” and “surgical”.

During the historic 36 days of government shutdown, airports have seen air traffic control staffing shortages and delays in flights. Those employees must work during the shutdown, but aren’t paid until it’s over. CNN estimates that more than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, which is more than four times than the same days last year.

Democrats take a victory lap after the party notches coast-to-coast wins

Lauren Gambino

Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, held a call with reporters on Wednesday, declaring: “Make no mistake, the Democratic party is back.

“The Democratic Party is all gas, no brakes,” Martin added.

“We made it clear we don’t want gilded ballrooms. We want lower healthcare costs,” he said. “We don’t want marble bathrooms. We want lower energy bills. We don’t want Great Gatsby parties. We want kids to be able to eat dinner every night.”

Martin credited the candidates with a relentless focus on affordability issues – from Zohran Mamdani’s freeze on rent in New York City to Mikie Sherrill’s day-one state of emergency on utility costs in New Jersey.

He also touted the party’s inroads with young people, and particularly young men, a demographic group Democrats have struggled with. It was his hope that the resounding victory on California’s redistricting measure creates a “chilling effect” on Republican states weighing gerrymanders at Trump’s request.

“This is not your grandfather’s Democratic party. We will meet you in every single state that you decide to try to steal more seats,” he said.

Tuesday’s election results point to voter discontent with Donald Trump, according to a new poll by the Associated Press. The news organization surveyed more than 17,000 voters in states that held elections this week and found most disapproved of Trump’s performance as president.

In Virginia and New Jersey, slightly less than half of voters said Trump was a factor in their voting. But the majority of those who did cite the president as a factor said their vote was to oppose him – four in 10 voters. Similar patterns were seen in New York City and California.

Republicans mostly said Trump wasn’t a factor in their vote, despite saying they approve of his job performance. In California, only one in 10 voters said they were voting to support Trump.

Immigration was a hot-button issue for many voters who said Trump’s aggressive approach had “gone too far”. This was most starkly seen in New York City and California, where about six in 10 voters said their state shouldn’t cooperate with the White House on immigration enforcement.

Maine representative Jared Golden announces he won't seek re-election, leaving Democrats vulnerable

Jared Golden, the Maine Democratic representative, announced today that he won’t seek re-election to Congress in 2025.

“I have grown tired of the increasing incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community – behavior that, too often, our political leaders exhibit themselves,” the congressman wrote in a column for the Bangor Daily News. “Additionally, recent incidents of political violence have made me reassess the frequent threats against me and my family.”

Golden said that while he’s confident he would win if he were to run again, “what has become apparent to me is that I now dread the prospect of winning”, also citing the ongoing government shutdown – now the longest on record – as part of his decision. “The nonstop, hyperbolic accusations and recriminations by both sides reveal just how broken Congress has become,” he said.

Golden’s decision to step aside in a district that supported both him and Donald Trump in 2020 and 2024 poses a challenge for Democrats. To keep the seat competitive, they’ll need to find a candidate who can connect with rural voters in a state with a strong libertarian streak.

Here's a recap of the day so far

The US supreme court appeared skeptical of the legal basis of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariff regime on Wednesday after justices questioned the president’s authority to impose the levies. The question at the heart of the case is whether the Trump administration’s tariffs violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law which only gives the president authority to “regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency”. Today, even conservative justices sounded doubtful of the strength of the Trump administration’s position. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said Chief Justice John Roberts. Lawyers for the small businesses challenging the White House said that the president’s actions were unprecedented. “They are tariffing the entire world in peacetime, and they are doing it asserting a power that no president in our history has ever had,” said attorney Neal Katyal.

As he hosted Republican senators at the White House, Donald Trump offered some initial thoughts on the Democratic victories across the country on election night. “Last night, it was not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas. But I don’t think it was good for Republicans,” the president said. “I’m not sure it was good for anybody.” Later, while speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, Trump particularly disparaged Zohran Mamdani’s historic win in New York City. “The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear – we have a choice between communism and common sense,” he said, while mispronouncing the new mayor’s name.

On Capitol Hill, and day 36 of the government shutdown (now the longest on record), Republicans continued to rebuke Democrats for failing to pass a stopgap funding bill. House speaker Mike Johnson also used his daily press conference to both downplay and foreshadow what Tuesday’s election results suggest going forward. “There’s no surprises. What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue. We all saw that coming,” the speaker said, before stating the importance of maintaining a Republican majority in the midterm elections. “If we lose the majority in the House, and this radical element of the Democrat party were able to take over, we’ve already seen that movie. They will try to end the Trump administration,” Johnson said.

Meanwhile, Trump had choice words for GOP lawmakers, as he pushed for them to blow up the filibuster. Despite reticence from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, the president pushed the virtues of abolishing the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate on legislation. His argument largely rests on the grounds that Democrats would do the same, and would use it to advance their own agenda if they were given the opportunity. “We have to get the country going. We will pass legislation at levels you’ve never seen before, and it will be impossible to beat us,” he said. “They’ll [Democrats] most likely never attain power, because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”

Republicans in California on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging a high-stakes redistricting measure that could help flip up to five congressional seats for Democrats.

The suit, filed by Republican assembly member David Tangipa, 18 California voters and the state Republican party, in the US district court for the central district of California argues that the new maps are unconstitutional because they were drawn to increase the voting power of a particular racial group. It asks the court to block the new maps from taking effect, at least temporarily.

The measure, Proposition 50, was approved by voters on Tuesday evening, in a decisive victory for Democrats. The plan temporarily gives the power to draw congressional districts to the California legislature, allowing it to adopt maps that will help Democrats pick up five seats in the US House of Representatives.

Mike Columbo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that California Democrats drew the maps to increase the power of Latino voters.

While the supreme court allows states to use race as a factor in drawing political maps, Columbo argued that the intent was to help minority voters elect the candidates of their choice. In California, he noted, Hispanic voters represent the largest ethnic group.

“There is no majority race in California more than Hispanics,” Columbo said. “Hispanics have had fantastic success in electing candidates of their choice. Accordingly, California cannot meet this exception.”

Democrats have expressed confidence that the maps would withstand a legal challenge.

Trump’s address today in Miami is sounding more like a campaign rally, as he responds to the Democratic victories across the country after Tuesday’s election.

“Let’s see how a communist does in New York. We’re going to see how that works out. We’ll help them. We want New York to be successful. We’ll help them a little bit,” the president said, after Zohran Mamdani was elected as the city’s youngest, first Muslim mayor.

Donald Trump’s speech started off with a lengthy self-congratulation for winning his second term of office exactly one year ago today.

“We rescued the economy … we saved our country,” he insisted, before recounting his pre-election photoshoot with a garbage truck, and serving hamburgers in a McDonald’s restaurant.

“This is the golden age of America,” he said, touting a slew of recent trade deals with other nations, and insisting they would net $21tn for the US economy in one year. He claimed to have removed 600,000 Americans from food stamp aid, and that 2 million more were working than when he took office.

“Prices are coming down very fast,” he said. “We’re going to have a bigger, better, stronger economy than my first four years.”

He’s offered the greatest hits of many of his usual lines: extolling his 2024 win as the most “consequential election victory in American history”, declaring his second administration as the beginning of a “golden age of America” and baselessly claiming the 2020 election was stolen.

He also disparaged the results of the New York mayoral election. “Watch what happens in New York, terrible,” Trump said, not referring to Zohran Mamdani by name. “And I hope it doesn’t happen, but you’re going to see it.”

He’ll have only two because they will move to impeach him, probably on the first day of the new Congress in January 2027, and they will try to systematically unwind all the important reforms that we’ve done for the American people.”

“We need to focus on the home front. The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day,” Vance wrote.

I talked with leftwing commentator Hasan Piker on the phone earlier today, fresh off a night of celebrating Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York.

Mamdani’s message can be replicated around the country, Piker said, despite the contention from some that the democratic socialist’s platform would be too radical for other parts of the country.

“This is probably the 700th time saying this, and not just about Zohran in general, not even just last night. This is the message of my entire political advocacy. This is the message of my entire political career as a commentator, as someone who works with organizers and activists,” Piker said.

“Yes, Zohran’s message is universal. It is applicable, and I think as long as you localize it to address the ailments that people feel, the issues that people feel in whatever locality, in whatever state that you are running for, as long as you center working-class struggles and affordability at the heart of your campaign, you will definitely win.”

Health Many recent federal policy initiatives about transgender people have tried to limit access to transgender health care.
This year, Connecticut prohibited knowingly discriminating on account of gender identity in health care and in long-term care facilities.
This rule was ultimately finalized by HHS in June 2025, but Colorado and Vermont both passed mandates for health plans to continue to cover transgender health care.
New York City’s 2026 budget contains new funding of $2.5 million to support transgender health care programs that lost federal support.","In the first five months of Donald Trump’s second term, federal actions undermining the civil rights and humanity of vulnerable people have been numerous and deeply harmful. Many of these actions focused on transgender people, while others harmed Black and brown people, immigrants, pregnant people, and others. While this article focuses on government actions based on gender identity, it’s important to note that many transgender people are also people of color and immigrants and can become pregnant. They may suffer compounded discrimination as a result of the intersectionality of these or other factors.

To help fill these gaps, a coalition of moderate and progressive states, cities, and counties has taken decisive action to push back. These coalitions include Nevada and Vermont, which have republican governors, and Arizona and Wisconsin, which have republican legislatures. This broad coalition of states demonstrates an understanding that transgender people live everywhere, contribute to our local economies and tax base, and are best able to be part of our communities when accorded basic rights.

The importance of the federal government should not be underestimated. However, residents are often closer to state and local government; they attend school, get a driver’s license, and find health care. Transgender people do all of those things too but often face harassment or mistreatment when we do, especially if the way we look doesn’t closely conform to “traditional” gender expectations. But transgender people are not new and have been part of every tradition and society. What is new is society’s acknowledgment of transgender people’s existence. It’s also important to remember that transgender people’s humanity is not dependent on acknowledgment by any government, and, like anyone, it is our community that ultimately helps us to be proud and free.

In this article, we review state and local actions that push back on federal policy seeking to remove protections against discrimination based on gender identity. Examples include identification documents, education, health, and housing, and we look at them through the lenses of agency guidance, comments on federal rules, legislation, and lawsuits. They demonstrate work by states, cities, and counties to protect transgender people as valuable contributors to our communities.

Nondiscrimination

States, cities, and counties have taken notice of the discrimination that transgender people face in our daily lives and have sought to address it through state laws and municipal ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations. When media coverage concentrates on federal limitations on rights, it’s helpful for states to remind residents about state nondiscrimination laws that exist independent of federal attacks. Maryland’s attorney general and the Illinois Department of Human Rights both issued guidance to transgender residents about state legal protections in health care, schools, employment, housing, identification documents, and more.

Education

The Trump administration attempted to limit federal civil rights that help protect transgender students from discrimination. These federal actions also undercut equity practices to ensure that students receive an education free from discrimination. In the wake of executive actions threatening diversity, equity, and inclusion, a group of attorneys general in 14 states, plus D.C., issued guidance reminding schools in the states of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, plus D.C., that those directives shouldn’t affect curriculum that addresses gender identity. This memo followed a document issued jointly by Rhode Island’s attorney general and commissioner of the Department of Education about schools’ responsibility to safeguard the rights of students based on gender identity.

Identification Documents

Identification documents are critically important to access public life. When transgender people cannot access documents that correctly identify us, we are at risk of discrimination, mistreatment, and violence when we are outed as transgender. States play an outsize role here because they set policy related to driver’s licenses and birth certificates, which are often needed to obtain a passport.

With the Trump administration’s announcement that the federal government will only acknowledge two sexes assigned at birth, the State Department’s policy and procedure on changing the gender marker on passports abruptly ended. A coalition of attorneys general in 12 states—California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington—submitted a comment in response to these proposed changes on passport applications. The states discussed how the changes would conflict with state policy on gender markers. The changes also create confusion as states implement the REAL ID Act requirements for air travel and access to federal spaces.

Health

Many recent federal policy initiatives about transgender people have tried to limit access to transgender health care. Not every transgender person wants medical procedures, but for many, access to this care is medically necessary. When the Trump administration pulled back rules about gender identity discrimination in health care, states responded by ensuring that residents are protected from such discrimination under state law. This year, Connecticut prohibited knowingly discriminating on account of gender identity in health care and in long-term care facilities. Nevada requires agencies that provide personal care services to post a policy stating that they will not discriminate based on gender identity.

In one of the first actions to push back against the Trump administration, in February 2025 a multistate coalition of 14 state attorneys general representing California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin released a “Statement on Protecting Access to Gender-Affirming Care.” Attorneys general in California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York released specific guidance to health care providers about their obligation to provide care in a nondiscriminatory manner, followed by a multistate lawsuit against the executive order that requires agencies to work to deny funding for this needed care. States also sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the withdrawal of grant funding by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Homeland Security for sharing sensitive Medicaid data, which they said would deter people seeking transgender health care from enrolling in Medicaid. A broader coalition of 21 states (including the states mentioned above, plus Arizona, New Mexico, and D.C.) submitted a comment on a proposed federal rule that would prevent states from designating transgender health care services as essential health benefits in their Affordable Care Act plans. This rule was ultimately finalized by HHS in June 2025, but Colorado and Vermont both passed mandates for health plans to continue to cover transgender health care.

While information about a patient’s transgender health care is protected by the federal privacy law known as HIPAA, states have shown concern that federal regulators will seek that information to penalize providers, insurers, or perhaps even the patients themselves and their families for providing, paying for, seeking, or receiving care, even when that care is legal in that state. In response, Vermont specifically restricted the release of protected health information to any government entity if there is reason to believe it will be used to investigate those services, as long as the services are legal in that state. Vermont and Colorado also restricted any public entity from expending personnel time or resources in a federal investigation seeking to impose liability for the provision of those services that are otherwise legal under state law.

States have also acted to limit the health data that is collected about patients. Maine passed a law to prevent data about gender identity from being entered into the electronic health records of minors. King County, Washington, similarly passed an ordinance limiting the collection of gender identity information to the minimum amount needed to fulfill a legitimate agency purpose.

Perhaps the most impactful actions so far in 2025 have been the provision of state and local funding to build the capacity of communities to continue to provide transgender health care services in the wake of federal funding restrictions. Connecticut’s budget establishes an account for grants to nonprofit organizations that provide funding for those services or for the costs associated with travel to obtain such care. Massachusetts established an Affirming Health Care Trust Fund with a $1 million investment. New York City’s 2026 budget contains new funding of $2.5 million to support transgender health care programs that lost federal support.

Housing

Some young transgender people face family rejection that can lead to losing their housing, and many transgender people face discrimination in seeking a place to live. It can be especially difficult for transgender people to access emergency shelters that are separated by sex. New York City (NYC) added $5 million in new funding for transgender youth housing support services in its 2026 budget. Additionally, NYC joined San Francisco and Boston, plus a coalition of counties, to sue the Department of Housing and Urban Development for conditioning the receipt of grant funds for shelters for people without housing on an agreement not to use the funds to promote “gender ideology.” The municipal coalition argued that the grant conditions would require them to violate nondiscrimination law by disallowing the legal recognition of gender identity in shelters and requiring shelters to exclude transgender people. They also argued that people who need access to shelters would be dissuaded from seeking services if they were unable to use their identified gender to do so.

Conclusion

States, cities, and counties have used administrative, judicial, and legislative tactics to push back against federal limitations on the civil rights of transgender people. State and local governments are showing leadership and demonstrating a commitment to the late Representative John Lewis’s command to “Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.”",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-transgender-flag-1501550506.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 15:17:49.318822

Jason Crow (CO-06) and Mike Turner (OH-10), today sent a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump demanding answers about a series of lethal U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.

In the letter, the lawmakers — all members of the House Armed Services Committee — underscored the importance of holding traffickers accountable while also upholding America’s legal and moral standards.

The letter asks President Trump to clarify the legal basis for the strikes, whether the administration intends to seek congressional authorization, whether the individuals being targeted truly pose an active threat to the United States, and what processes exist to verify targets. It also calls for a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee on how individuals and vessels are identified and what post-strike review mechanisms are in place.

“No one questions the threat that drug cartels pose to American families,” said Congressman Moulton. “But launching lethal military strikes outside of a declared conflict raises serious legal and strategic questions that the administration has repeatedly failed to answer. The American people deserve clear answers about the legal, moral, and policy rationale behind these strikes.""

“Many Americans know someone who has died from a fentanyl overdose,” said Congressman Bacon. ""I lost three younger brothers to drug and alcohol abuse, so I appreciate President Trump’s willingness to take on the cartels and stop the deadly flow of drugs killing 100,000 Americans each year. But we must ensure the President is acting within the law and basing every decision on accurate intelligence. The Administration should come to Congress, make the legal case, present their intelligence, and assure the American people that any military action is grounded in both authority and accountability. If those standards are met, I’m confident Congress and the American people will stand behind decisive action to confront this crisis.”

The lawmakers emphasized in the letter that the United States must remain committed to its values even while confronting the serious problem of narcotics trafficking.

“We support efforts to reduce the flow of deadly drugs,” the lawmakers wrote. “But every U.S. military action must adhere to the legal, moral, and ethical standards that set America apart from its adversaries.""

The lawmakers requested a response from the administration by November 14, 2025.

On June 27, 1980, Jose Artiga was 23 and two semesters shy of an engineering degree when his family received word that far-right death squads were coming for him and four other college students in his hometown of San Martin, El Salvador.

Leer en español

El Salvador was a year into a civil war that pitted the paramilitary death squads, funded in part by the U.S. government, against Marxist-Leninist guerilla forces and the civilians who supported them. Since the United States did not recognize the Salvadoran civil war, and its role in it, those who fled to the U.S. were not granted refugee status and were instead considered economic migrants.

After his family told him about the order to kill him, Artiga was out of the country by 5 p.m. By that time the other college students were already dead, but their relatives “couldn’t recognize the bodies because they were cut into pieces,” Artiga said.

It took Artiga three months to get to Austin, Texas, and another year-and-a-half to get to San Francisco, where he was given sanctuary at the Most Holy Redeemer Church in the Castro and devoted himself to the solidarity movement in his homeland. In March 1982, Artiga participated in a hunger fast at St. Boniface Church in downtown San Francisco to draw attention to the Salvadoran crisis, making the local news.

The Rev. Gus Schultz, pastor of Berkeley’s University Lutheran Chapel, now considered the father of Berkeley’s sanctuary movement, took notice and invited Artiga to a press conference.

On March 24, 1982, Artiga joined three other Salvadoran asylum seekers as the ULC and four other Berkeley churches — St. John’s Presbyterian, St. Joseph the Worker, St. Mark’s Episcopal and Trinity Methodist — gathered in front of University Lutheran Chapel and announced their commitment to sanctuary and created East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, a grassroots collective to coordinate their efforts to shelter, aid and advocate for the refugees. Reading from their newly adopted covenant, which their congregations had to approve, the churches promised to “provide sanctuary — support, protection and advocacy — to the El Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees who request safe haven out of fear and persecution upon return to their homeland.”

The event made the news and it made history, reinforcing Berkeley’s role as the birthplace of the modern-day sanctuary movement, which has its roots in the Vietnam War. The covenant became a model for religious groups around the country.

“What was powerful was what developed after that,” Artiga said. “People began talking about the testimony of a refugee to see if the U.S. policy was justified or not. The U.S. was sending $1 million a day to keep that war going. The questioning of that policy started happening then.”

Forty-three years after that press conference outside University Lutheran, Berkeley churches and East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, now one of the largest pro-asylum programs in the U.S., continue to work on behalf of asylum seekers. Jose Artiga, meanwhile, has returned to the ULC, this time as a tenant heading a social justice organization serving Salvadorans.

All of these efforts, however, are taking place in a more hostile political environment. Instead of testifying as their predecessors did, immigrants today are spending less time in public. President Donald Trump ran a campaign that included racist rhetoric and conspiracy theories targeting migrants, and in its first few weeks the administration has arrested almost 9,000 immigrants and deported over 5,693 people. Because of the Berkeley movement spearheaded in 1982, a larger network of activists that contains not only religious organizations, but hundreds of municipalities across the country that have declared themselves sanctuaries, from the City of Berkeley to the State of California, are prepared to push back against the federal response.

“The Trump administration is attempting to shut down sanctuary, but this is actually not possible,” said Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the Berkeley-based EBSC, who has worked for the organization since 2017. “Sanctuary is the spirit of humans coming together to stand up for what is morally and ethically right.”

The origins of sanctuary

The term “sanctuary” was first used to denote a sacred religious space that was first in the outdoors and then in buildings such as Hebrew temples and the sacred lodges of the Algonkin and Sioux, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. In Greek and Roman times, fugitives sought sanctuary in temples. Early Christian churches began offering their own protections. By the end of the fourth century, sanctuary was part of Roman law, making it illegal for the secular authorities to remove even a murder suspect who faced the death penalty.

In the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Quasimodo saves Esmeralda from execution by carrying her into Notre Dame and claiming sanctuary. Clergy relied on the practice to harbor slaves fleeing the American South during the 19th century and to protect European Jews fleeing the Holocaust a century later. The protection of a church was symbolic, a stall tactic providing fugitives more time to negotiate with alleged victims or go into permanent exile.

In the Bay Area, there are around 40 sanctuary congregations, according to the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, a statewide network based in Oakland. In light of the recent deportations, the organization was joined by 43 faith organizations and dozens of religious leaders on Feb. 19 to publicly reaffirm their commitment to sanctuary at a St. Mark’s Lutheran Church in San Francisco ceremony.

After Trump’s victory in 2016, about 400 churches nationwide declared themselves sanctuaries, bringing the country’s total number of sanctuary churches to 800, according to the nonprofit group Church World Service.

Though the ancient tradition of sanctuary has appealed to both religious and secular communities, the concept of establishing sanctuary cities and states through legislation is relatively new in the United States.

The federal government has the right to enforce immigration policies, but local laws can set standards on how its law enforcement and other employees interact with federal authorities and define safe spaces within the community, thwarting federal efforts.

After U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) proclaimed arrests would now take place in “sensitive areas,” like churches, hospitals and schools, the Berkeley City Council reaffirmed its commitment to protect such places on Jan. 21. Berkeley’s school board and rent board have made similar reaffirmations.

According to estimates from the Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey, roughly 16,000 Berkeley residents are immigrants without U.S. citizenship. That population includes legal permanent residents, and visa holders, such as professors and students. If mass deportations are carried out the way Trump envisions, the focus would be on undocumented immigrants and other groups with statuses that rely on executive orders, such as recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status. Alameda County has an estimated 107,000 immigrant residents who have no legal status. Mass deportations, advocates say, would separate families, disrupt businesses that rely on immigrant workforces, and inundate local courts and jails.

In addition to protecting immigrants on moral and ethical grounds, municipalities have been motivated to enact sanctuary policies because studies have shown that crime has decreased in places that have such policies.

“People aren’t afraid to contact local law enforcement if something is happening,” Hoffman said. “If people feel like the local law enforcement is going to turn them over to ICE, they’re not going to call.”

Roots in the anti-Vietnam War movement

While Berkeley’s role of providing sanctuary is often connected to the plight of refugees from Central and South America, its roots grew from protests during the Vietnam War. From the beginning, the Berkeley sanctuary movement challenged U.S. policy.

“The very first episode of sanctuary wasn’t about immigration at all, it was about conscientious objectors who were stuck in military service,” said Bennett Falk, who had been involved with the local sanctuary movement at University Lutheran Chapel, first as a seminarian and then as a layperson in the early 1970s and 1980s, when Schultz, who died in 2007, was pastor.

Around 1970, one of the members of the congregation burned his draft card on a Sunday in a parking lot behind the chapel, Falk said.

“That whole procedure was observed by the FBI, who were across the street on Haste. We then all went into the church and when they came out after the church service, the FBI arrested him. We weren’t worried about them invading our space,” Falk said.

In 1971, when the aircraft carrier the Coral Sea was set to ship off from Alameda, at least 1,000 members of the 4,500-member crew had formed an organization called Stop Our Ship and signed an anti-war petition. A two- to three-day standoff ensued, pitting federal and state law enforcement against anti-war protestors, the ULC and the City of Berkeley. The city council made history by adopting Resolution 44,784, calling itself a City of Refuge, the first in the nation, for any crew members and designating the ULC as a city-approved sanctuary.

On Nov. 13, 1971, the Berkeley Daily Gazette reported that some 1,200 demonstrators who had shown up in Alameda to support the objectors were met by “a massive show” of local, regional, state and federal security. The incident ended peacefully, but 35 sailors did end up going AWOL and one person (not yet in the military) sought sanctuary in the church, according to the Gazette.

On Nov. 9, Schultz held a press conference in the church basement with five of the sailors, according to Found SF, drawing media attention and support from peace activists like Joan Baez and Dorothy Day.

“There were men from the Coral Sea who were through here,” Schultz told the Gazette. “They took advantage of the sanctuary that was offered. They had legal counsel and they had information as to what the church could and could not provide.”

Church council president Susan Ramshaw vowed that the church would continue to provide sanctuary to GIs or “anyone who would like to seek counsel.”

Because of this experience, Schultz thought he could apply the same protections for the many refugees who began flooding into the Bay Area, said the Rev. Robert McKenzie, pastor of St. John’s Presbyterian from 1966-82.

In January 1982, St. John’s received a request to house a couple from El Salvador and their baby because the church had previously taken in two political refugees from Argentina as part of a U.S. resettlement program under the Carter administration. By that time, the government considered those who harbored or assisted asylum seekers lawbreakers.

“Declaring sanctuary meant that we were committing ourselves to illegally care for these refugees,” McKenzie said. “Though we had taken in this couple and provided them with a place to stay, we did not formally say we were resisting the government to do so. The proposal then was for us to challenge the government and its policies against refugees from El Salvador. We were going to stand with these refugees and make it a very public thing to do.”

Joining the Berkeley churches in their groundbreaking efforts was Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Arizona, which signed onto the movement shortly after ULC’s governing board declared sanctuary. Southside Presbyterian likewise held a press conference when the Berkeley churches made their announcement on March 24, 1982.

Carrying on — despite the threat of arrest

For those assisting asylum seekers, the threat of arrest was real. In 1985, 11 members of the Tucson church were arrested on felony charges for smuggling Salvadoran refugees across the border. A year later, a federal jury acquitted three of the workers, while eight were convicted.

“Nobody was arrested here, although we lived under the threat of a $5,000 fine and up to 10 years in jail for harboring what they called ‘illegal aliens,’” said the Rev. Marilyn Chilcote, McKenzie’s wife, who served as assistant pastor at St. John’s from 1981-84. “For us they were just human beings fleeing for their lives. We would hide these people if necessary. ”

After that, the five congregations participating in Berkeley grew to 34, while another dozen in Tucson joined, including non-Christian denominations, McKenzie said. “It really took off.”

Soon the initial idea of using the church building to protect asylum seekers grew into a movement to send church delegations to Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras to see for themselves what the situation was like.

“Sending delegations of church people to the camps and parts of El Salvador was an act of solidarity and a way of understanding what the pressures were on them,” McKenzie said. Between 1980-85, around 660,000 refugees were resettled in the United States.

In June 1982, Chilcote spent a week at Mesa Grande, the United Nations refugee camp in Honduras, with Jean Getchell, the wife of the pastor of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, the Rev. Philip Getchell. The camp housed 5,000 refugees, some of whom described how the Salvadoran government was wiping out entire villages, Chilcote said. By the war’s end in 1992, the death squads would be responsible for killing tens of thousands of Salvadorans.

When the ULC’s Falk visited the camp, also in 1982, his delegation arrived about an hour and a half before the Honduran military shut it down.

“We couldn’t get out for a week-and-a-half,” Falk said. “We were there to welcome refugees and get them into the U.N. camp. It was a tenuous situation. We were unarmed and suddenly there was the Honduran military.”

McKenzie said that sanctuary churches from California, Oregon and Washington also operated a “refugee caravan” that drove refugees in a convoy of up to 33 cars from Los Angeles to Vancouver, Canada, with overnight stays at churches along the way.

“It was openly and at great risk because we could have been picked up at any time,” Chilcote said. “We were really daring the INS,” the [Immigration and Naturalization Service], “today’s ICE — to come and get us.”

Vancouver is where the two St. John’s asylum seekers ended up — and were offered citizenship.

By 1986, The New York Times reported that the Bay Area was home to an estimated 80,000 Salvadorans, most of whom arrived since 1980, with some 40 churches and related organizations providing services. By that time the sanctuary movement had spread to more than 200 congregations around the country.

As Salvadoran and Guatemalan asylum seekers continued to pour into Berkeley, the city council in February 1985 approved a resolution declaring all of Berkeley a sanctuary for undocumented refugees, paving the way for the creation of “sanctuary cities” nationwide.

Facing the latest threats

Today, four of the five Berkeley churches that became sanctuaries in 1982 remain.

Trinity Methodist closed in 2020 due to a dwindling congregation and a building that needed extensive seismic repairs. Some of the former members of Trinity still meet on Zoom and continue to this day to make quilts to donate to East Bay Sanctuary Covenant. St. Mark’s Episcopal and St. Joseph the Worker, a Catholic church, does not offer programs for migrants, yet their pastors said they remain committed to assisting congregants if help is needed.

St. Joseph the Worker likely boasts the largest South and Central American population in Berkeley, as the people from those regions are predominantly Catholic. At Spanish mass on Sunday, Feb. 9, Rev. Alberto Perez alerted parishioners to online resources for migrants that the Diocese of Oakland provides.

St. John’s and the ULC, meanwhile, have continued to assist asylum seekers.

“We haven’t really stopped,” said the Rev. Max Lynn, St. John’s pastor for the past 21 years.

The church is currently helping a Colombian family and two large Guatemalan families, as well as a Guatemalan woman whose seven-year quest for asylum has so far cost the church between $25,000 and $35,000.

When refugees show up, Lynn said, they have nothing and are in “deep, heavy need.” The church provides housing, clothes, furniture, school enrollment, school tutoring and legal aid assistance, among other services.

Although the church does have an apartment and has housed refugees, Lynn discovered that that wasn’t the best way to help.

“In the early days of sanctuary the idea was that the sanctuary is going to be in the church. We wanted to make a statement,” he said. “But pretty quickly two things happened: We realized that the biggest need was legal help, and that the best way to get migrants established is to get them into the Latino community so they can find work.”

“In general, Berkeley’s a university town with a bunch of rich people, so it’s expensive,” he said. “There’s really not a core community of Latinos in Berkeley. People want to go where the rent is cheap and there’s a whole bunch of people from their own culture.”

So the church works closely with its sister parish, First Presbyterian Hispanic of Oakland (Primera Iglesia Presbyterian Church) to find apartments in immigrant communities like Oakland’s Fruitvale, where people can also find work more quickly.

Since 2013, St. John’s has also provided down payments on houses for about 70 immigrants and assisted 77 others with housing. About six years ago, the church helped an 18-member extended family of K’iche’ Mayan indigenous Americans from Guatemala buy a house in the Fruitvale section of Oakland they had been renting by rounding up investors and acting as an intermediary.

At the ULC, the pastor, the Rev. Jeff Johnson had a church apartment created in 2016 for Bay Area residents who were worried about then-candidate Trump’s disparaging comments about immigrants. At a press conference, he called for the need for such sanctuaries “in a time of increased xenophobia, where refugees are derided, scapegoated and blamed.”

The number of people who have taken sanctuary within the church spiked between 2015 and 2018-19, when ULC helped at least a dozen people.

Artiga, who was offered sanctuary for his testimony at ULC back in 1982, is now the executive director of the SHARE (Salvadoran Humanitarian Aid, Research and Education) Foundation, a justice organization that supports the Salvadorans’ fight for human rights, economic sustainability and justice, which has an office in the church.

In 1983 he married Eileen Purcell, co-founder of the Archdiocesan Latin America Task Force and the Committee to Stop the Deportations in San Francisco, after she interviewed him about his work. It was her endorsement that led to his sanctuary at Most Holy Redeemer. He became a U.S. citizen in 1992.

As Artiga’s story illustrates, providing immigrants with a place to stay is part of the effort, said Falk, but they also need assistance with the complicated immigration and naturalization process, which churches typically don’t provide.

That’s where the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant comes in.

Expanding the work the five churches began

Founded in 1982 by the five Berkeley sanctuary churches, East Bay Sanctuary Covenant started with an $85,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Chilcote from St. John’s served as director from 1984 to 1988.

“We had representatives from all the congregations to govern the EBSC. We had meetings with 150 volunteers who provided social services, rides to doctors, translation services, helping people set up apartments, providing clothing and funneling donations that came in and services that were helpful to refugees,” Chilcote said. “We didn’t have money to hand out. We had people to help them.”

With a staff of three employees and a budget of about $100,000, EBSC operated out of the basement of the Trinity Methodist Church for 43 years, even after the church closed. The organization moved its offices to the Berkeley School of Theology in August 2024.

“The most important part for me was the advocacy work,” Chilcote said. She set up a speakers bureau and recruited and trained 40 speakers who shared their experiences as asylum seekers with Northern California churches, advocacy and community groups.

What was once a membership coalition of faith-based groups has broadened into a “multi-disciplinary effort,” said Hoffman. But we “stand on the shoulders of those early activists.”

According to its Year in Review, EBSC served more than 12,000 people in 2024 through its hotline, legal clinic, outreach and organizing and had a 98% success rate in winning clients’ asylum cases. The group has also connected 860 people to public benefits like Medi-Cal and CalFresh and provided legal and social services to 650 unaccompanied minors.

EBSC’s mission is to provide legal, social and advocacy programs that serve immigrant communities, helping to create a pathway to citizenship and promote more compassionate immigration policies. The organization has a staff of 35 and an annual budget of $3.5 million.

EBSC serves immigrants from 72 countries, including those in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Nearly all clients are low-income and most reside in the Bay Area, Hoffman said, but also from other parts of California, as well as Oregon, Washington and “a sliver of Nevada.”

“We’ve always been part of both the local, state and national efforts to protect asylum,” Hoffman said.

EBSC is currently the lead plaintiff in several lawsuits to protect the right to asylum and has worked with the Berkeley City Council to reaffirm sanctuary. It is also working with a coalition on the state level to strengthen the state’s sanctuary law, which took effect in 2017.

Since the 1980s, what has remained constant in the sanctuary movement is the importance of the real-life stories of those who have fled violence and persecution.

“Many people don’t know this history. It’s critical for us to understand that the U.S. bears responsibility for contributing to the conditions that are causing people to flee,” Hoffman said. “It was the early activists who stood up for more just policies under the Reagan administration. What we do now influences generations to come.”

Like the 1980s, the current wave of migration is also fueled by U.S. policies in Central and South America, Artiga said. “Why are so many refugees coming from Venezuela?” he asked. “That’s a rich country.” Part of the reason many are fleeing, Artiga said, has to do with the U.S. oil embargo.

Local groups say they’re better prepared to protect immigrants

What is noticeably different between then and now is the level of fear ratcheted up by the Trump administration, affecting both churches and asylum seekers.

The ULC’s Falk worries that the government may actually try to do what the FBI would not do back in 1970: enter the church premises. So the chapel is in the process of creating a plan to train employees on how to interact with any kind of law enforcement on immigration matters.

“In 1982 when we did this the first time, the refugees were quite adamant about publicizing things,” Falk said. Now, many immigrants have shied away from the spotlight.

On Feb. 9, in his weekly letter to the St. Joseph’s congregation, Pastor John Prochaska acknowledged “the fear and anxiety that many immigrants and their families are feeling at this time.” He told Berkeleyside he heard a parishioner was afraid to go to the store. That sentiment was echoed after the Feb. 9 service, when two parishioners who worked as house cleaners said they were spending less time in public. The women also pointed out that attendance at the Spanish mass was down due to fear.

For some Berkeley immigrants, especially day laborers, staying home is not an option. They must brave the threat of deportation to earn a living, often working for less than the current minimum wage.

St. John’s Lynn said the immigrant community in general is panicking, which is President Trump’s strategy. “We’re just trying to hold the line.” If agents of the federal government start coming for the communities they help, “We’re not gonna let that happen,” he said.

Hoffman admits the ramped-up rhetoric has, understandably, sowed fear and confusion among immigrants. But, she believes community-based organizations are now in a stronger position to protect them if a federal raid happens. The groups have better networks and the support of local elected officials, who are also better prepared to protect immigrants.

“We are not in the same position we were during the first Trump administration,” she said. “We have a greater connection and also a deepened resolve to protect immigrant communities, who are our neighbors and friends and coworkers.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated the death of his former roommate.
To resolve the drug case, Mr Vedam pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge.
In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five-year sentence in the drug case, as part of a plea agreement.
On Wednesday, Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, told the BBC Mr Vedam had been convicted of drug trafficking.","Two different US courts have stayed the deportation of an Indian-origin man who spent more than 40 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.

Subramanyam ""Subu"" Vedam, 64, who was convicted of murdering his former roommate in 1983, was exonerated in October after new evidence surfaced in the case.

But immediately after his release from prison, he was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India.

Mr Vedam's family says that even though he was born in India, he moved to the US when he was nine months old. He is a legal permanent resident of the US and had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested.

He is currently being held at a short-term holding centre in Alexandria, Louisiana, that is equipped with an airstrip for deportations.

Last Thursday, an immigration judge stayed his deportation until the Board of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his conviction in a separate drug case. The same day, his lawyers got a stay on his deportation from a US District Court in Pennsylvania.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated the death of his former roommate. He was ultimately charged with murder and later convicted of the crime.

To resolve the drug case, Mr Vedam pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five-year sentence in the drug case, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence.

Wrongfully imprisoned for more than 40 years, US man now faces deportation to India

When ICE arrested Mr Vedam last month, they cited a 1988 deportation order and his conviction in the drug case as their reason for detaining him.

On Wednesday, Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, told the BBC Mr Vedam had been convicted of drug trafficking.

""Having a single conviction vacated will not stop ICE's enforcement of the federal immigration law,"" she said. ""If you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US.""

Mr Vedam's lawyers will now have to persuade an immigration court that the drug conviction should be outweighed by the years he wrongly spent in prison.

It could take several months before the Board of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his case.

Ava Benach, his immigration lawyer, told AP that she found his case ""truly extraordinary"".

""Forty-three years of wrongful imprisonment more than makes up for the possession with intent to distribute LSD when he was 20 years old,"" she told the news agency.

Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.

They have also stressed that Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best.

""We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,"" Ms Benach had said in an earlier statement to the BBC.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fb6e/live/c5991310-ba0d-11f0-9a0c-ffc5b386b15a.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:57:15.623139

President Trump, in a social media post, indicated on Tuesday that Republicans were going to challenge the results in court.","Hours after California voters approved a redistricting measure that would flip as many as five House seats for Democrats next year, California Republicans filed a lawsuit on Wednesday morning challenging the new maps.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, argues that the new maps are unconstitutional because they improperly use voters’ race as a factor in drawing districts and asks the court to block them from taking effect.

The lawsuit came the morning after California voters approved the redistricting measure, Proposition 50, which Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed to retaliate against gerrymandering that leaders in Texas and other Republican-led states approved at the request of President Trump.

It is not clear how successful the latest challenge will be. California Republicans were unsuccessful earlier this year at preventing the election through litigation, and Democrats have expressed confidence that their new maps would withstand legal scrutiny.

The Republican lawsuit challenging Proposition 50 is hardly isolated. Since July, there have been at least 15 redistricting cases filed, including six in Texas and two in North Carolina, said Kareem Crayton, a vice president with the Brennan Center for Justice, which has been tracking redistricting litigation.

In Missouri, for instance, four groups have filed lawsuits, contending that the state constitution prohibited mid-decade redistricting, among other reasons.

Mr. Newsom said during the campaign that he was confident that California’s new maps would pass legal muster.

The lawsuit did not come as a surprise. Opponents of Mr. Newsom’s plan had filed unsuccessful lawsuits in August in an attempt to keep the issue off the ballot, and later vowed to challenge the maps again if they were approved by voters.

President Trump, in a social media post, indicated on Tuesday that Republicans were going to challenge the results in court. Mr. Trump often discredits election results he does not like, and he said without evidence that the California ballot measure was rigged and that the mail-ballot system was under “very serious legal and criminal review.”

Mr. Newsom responded later that Mr. Trump’s post was a sign that he knew he was losing and that Californians needed to stand up to the president “and his authoritarianism.”

Against the backdrop of the new Republican lawsuit is a case before the Supreme Court that could limit a state’s ability to use race as a factor in drawing political maps. The case, Louisiana v. Callais, examines whether Louisiana lawmakers violated the Constitution by drawing a map that created two majority-Black congressional districts. A dozen white voters sued, arguing that the map was an illegal racial gerrymander that discriminated against them because of their race.

In arguments before the court last month, justices in the conservative majority appeared likely to rule for the plaintiffs and weaken a provision of the Voting Rights Act that has, for decades, allowed using race as a factor in drawing political maps to help minority voters elect the candidates of their choice.

The lawsuit filed on Wednesday accuses California of violating the Constitution “when it drew new congressional district lines based on race, specifically to favor Hispanic voters, without cause or evidence to justify it.” The lawsuit points to statements made by Democratic state lawmakers and a mapmaking consultant this year in which they referenced intentionally drawing some districts with a Latino majority.

Mark Meuser, an attorney for the plaintiffs challenging California’s map, said in September that the case before the Supreme Court could create a basis for challenging the maps that Democrats backed in California.

“These new lines are dovetailing very closely with what the Supreme Court is actually already hearing,” Mr. Meuser said during a presentation at the California Republican Party convention. “And as a result of that, I think they’re going to be very likely to enter a stay pending the outcome of this Louisiana case.”

California Republicans said on Wednesday that their lawsuit does not hinge on the Louisiana case, and that they are seeking a federal court injunction by December. They said that candidates need to know their district boundaries so they can file papers to run in the primary election.

An analysis by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that the maps approved under Proposition 50 have the same number of majority-minority districts as the prior set of congressional maps that was created by the state’s independent redistricting commission, which considered race, among various factors. Both plans created 16 majority-Latino districts, the analysis found.

If the Supreme Court strikes down the Voting Rights Act provision that has required drawing districts for voters of color where they can make up a majority, Democrats would have bigger problems nationwide, beyond California’s new maps or its old maps.

Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor at Harvard, said he thought it was unlikely the courts would stop California’s new maps from taking effect while the Supreme Court was weighing the Louisiana case.

“If there’s a properly adopted map and there’s some uncertainty over the law, typically the map will stay in effect, and it’s the plaintiffs’ case that will be deferred or delayed until there’s some resolution of the legal standard,” he said.

This legal framework would make returns of immigrants quicker but also more punitive, with longer detentions, stricter conditions, and the creation of “return hubs” in third countries.

But do these proposed measures reflect the views the people who implementing them – the police officers, judges, prosecutors and social workers? Our research shows that the new system is not only ineffective in achieving its aims, it also aggravates the situation for those affected, and violates their human rights.

The Commission’s rhetoric of ‘efficiency’

The European Commission’s main argument, as stated by its president Ursula von der Leyen, is that the current system is inefficient, with only 20% of deportation orders actually carried out.

However, the Commission’s view of efficiency is limited to a simple question of how many deportations are completed. This means it prioritises enforcement over protection and encourages forced returns, disregarding both human rights and alternative, more viable solutions.

Starting from this blinkered definition of “efficiency”, the EU’s response to “inefficiency” consists of toughening up the system through restrictive, punitive rules. These include:

Increasing the number of forced returns with a common European system

Expanding the use of detention

Establishing deportation zones in third countries.

However, a crucial component is missing. Before proposing legislation with such potential for social, economic and political impact, the European Commission has not presented concrete evidence based on research. It has not justified the urgency with which it wants to pass the legislation, nor has it quantified how effective its punitive and restrictive proposals will be in achieving their aims.

Read more: Europeans have more flexible views on how to respond to irregular migrants than policymakers think – new research

Stories from the ground

Our research comes at a key moment because it focuses on something that is absent from many policy-making debates: the perspectives and experiences of those who actually implement these policies – the police officers, judges, prosecutors and social workers.

Although the study was conducted in seven EU countries (Germany, Belgium, Slovenia, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Sweden) and the United Kingdom, the findings we present focus on Spain. They reveal why deportations and detentions are ineffective, even for those who carry them out.

In Spain, the percentage of completed expulsion orders is similar to the European average. Nevertheless, as the anti-immigrant far right gains further traction and traditional right-wing parties follow their lead, some parties are calling for more restrictive immigration controls that limit regularisation and prioritise the deportation of migrants.

But the story on the ground is very different. Our study reveals a deep frustration on the part of those who actually enforce migration policy. They are ignored by politicians who, neither in the debates nor in policies, account for the experiences and viewpoints of the people who work with migrants facing administrative irregularities:

“I think this could all be resolved by asking the people actually doing the work, but they’re never consulted. They’re never asked: ""Is this feasible? Can this be done?” (Police: ES-FG1-P4).

Among all border agents, our analysis revealed universal discontent with detention and deportation being the primary response to irregular migration, though the reasons differed between groups. Indeed, the interviews show that many of them do not see deportation as a tool of migration control, but as a punishment:

“Our work is not to deport foreigners. Our focus is on foreign criminals. Criminals. We don’t have any issue with foreigners” (Police: ES-FG1-P1).

The above view suggests that deportation be used primarily in penal cases, not as a general response to administrative irregularity. Even in exceptional cases, deportation is considered excessive because there is already a well-equipped penal system for dealing with crime. This raises the question of whether detention and deportation are ever proportional or necessary.

Lastly, agents emphasise that greater investment in detention and deportation measures will not solve structural problems. They consider the bureaucracy to be excessive, and highlight the contradictions between deportation and migrants’ rights, which are supposed to be guaranteed by both the state and international agreements:

“The way expulsions work is as if I had to do a job, but my hands are tied.” (Police: ES-FG1-P5).

Regularisation is the key

So what is the alternative to deportation? One answer, which is absent from the Commission’s proposal, would be to reduce deportation orders and create legal channels for people facing administrative irregularity.

Contrary to the dominant political rhetoric, border agents themselves see regularisation as the most effective way to confront irregularity. Some Spanish national police officers even acknowledge that irregularity is more a question of politics than policing:

“The problem we have here cannot be resolved. We have to regularise them, that’s the key” (Policía: ES-FG1-1).

In practice, agents prefer not to order deportation in response to irregularity. Our fieldwork with at-risk migrants confirms this dynamic: although they fear confrontation with the authorities, the fear of being deported is often outweighed by other uncertainties, such as unstable access to housing and employment.

Today, many people under deportation orders end up spending years of their lives in a legal limbo, with limited access to rights and services. Our research points to alternatives such as work and residence permits, which grant rights to people who have proven social, economic or family links to the country. In Spain this is known as “regularización por arraigo”, literally “regularisation by rooting”.

Far from being “a pull factor”, as conservative parties repeatedly say, these measures benefit general society as much as migrants – they reduce participation in the informal economy and strengthen social cohesion.

The evidence is clear: deporting, whether to countries of origin or third countries, is expensive, inefficient, and often incompatible with protecting human rights. The failure of deals such as EU-Turkey and Italy-Libya, as well as more recent pacts such as Italy-Albania and UK-Rwanda have proven this time and time again.

A judge we interviewed summarised the situtation succinctly:

“From a judicial perspective, and an approach rooted in human rights, […] deportation can only be materially justified in cases where serious or very serious crimes have been committed. Irregularity should not be handled through judicial channels. It should be done through regularisation policies and proper migratory policy, not by criminalising migration” (Judge: ES-IA-7).",https://images.theconversation.com/files/700077/original/file-20251009-56-lgk8cy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C120%2C3840%2C1920&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-05 10:57:38.027628

The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border.","The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents' aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation's third-largest city.

""I didn't have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it's far worse than I ever thought,"" Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since "" Operation Midway Blitz "" began in September as part of the Trump administration's push to target cities with "" sanctuary"" immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an ""invasion"" of ""criminal illegal aliens,"" how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

""We're what I call now sanctuary busters,"" he said. ""There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.""

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is ""far less lethal"" than what agents face.

""We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,"" he said. ""If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.""

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.""

""I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said in a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

""A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?"" he said. ""I'm proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.""

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Bovino's presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker ""wildly misinformed"" while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's ""publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.""

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

""We're going to be in Chicago a good while,"" he said. ""But you just never know.""

The final ruling follows multistate litigation and a preliminary injunction.

In issuing a permanent injunction, the Court found that the Trump Administration has “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions.

Japan previously suspended deportations for all applicants seeking refugee status recognition, including those appealing rejections of their requests.
One was a Middle Easterner who was applying for refugee status for the fifth time.
Support groups say the terms “illegal foreign residents” and “overstayers” are inappropriate because they include applicants for refugee status, who should be called “irregular migrants” or something else.
It said the plan most likely infringes on the human rights of foreign nationals who pose no threat whatsoever to the “safety and security” of Japanese citizens.","Officer-escorted deportations doubled year-on-year in the first three months of Japan’s Zero Illegal Foreign Residents Plan, the Immigration Services Agency said.

Between June and August, 119 individuals were forced out of Japan in this manner, compared with 58 in the corresponding period last year, the agency said Oct. 10.

Some of those deported were children who grew up in Japan. One parent was forced to leave his family behind in the country.

By nationality, Turks accounted for the most deportees, at 34, followed by 17 Sri Lankans, 14 Filipinos and 10 Chinese.

According to the agency’s stricter plan that started in late May, the government “aims for zero illegal foreign residents to realize an inclusive society where we can live together with foreign nationals in peace.”

Specifically, it set a goal of halving the number of “foreign nationals for whom deportation has been decided” by the end of 2030.

Japan previously suspended deportations for all applicants seeking refugee status recognition, including those appealing rejections of their requests.

However, an amendment to the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law, which took effect in June last year, said refugee status applicants can be deported if: (1) they are applying for the third or subsequent time without presenting “reasonable grounds” for recognition; and (2) they have been sentenced to at least three years of imprisonment without a stay of execution.

Thirty-six, or 30 percent of the 119 people deported in the three months, were applying for refugee recognition. Thirty-three of them fell in the first category and the other three in the second category.

One was a Middle Easterner who was applying for refugee status for the fifth time. Another was an East Asian who was sentenced to 20 years in prison on multiple charges, including robbery resulting in bodily injury, officials said.

The new deportation rules had been applied to only 25 individuals during a one-year period after the revised law came into force.

RECORD ENTRANT NUMBERS

In the first six months of this year, 19,728,400 people entered Japan, up an increase of more than 3 million from the half-year last year, the agency said. “Temporary visitors,” who include tourists, accounted for 98 percent of them.

The pace of new entrants is expected to lead to another record this year.

Around 71,200 foreign nationals remained in Japan beyond their authorized period of stay as of July 1, down about 3,600 from six months earlier.

By nationality, Vietnamese accounted for the most overstayers, at 13,100, followed by 10,900 Thais, 10,300 South Koreans and 6,300 Chinese.

Overall, overstayer numbers have dropped significantly from the peak of nearly 300,000 in the 1990s.

“Illegal foreign residents” is a broad concept that includes those who have smuggled themselves into Japan.

Support groups say the terms “illegal foreign residents” and “overstayers” are inappropriate because they include applicants for refugee status, who should be called “irregular migrants” or something else.

CHILDREN BORN, RAISED IN JAPAN

A number of ethnic Kurds in Japan with Turkish nationality have been deported since the zero plan started, including a father of a family in Saitama Prefecture in August.

The 41-year-old father, his wife and their three children arrived in Japan from Turkey in 2013.

The mother and the children gained residence status, but the father did not. He was applying for refugee recognition for the third time, saying he could face persecution in Turkey because he is a member of the Kurd minority.

The father was on “provisional release” from detention at an immigration control facility, and he had to appear at an immigration office every three months.

But he never returned home after reporting there in August. The family learned on the following day that he had been deported.

The mother and her children said they are now thinking about moving to Turkey.

Her youngest daughter, 7, however, was born in Japan, and her son, 15, and older daughter, 14, were both raised in Japan.

“I am worried if I could keep up with classes and make friends in Turkey,” the older daughter said.

A 17-year-old ethnic Kurd, who is a third-year senior high school student in Saitama Prefecture, said some family members of her friends and relatives have been deported. She said she fears it could be her family’s turn next.

Her family fled Turkey, where her father was politically active, and came to Japan when she was 5. Her family is applying for refugee status for the third time and could be deported at any moment.

She said she has few memories of her life in Turkey.

“How should I live in a country that I know little about?” she asked, adding that she wants to attend university and work in Japan.

CRITICISM BY RIGHTS GROUPS

A senior justice and immigration official said friction has arisen between ethnic Kurds and communities in Saitama Prefecture where they live in large numbers.

The official said the Immigration Services Agency hopes that promoting deportations will dispel the anxiety among the public.

However, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations criticized the zero plan in a president’s statement in May.

It said the plan most likely infringes on the human rights of foreign nationals who pose no threat whatsoever to the “safety and security” of Japanese citizens.

The group says the foreign nationals should instead be protected.

In addition, the zero plan “could lead to introducing a false perception that ‘the presence of irregular migrants causes the public safety to deteriorate’ and allowing it to take root in society,” the JFBA said.

The Japan Association for Refugees, a nonprofit organization, said in a written opinion in June that “the government has not been able to appropriately recognize those who should be recognized as refugees.”

It expressed concerns about “a further increase in deportations of refugees who need to be protected.”

Amnesty International Japan said in an open letter in July that the zero plan’s system is “premised on the elimination of foreign nationals and is likely to encourage discrimination.”

Attorney Kevin Herrera testified Tuesday that one of his clients ended up signing a voluntary deportation form after he was transferred from Broadview to a detention center in Indiana.","CHICAGO — A federal judge on Tuesday heard hours of testimony from undocumented immigrants who have recently been detained at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview — a place described as a “black box” in a lawsuit filed last week alleging horrific conditions and overcrowding.

After listening to five former detainees describe nights trying to sleep on plastic chairs or the cold concrete floor and days eating small rations of cold sandwiches and largely failing to get in touch with families or legal counsel, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman concluded the conditions were “unnecessarily cruel.”

“Sleeping shoulder to shoulder next to filthy toilets that are overflowing, surrounded by human waste,” the judge said. “It’s just unacceptable.”

Testimony from former detainees corroborated the broad strokes of what was alleged in the Oct. 30 complaint, including that those held in Broadview were denied extra food and water beyond two to three bottles of water and a cold sandwich per day. And both they and a pair of immigration attorneys described how it was difficult, if not impossible, to communicate with anyone on the other side of the facility’s walls.

Without being able to access legal counsel, the lawsuit alleges detainees are coerced into signing voluntary deportation papers, sometimes without truly understanding what they’re agreeing to.

Testifying via videoconference from Honduras, Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara briefly recounted her arrest by federal immigration agents early in the morning on Oct. 2 while she was on her way to work. She then spent five days in Broadview, where she and other detainees used a garbage bag to unclog an overflowing toilet and was — like everyone else who testified — never given a toothbrush, toothpaste or even soap.

“They wouldn’t give us anything that had to do with cleaning,” Pereira Guevara said through a Spanish interpreter, recalling that she and the other women in the holding cell were also denied a broom to clean or tidy up. “Absolutely nothing.""

Voluntary departure forms

Attorneys for the detainees allege ICE has gone from ignoring its own minimum standards for processing facilities like Broadview to using the filthy environment as leverage to pressure those held inside into signing voluntary departure forms.

Pereira Guevara testified she was led to believe that “if I didn’t sign, I was going to be held there until I signed.” And when she asked to speak with a lawyer, immigration agents allegedly told her, “Well what for?” as Pereira Guevara was already facing a deportation order she wasn’t aware of until after her arrest last month. She testified she’d come to the U.S. five years ago.

Eventually, Pereira Guevara signed the voluntary departure form. She said she was told she’d be allowed back in the U.S. after five years — a length of separation she hoped wouldn’t be too hard on her 5-year-old daughter and 9-month-old son, who are now living with her brother in Joliet. But once she was back in Honduras after a stop at a detention center in Louisiana, Pereira Guevara found out that promise wasn’t true.

Positioning the phone camera away from her face as she wiped away tears, Pereira Guevara said she didn’t know when she’d see her children again.

“My children, who are so young,” she said, crying. “I really don’t know.”

Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, a 56-year-old Mexican national who has been in the U.S. for 35 years, said he also presented with voluntary deportation documents while he was in Broadview after his Oct. 29 arrest, grew emotional when recounting what he told the agents.

“They said, ‘Why don’t you want to go?’” he testified through an interpreter. “And I said, ‘Well, I have my family here.’”

Moreno Gonzalez is married with two children, ages 31 and 21, both of whom are U.S. citizens. He was arrested in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood last Wednesday morning while he said he was waiting on his boss to begin a construction job.

“I don’t have anyone in Mexico,” he said. “I have my son and daughter here. And I don’t want to leave. I don’t want to go back to my country. I don’t want to leave.”

Felipe Agustin Zamacona claimed Tuesday that an immigration agent in Broadview tried to trick him into signing voluntary deportation papers by saying they were “court papers” after Zamacona told him he “wanted to go in front of a judge.”

Zamacona, who testified in English and completed high school and some college in Chicago, said he could read what the forms actually said: “self-deportation.”

“And you had no intention of signing those papers?” Alexa Van Brunt, an attorney with the MacArthur Justice Center asked.

“No,” he said.

“Why not?” the lawyer asked.

“My whole life is here,” Zamcona said, adding that he intends to fight his deportation proceedings.

The 47-year-old is Moreno Gonzalez’s co-plaintiff in the lawsuit. After the round trip to a Missouri detention center and back over the weekend, both men are currently being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago.

Attorney Kevin Herrera testified Tuesday that one of his clients ended up signing a voluntary deportation form after he was transferred from Broadview to a detention center in Indiana. He blamed ICE for not allowing him to speak with the client while he was in Broadview, and for having an unreliable online locator that didn’t accurately show his client’s transfer.

Herrera believed he’d be able to clear up his client’s arrest because he was already handling his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals case, so after he was told the client was arrested, Herrera marched up to the Broadview facility carrying his client’s DACA extension letter, a copy of his social security card and his work permit.

But after navigating several Illinois state troopers and federal agents, he was ultimately denied the opportunity to speak with his client. Phone and email communications were also unsuccessful until after the client had signed the form in the Indiana detention center.

“I was not able to counsel him not to sign documents and I believe that’s why he ended up in the situation that he’s in,” Herrera said.

Temporary restraining order

The Broadview facility is only meant to hold arrestees for a maximum of 12 hours before they’re moved to the next part of the immigration adjudication process. Though there are two showers in the building, neither of them are functional. There is no kitchen on site.

But in concluding Tuesday’s hearing, Gettleman said that due to the increased level of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, it was clear the Department of Homeland Security is no longer using the facility as it was intended, as the detention rooms are crowded to the breaking point and detainees stay well beyond 12 hours.

“It’s really become a prison,” the judge said, noting that conditions that could be accepted for short stints should be viewed through a different lens when people are held for days on end.

Gettleman said plaintiffs had definitely made a case for a temporary restraining order but he needed time to think about how to make it “as narrow as possible.” He said he intended to issue the order late Wednesday afternoon.

The Trump administration argued that a temporary restraining order resembling anything like what the plaintiffs requested would “effectively shut down operations at Broadview.” And because there are no other facilities in Illinois that can house detainees, a temporary restraining order would also hurt the administration’s ability to enforce immigration laws writ large.

Illinois is one of only two states that ban local law enforcement from detaining people solely on the basis of their immigration status. Though recent reporting from WTTW-TV indicates a number of law enforcement agencies across the state were still housing some ICE detainees, a 2021 law required existing contracts between ICE and local law enforcement be voided. In 2022, the law shuttered the two largest de facto detention centers in the Chicago region: McHenry and Kankakee counties.

“A TRO would effectively halt the government’s ability to enforce immigration laws in Illinois,” Department of Justice attorney Jana Brady said Tuesday. “The government has a right to enforce immigration laws. Whether it’s a popular belief, they do have the ability to do it. And they’re doing their jobs.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-11/251009-protestors-back-aa-1.jpg?h=0caf38e4&itok=FsFiZiC5,N,,2025-11-05 09:57:56.232406

Pace was unable to confirm the identity of the man taken by the masked agents, though a deputy told him the Acura was registered to a Palatine address.","Armed, masked federal immigration agents detained one man and chased another through a residential neighborhood in unincorporated Northbrook on Monday, according to witnesses.

The incidents, which were captured in photos and videos taken by neighborhood residents and viewed by the Tribune, took place on quiet streets early in the morning, feet from school-aged children waiting for the bus.

“There were kids a couple houses down waiting for the bus stop,” said Tea Shehedeh of the neighborhood, called Glenbrook Countryside. She witnessed the events.

People in the area posted in Glenbrook Countryside’s neighborhood Facebook group about Monday’s events. The masked men drove unmarked vehicles and do not appear to have spoken to residents or identified themselves as law enforcement, but the local police agency—the Cook County Sheriff’s office — later received word from the son of the detained man that the incident had been a Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement maneuver.

Glenbrook Countryside is a small neighborhood in Northfield Township, nestled between the Northbrook Court shopping center and the Somme Woods, south of Lake Cook Road.

Shehedeh was driving her kids to school around 7:55 a.m. Monday when she watched a trio of dark-colored vehicles overtake and “box in” a black Acura sedan headed south on Cottonwood Road, near its intersection with Beechnut Road.

She says the pursuing cars drove well over the posted 20-mile-per-hour speed limit on Cottonwood, and one car drove “erratically” as it overtook and cut off the Acura.

Shehedeh said she saw armed masked men exit the unmarked cars and approach the driver’s side window of the Acura. She was “waved on” by one of the masked agents and did not witness the driver of the Acura, who she said appeared to be of Mexican descent, exit the vehicle.

“I was kind of frantic because I had a friend on Friday be assaulted by an ICE agent in Skokie,” she said. “Seeing them face-to-face, I was like, ‘oh my God.’”

Cook County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Matthew Walberg said the son of the detained man told sheriff’s deputies later that morning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had called him to say they had taken his father into custody.

ICE does not communicate with the sheriff’s office about their enforcement operations, Walberg said. Illinois law enforcement agencies are barred from collaborating with federal agents for civil immigration enforcement under the TRUST Act.

A resident who asked to be identified only Michelle K. for privacy reasons, who lives immediately south of Cottonwood and Beechnut, said her daughter and their neighbor were waiting for the bus on Michelle K.’s front lawn when the agents arrived.

She watched a man, who she said appeared to be Hispanic, be taken from the Acura by the masked captors and placed into one of the unmarked cars without incident; his identity remains unknown as of Tuesday.

“It happened really quickly,” she said.

She shared videos with the Tribune of two masked men wearing bulletproof vests standing next to a blue SUV in front of her house, with the Acura parked up the street. Neither man appears to display insignia identifying them as police or federal authorities on their vests.

A yellow school bus can be seen driving past in one video; neighborhood residents who spoke to the Tribune said that bus would have been transporting elementary school students to Westmoor School in Northbrook, part of Northbrook School District 28.

The story did not end with the taking of the Acura driver. The blue SUV driven by the captors appeared to depart, Michelle K. said, but minutes later, someone in a black BMW sedan arrived, possibly to pick up the abandoned Acura, and the blue SUV quickly reappeared.

Another video recorded by Michelle K. shows the black BMW’s driver interacting briefly with a masked agent before returning to the BMW and driving off at high speed south on Cottonwood, with the blue SUV following.

Michelle K. said a Cook County sheriff’s deputy later told her the masked agents were likely staking out the Acura in order to detain whoever came to pick it up. Because the Glenbrook Countryside neighborhood is in an unincorporated area, Cook County sheriffs serve as its police force.

“It’s exactly what you’ve seen reposted everywhere,” she said. “It’s just weird to see it in your front yard on a Monday.”

Sheriff’s deputies arrived on scene around 8:17 a.m., according to a police report, where they met with the son of the detained man when he arrived to pick up the abandoned Acura.

Walberg said the sheriff’s office had no additional information about the ICE agents’ pursuit of the BMW driver.

As of midday Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had not responded to the Tribune’s request to confirm whether DHS, Border Patrol or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were active in unincorporated Northbrook on Monday.

Northfield Township trustee and Glenbrook Countryside resident Vincent Pace said he arrived on-scene at 8:05 a.m., shortly after the masked agents departed, and spoke with sheriff’s deputies when they arrived shortly thereafter.

He also spoke with two people who said they knew the detainee and who arrived around 9:30 a.m. to pick up the Acura. Pace was unable to confirm the identity of the man taken by the masked agents, though a deputy told him the Acura was registered to a Palatine address.

“As a resident, I’m of course extremely unhappy to have armed, unidentified, masked men speeding around the neighborhood and doing aggressive boxing-in maneuvers, especially at precisely the time when children are going to school,” Pace wrote in a text message.

“As a trustee, I question the point of this policy of aggressiveness. The previous administration deported many more than Trump’s first administration, and all without masked, armed men in front of our children’s school buses. Safe to say doing it like this isn’t just about enforcing immigration law.”

Northbrook School District 28 did not respond to a Tuesday morning request for comment.

Some neighborhood residents expressed shock that the federal government’s immigration crackdown appeared to have come to their community.

Residents of Glenbrook Countryside described it to the Tribune as quiet, upper-middle-class – and predominantly white. A small number of Eastern European emigres have inhabited the community for years.

“I thought of it as just live and let live, and nobody gets in trouble,” said Sandra Gran, 77, who’s lived on Cottonwood Road for 31 years.

Ben, a Cottonwood Road resident who declined to give his last name, said the neighborhood rarely saw law enforcement activity, except to police speeding drivers.

“Once in a while the sheriff’s office drives through to see we don’t get any cut-throughs,” he said, referring to the use of the neighborhood as a shortcut to avoid the intersection of Lake Cook Road and South Waukegan Road.

Road signs on either side of Cottonwood Road notify drivers of the 20-mile-per-hour speed limit, with bright yellow SLOW – CHILDREN signs posted beneath.

The judge then agreed Tuesday that a case had been made for a temporary restraining order governing conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. It’s become the focal point of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign here.

In fact, the facility has become so central to “Operation Midway Blitz” that a Justice Department lawyer warned such an order could shut the whole thing down.

The commentary came during a hearing at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, prompted by a proposed class-action lawsuit brought last week by the MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU. It alleges that “Broadview is a black hole, and federal officials are acting with impunity inside its walls.”

Gettleman put off a final ruling until Wednesday afternoon. He said he doesn’t plan to “fashion an order that is impossible to comply with.” But he also said he’d been presented with a “disturbing record” Tuesday that cleared the bar for court intervention.

“I think everybody can admit that we don’t want to treat people the way that I heard people are being treated today,” the judge said.

Five former detainees described unsanitary conditions inside the Broadview facility. One broke down on the stand, telling the judge “it was too much, it was too much.” One said he had to step over bodies at night while people slept on the floor. Another said he’d have to wake people up to go to the bathroom at night, because they were sleeping beside the toilet.

Justice Department lawyer Jana Brady challenged their memories and understanding of events inside the facility. She argued in a recent court filing that people there are “adequately provided with food, clothing, shelter, and medical care before they are transferred to another detention facility.”

But Tuesday’s testimony was otherwise met with a tepid response. Rather than take it on directly, Brady argued that a temporary restraining order could actually cripple the Trump administration’s immigration campaign, given how central the Broadview facility is to that mission.

“Granting this [temporary restraining order], as it’s proposed currently, would effectively halt the government’s ability to enforce immigration laws in Illinois,” she said.

Gettleman assured lawyers near the end of the day that he doesn’t intend to do anything that will “interfere with the executive’s decision to increase the enforcement of the immigration laws.”

But the judge also warned early in the day that, “if the conditions are unconstitutional, so be it.”

Chicago’s federal courthouse has been the site of several pivotal hearings in recent weeks, as lawyers push back against the Trump administration deportation campaign. Judges there have sided against the White House when it comes to National Guard deployment and the treatment of protesters and journalists.

Now the focus is on the detention facility that’s been the site of near-daily protests ever since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Government lawyers have recently said the Broadview facility is “not equipped to be an overnight facility.” But the Sun-Times and WBEZ have since documented how it has been holding people for multiple days at a time.

And the lawsuit before Gettleman alleges the feds “are now warehousing people at Broadview for days on end.”

Lawyers claim “the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable. Most nights are freezing cold, yet only some receive a thin foil blanket, sweater, or sweatpants to try to retain warmth.”

“The physical conditions are filthy,” the lawyers allege in the lawsuit, “with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor.”

They called it a “breeding ground for illness to spread,” and added that “privacy is non-existent.”

Pablo Moreno Gonzalez told the judge he was detained there last week from Wednesday until Friday. He described being held in a cell with as many as 150 men, where people were gathered inches away from the toilet and “you can’t go because everybody’s seeing you.”

Felipe Agustin Zamacona, arrested last Thursday in Wheeling, said he had to wake someone up because they were sleeping beside the toilet and he had to use it. And Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara testified through a remote link from Honduras that she and other female detainees had to use garbage bags to unclog a toilet at one point.

“One day we asked for a broom so that we, ourselves, could clean,” she said. “And they refused.”

Gonzalez and Zamacona are still in federal custody. Guevara has been deported.

Lawyer Shelby Vcelka testified about trying to get a breast pump and nipple cream to a nursing mother of a “4-month-old U.S. citizen child” while the mother was being held at the Broadview facility. Vcelka said she was eventually allowed to walk up to its front door to pass them on.

But she never actually heard from the woman while she was detained in Broadview. The client was eventually deported. And Vcelka said she later learned that the woman never received the items Vcelka delivered.

Ruben Torres Maldonado, whose arrest recently made headlines because his 16-year-old daughter is battling cancer, also took the stand in Gettleman’s courtroom after an immigration judge ordered his release last week.

Maldonado said he found a seat while being held for multiple days at the Broadview facility where he could sleep but others had to rest on the floor.

“It was full at night,” Maldonado said.

The facility, he said, “smelled like excrement.”

“In the morning they would give us this bottle of water and this piece of Subway sandwich with one lettuce and one slice of ham,” he said. “And for lunch it was the same thing. And for dinner it was the same thing.”

But, he said, there was one benefit provided to detainees if they agreed to sign off on their own deportation.

Maldonado told the judge, “they would leave earlier.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/036483b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F17%2F63%2F7576872a4b9386d1a5b785ded77f%2Fbroadview-092325-5.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:03:05.809051

Gonzales spent the next two months at a Tacoma, Washington detention facility — an experience that his attorney, Abby Sullivan Engen, said left him traumatized.

Gonzales — a pseudonym — is a speaker of an indigenous Mayan language, and struggles with a hearing problem. Within the facility, ICE failed to provide an interpreter to explain legal documents or other procedures, leaving him isolated and unsure of what was happening. Gonzales may be legally deaf, according to his attorney.

Before Gonzales was arrested and Sullivan Engen learned of his case through the rapid response hotline, his family had hired a private attorney. That attorney also ignored Gonzales’s specialized needs, conducted the consultation in Spanish, and filed his asylum application in Spanish, although Gonzales’ understanding is limited in that language. As a result, the private attorney failed to capture critical details about Gonzales’s asylum claim as an indigenous person fleeing his home country. “[The claim] doesn’t tell the most important aspects of his story,” said Sullivan Engen, co-director of the immigrants’ rights practice at La Raza Legal Center in Oakland.

Gonzales’s case, though harrowing, is not unique. Translating across language and culture has always been complicated — especially in asylum cases. Sullivan Engen said that language access in legal proceedings is a “huge concern” that must be addressed. But as the Trump administration has escalated threats against immigrants, access to interpretation and translation services has become even harder to secure within detention centers, and throughout the legal process.

On Oct. 28, Gonzales was released from detention after the success of the habeas petition that Sullivan Engen filed on his behalf. While his release is a victory, Gonzales must now grapple with the trauma of his detention while continuing his asylum proceedings with a “terrible asylum application that will follow him,” said Sullivan Engen.

For cases like these, the stakes are high. When an asylum seeker “cannot express themselves fully, it can result in the loss of their asylum case,” said Sullivan Engen.

Non-profits respond to a language-access crisis under Trump

In February, Trump terminated a 2023 Biden-era directive that required immigration judges and local Homeland Security officials to connect immigrants with resources like out-of-court translation services to help them fill out and file asylum-related documents. San Francisco immigration judges still offer asylum-seekers the same list of resources as they did before February — but now with a warning that, most likely, every organization on the list is too busy to take on any new cases. In March, Trump revoked Executive Order 13166, a Clinton-era order that required all federal agencies to provide meaningful language access for people with limited English proficiency.

Despite these rollbacks, immigration courts still have interpreters—in San Francisco, often through in-person SOSi contractors or the remote Lionsbridge service— but there’s less federal funding for interpretation and translation services overall. Furthermore, courts now operate without the guidance they once received from the Executive Office for Immigration Review on how to provide the kind of interpretation that asylum-seekers actually need.

The responsibility to fill in the gaps has fallen on local immigration non-profits and pro-bono interpreters — just as they are facing unprecedented caseloads and budget cuts. Immigration attorneys in the Bay Area often provide in-house translation services to clients— but those who take pro bono cases now have waitlists of six months or more.

“We don’t have the luxury of a waitlist,” said Ariel Koren, who runs Respond Crisis Translation, a non-profit that provides free translation and interpreters for a variety of situations, including asylum cases. Due to the language-access crisis at hand, people frequently contact the organization only moments before their asylum interviews, Koren said.

Miscommunication starts at the border

The problem of interpretation starts at the border, said Sarah Gavigan, a senior immigration attorney for CARACEN S.F., a nonprofit that is part of San Francisco’s Language Access Network, a coalition of non-profits that advocates for access to interpreters and other translation services in city government.

When a person arrives at the U.S. border to seek asylum, if they aren’t able to make themselves understood to the border agents they encounter, they are deported immediately — and that deportation makes it much harder for them to seek asylum in the future.

Even after Trump’s executive orders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is supposed to provide migrants with basic interpretation services after they have been detained at the border. But, said Gavigan, this rarely happens, and didn’t happen even under prior administrations.

When someone claims asylum, CBP gives them a Form M-444 to sign stating that they have been made aware of their upcoming asylum interview, and tells them they have the right to an interpreter they feel comfortable communicating with. Gavigan, who works with unaccompanied minors, has yet to encounter one who has received a Form M-444 in their own language, she said. The forms she’s seen are always in English.

Asylum seekers often rely on interpreters at every stage of the process: from finding free or low-cost legal help to understanding court notices, logistics and the government’s requirements inside and outside the courtroom. Without this support, Gavigan has seen people deported who didn’t even realize they were in proceedings that could end in removal.

Asylum case data analyzed by Syracuse University’s TRAC project found that asylum-seekers with legal representation fare better in court. The Northern California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice found that immigrants are 10.5 times more likely to succeed with representation.

TRAC specifically found that those who spoke less common languages are less likely to have attorneys. For example, Mandarin-speaking asylum-seekers had an attorney 79 percent of the time; speakers of Kekchi only had a lawyer 39 percent of the time.

A study published in the Denver Law Review in 2020 found significant ramifications from the lack of access to interpreters in the asylum process: Longer wait times in detention centers, mistranslated interviews leading to case dismissals, or detentions.

In recent years, San Francisco’s pool of migrants has become even more linguistically diverse, said Jose Ng, who co-leads the Language Access Network. He’s now seeing more requests for interpreters who speak Kazakh and Turkmen, for example, two languages he rarely used to see demand for.

Those who can afford it pay about $20 to $50 a page to certified translation services to translate documents, and about $250 an hour to interpreters for in-person meetings. Those who cannot afford such fees take their chances at submitting documents solely in their native language, which can lead to a case delay or dismissal.

The Bay Area interpreters at the frontlines

Crecencio Ramirez is an interpreter fluent in Mam, a language with 23 recognized dialects spoken by indigenous people in Guatemala and Mexico. He juggles a packed work schedule: Ramirez works for three Bay Area immigration non-profits and runs Radio Ba’lam in Oakland, the only Bay Area radio station dedicated to serving the Mam community. There are an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Mam speakers in Oakland, and the number of Mam asylum-seekers continues to rise.

Many of the Mam speakers who find Ramirez have received a “Notice to Appear” from Homeland Security indicating that they have to appear in court, or face automatic deportation. These notices, Ramirez said, are always written in English.

Ramirez has seen cases, he said, where Mam speakers “couldn’t read the NTA so they shucked it off to collect dust.” He has seen other people miss their hearings because they couldn’t find someone to translate for them quickly enough.

In her rapid response work, Koren said that one of the “most common issues” is asylum-seekers showing up to their merit interviews without an interpreter, because they did not understand the legal process that had been presented only in English.

Unlike court hearings ordered by a Notice to Appear, a merit interview is part of the affirmative asylum pathway conducted by the USCIS. This interview is the final point for an asylum seeker to present their case in front of a USCIS officer, but it does not provide an interpreter for the session. The availability and quality of interpretation is “make or break,” said Koren.

Professional interpreters in San Francisco can charge around $1,000 for an hour-long merit interview, but many interviews extend past three hours, said Koren, and so many asylum-seekers bring a family or community member to avoid the cost.

One man’s asylum case saved by a last-minute language intervention

On a recent Thursday night, Felipe shared the story of his asylum case at a panel event hosted by Respond Crisis Translation.

In 2022, he fled from Colombia to the Bay Area due to mounting threats of violence against him because of his work as a farmworker activist. He was placed in the affirmative asylum process by CBP, but ran into trouble when attempting to understand the process in San Francisco.

He clicked on the USCIS page, where he read about the asylum interview in English, but lost critical details due to the language barrier. As a result, “I showed up to the interview without an interpreter,” he said. The interview was rescheduled, and Felipe found a community member who committed to translating for him.

But, when the day came, the person canceled an hour and a half before the interview.

Felipe said the USCIS officer told him the interview would be canceled entirely if he could not find a substitute interpreter to show up within 15 minutes. “I was blessed with good luck,” Felipe said, when he ran into Sullivan Engen. She quickly connected him with Koren, who successfully interpreted the interview. He later received asylum.

But others have not had the same good fortune.

Attorney Wahida Noorzad, an Afghani lawyer based in Concord, said that some of her clients who have been able to afford an interpreter have still not had luck. In one case, her client had an interpreter who spoke in their language — Pashtun — but in a different dialect. In this case, Noorzad quickly identified active mistranslations and began waving to grab the attention of the USCIS officer who asked, “Why are you jumping?” Noorzad replied, “You’re getting the wrong answers.”

One asylum-seeker’s attempt to receive in-language legal aid services

On a recent morning inside his courtroom at 630 Sansome St., Judge Joseph Park shook his head in frustration and said loudly, for the second time, “Kazakh!”

“Sorry?” replied the operator for Lionsbridge, the remote translation and interpretation service that contracts with the court.

Park redialed the line once more, in hopes of a better connection. In the courtroom, a 41-year-old man from Kazakhstan waited nervously. In the front bench, his wife sat with their two young children.

“I’m afraid that I have no interpreters in that language,” the operator replied.

Judge Park asked the man if he felt comfortable conducting his proceedings in Russian, the man’s second language. “I have command over both languages,” the man replied, and the hearing proceeded with a Russian interpreter on the line.

Mission Local later spoke over the phone with the Kazakh asylum-seeker with the help of a Russian interpreter.

By law, the man must file any documents in his case with a translator who is certified for the job. Since his court date, he said, he had searched in vain for a Kazakh speaker who could help him through the process — ultimately, he would settle for a Russian translator, against the general advice of asylum attorneys. “I looked on Google, on Facebook, on many social networks and I didn’t find a Kazakh translator anywhere.” He paused. “Maybe out of a thousand, one will be found somewhere.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9997-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 08:18:29.859885

By ABHINAYA KASAGANI — akasagani@ucdavis.edu

America’s reluctance to admit immigrants into the country stems from their reluctance to acknowledge that their economy has been dependent on immigrant labor for decades. While there has been a recent influx of several half-baked and outdated ideas about how the immigration crisis should be resolved, or whether there’s even a crisis to be resolved to begin with, one fact remains true: America’s economy relies on the contributions of immigrants.

Our economy has, for decades now, remained dependent on immigrant workers — whether in the agricultural sector, construction, healthcare or technology — and yet we, as a nation, refuse to acknowledge how much we depend on this very work. Instead, we hide behind a reluctance to welcome or even acknowledge immigrants, concealing how essential they really are.

While some claim that Donald Trump is playing a game of four-dimensional chess that is beyond the comprehension of the ordinary person, others recognize this lack of dimension and substance for what it is — “the land of the free” once again choosing to be heavily self-congratulatory despite having done nothing to earn that praise. The National Immigration Law Center notes that anti-immigrant policies — in what is ironically referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) — cut “health care, nutrition and tax benefits while expanding detention and enforcement” in an attempt to position immigration as a threat, rather than a resource.

53.3 million immigrants lived in the United States in January 2025 — the largest number ever recorded. However, “in the ensuing months, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived,” according to the Pew Research Center.

While politicians continue to make grandiose claims about securing the border and protecting American jobs, they fail to note the irony of the matter: Very few Americans want the jobs that immigrants are willing to take. Entitled Americans remain resistant to jobs they deem undesirable, resorting to the creation of unfounded claims that immigrant policies allow for job theft.

Out of the roughly 2.6 million people working in the agricultural sector, 1 million workers are primarily noncitizen immigrants. On top of this, roughly 3.3 million immigrants of the total immigrant population work in the construction industry, often underpaid and underprotected. Millions of immigrants also operate within white-collar industries and professional jobs in the tech sector or as business professionals, educators and health services professionals. The American Immigration Council, through new data analysis, confirms the extent to which immigrants are contributing billions of dollars to the U.S. economy.

Despite this dependence, national discourse attempts to claim full ownership of the country’s successes and attribute partial responsibility for their failures to immigrants. The reluctance to admit that the U.S. is dependent on immigrant labor — in an attempt to strengthen their political posturing as a self-sufficient nation — is cause for concern. The social exclusion of immigrants allows the federal government to ensure it profits off of cheap workers, while simultaneously refusing to integrate immigrants into its national identity. Millions of immigrant families live in fear of deportation, poor working conditions, deprivation of basic human rights and lack of access to healthcare and education. To this day, no concrete solutions are being considered on the matter.

The U.S., for whom democracy claims to be built on “liberty and justice for all,” seemingly handpicks who it decides is deserving; excluding the rest by refusing them any extension of justice. This reluctance hasn’t grown overnight, and the country’s persistence is interesting to note — the image of a “self-made” nation, years later, still depends on an invisible collective force that makes individual success possible.

“Go back to where you came from, but please don’t go too far — we need you;” this, as a sentiment, can’t sustain a developed nation built on the labor of others. Only when America stops pretending that immigrants aren’t its backbone, or that they rely on them in order to survive, can they truly deliver on the promise of freedom and fairness they have always stood for. Otherwise, we will be left debating whether or not there is a crisis to be resolved when millions of livelihoods are at stake.

""In general, the court is very reluctant to second guess presidential determinations that something implicates national security or that there is an exigency,"" he says.","The Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a consequential case with potentially profound economic consequences for the country and the presidency: The issue is tariffs.

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, President Trump proclaimed what he called ""liberation day,"" a day that ""will be remembered as the day American industry was reborn.""

Oral arguments in the case are set for 10 a.m. ET. Listen here:

Carrying out his campaign pledge to impose massive tariffs on foreign imports, Trump issued an executive order that initially imposed a tariff of at least 10% on goods from most countries doing business with the United States. Goods from countries like China have been hit with much higher tariffs — up to 145%, though they have since come down. Imports from allies like Canada and Mexico have been taxed at 25%; Canada's rate was later increased to 35%. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes this week, Trump credited the tariffs with the deal he just negotiated with China, boasting that without tariffs, China would not have ""come to the table.""

The case before the court

But the up and down, fluctuating tariffs around the world spooked American businesses, prompting a court challenge, contending that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs.

In some two dozen previous cases, the Supreme Court has been largely receptive to Trump's claims of presidential authority, but those victories came on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, allowing Trump policies to take effect on a temporary basis while the litigation played out in the lower courts.

In contrast, the tariff cases are the real deal, with the court having ordered full briefing and expedited arguments in the case, and offering the justices the first real opportunity to say ""no"" to the president.

One of the lead challengers to the tariffs is Victor Owen Schwartz, a wine and spirits importer from upstate New York who has been in business for 40 years.

""The thing is there's such a misconception out there that foreign entities are paying the tariffs,"" he says, adding: ""I can't say this enough times: Americans are paying the taxes. American business is paying the taxes and it will be passed on to consumers.""

According to Schwartz, small businesses not only have to worry about fluctuating tariff rates, but the tariffs have also plunged the value of the dollar compared to the euro. When you add up all of these costs, he says, they amount to about 35% more he has to pay for his wines. So, he charges more, eats part of the tariff, and is down to a barebones profit that in the long run, he says, is ""unsustainable.""

Or as Schwartz wryly puts it: ""Do you think I can increase the price of Sancerre by 35%?""

Trump's view

Countering that argument is Trump who sees tariffs as potentially bringing in trillions of dollars to the federal government. They've brought in $195 billion this fiscal year, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

""I always say 'tariffs' is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,"" Trump has said, ""because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our country's businesses back that left us.""

Indeed, the tariffs are so important to the president that he flirted with the idea of attending Wednesday's argument. In the end, he decided against being the first president to do that, instead sending his treasury secretary.

Regardless of who is in the court chamber on Wednesday though, the justices certainly know that a ruling against Trump would be a dramatic, even embarrassing, setback for the president, and none of the six conservatives, including three Trump appointees, is likely looking for a confrontation with the nation's chief executive.

The issue the justices must resolve is whether Trump has the power to unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA. Lower courts have ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under both the statute and the Constitution.

But the president argues that both allow him to impose tariffs in order to deal with persistent trade imbalances and to stem the flood of fentanyl coming into the United States. Both, he asserts, present national emergencies and pose a threat to national security.

As Solicitor General D. John Sauer put it in the administration's briefs, were the Supreme Court to invalidate the tariffs, it ""would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy."" And he said, that were the court to rule against the president, it would ""lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.""

While the administration conceded in the lower courts that this is the first time in the 50-year history of IEEPA that any president has tried to use the statute to impose tariffs on his own, it continues to maintain that the Trump tariffs are beyond the jurisdiction of the courts altogether, and that the only check on presidentially imposed tariffs would be if Congress were to specifically reject them.

Arguments against tariffs

Countering that argument at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, lawyer Neal Katyal will tell the justices that the word ""tariff"" isn't even in the IEEPA statute and that there is ""zero"" authority under the statute to justify such sweeping presidential authority when the constitution itself gives the legislature, not the president, the power to tax.

""The idea that every president had this power all along—Presidents Reagan to Obama— and none of them knew it and all of them have been spending all this time negotiating with Congress to try and get tariff authority when they had it from the start, is just too fanciful to believe,"" Katyal asserts.

He notes that Congress has created ""an extensive trade architecture"" governing everything from how a president may deal with trade deficits to national security questions. For instance, a different statute does allow the president to increase tariffs by 15% when there is a serious trade deficit, but only for 150 days.

""The president has said, 'I can blow past all of those things and do whatever I want,'"" says Katyal. And that, he maintains, is contrary to the nation's history dating from its founding.

""That is why we had the Boston Tea Party. It is why our Revolutionary War was fought. The idea that you can tax Americans through the monarch's decision alone is as foreign to our Constitution and our traditions as anything I have ever seen.""

IEEPA wasn't aimed at tariffs or taxes at at all, says Katyal's co-counsel Michael McConnell, a conservative former federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, who now is director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center. ""It's a statute about imposing various forms of sanctions, economic sanctions on countries with whom we are in conflict,"" he says, adding, ""It has nothing to do with imposing taxes on Americans for engaging in perfectly lawful trade with friendly nations.""

One of the issues raised by the challengers is that the administration's argument also fails under the so-called ""major questions doctrine,"" first enunciated by the court's conservatives in 2022. It says that for Congress to delegate a major policy decision to another branch of government, it must be explicit in its text about doing so. But at least one member of the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has indicated that in his view at least the major questions doctrine does not apply to foreign affairs and national security.

The briefs filed by interested groups in Wednesday's case are remarkably lopsided, with 38 briefs supporting the challengers, representing over a thousand organizations and individuals on the right, left, and center of the political spectrum. Also among those supporting the challengers are a large group of national security experts from previous Republican and Democratic administrations and a similarly diverse set of 44 economists on both the left and right, including four Nobel prize winners.

On the other side are six briefs, mainly representing individuals, who did not want to be interviewed for this story.

That said, the case is not a slam dunk at all, says conservative scholar Jonathan Adler, of William and Mary Law School.

""In general, the court is very reluctant to second guess presidential determinations that something implicates national security or that there is an exigency,"" he says.

Of course, just what are exigent circumstances is often in the eye of the beholder, and the current court often rejected the Biden administration's assertion of exigent circumstances.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F87%2Fc36a5f8b4a94ab1b1f6cba2852cb%2Fgettyimages-2239492516.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 10:57:48.683836

About Public Citizen Litigation Group Public Citizen Litigation Group is the litigating arm of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.","Washington, D.C. — Four non-profit public-interest organizations filed a lawsuit today to challenge a new rule issued by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) that threatens to disqualify certain employers from eligibility for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The plaintiffs in the case — Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the American Immigration Council, The Door – A Center of Alternatives, Inc., and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) — are represented by Student Defense and Public Citizen Litigation Group.

ED established the new rule in response to an Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump. Finalized on October 31, the rule allows ED to disqualify employers from the PSLF program that are deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” by the Secretary of Education. Under the rule, ED will decide for itself whether this standard is met, based on its unilateral determination that an organization has engaged in activities disfavored by the administration concerning immigration, gender affirming care, and purported discrimination, along with other areas. The rule’s vague and overbroad language permits arbitrary enforcement against mission-driven organizations doing work or expressing opinions opposed by the government.

ED’s new regulation threatens to harm many of the 2.5 million federal student loan borrowers who have collectively worked more than 100 million months in public service jobs in order to qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

“The Rule will make it more difficult for employers in certain fields, such as advocacy on behalf of immigrants, to recruit and train employees, and will chill politically disfavored but legal activities by PSLF employers.” the complaint states. “The Rule is contrary to the PSLF statute, exceeds the Department’s regulatory authority, and violates the constitutional rights of nonprofits whose employees are statutorily eligible for PSLF.”

PSLF was created in 2007 to encourage students to pursue public service careers after graduation. The program offers federal student loan forgiveness to those who spend ten years repaying such loans while working full time in a public service job. The statute creating the program provides a clear list of qualifying employers, which include military service, emergency management, public health, government, public safety, law enforcement, early childhood education and library science, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, among others.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare the new rule unlawful and to declare that ED lacks the legal authority to change the statutory criteria for PSLF.

“Congress created PSLF to support those who work in public service jobs, not to let the President play favorites. The Trump administration should not be allowed to use a program designed to reward public service as a weapon against its political enemies,” said Cormac Early, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the case.

“Congress made a promise that if Americans give back to the country, the country will give back to them. Now the Trump Administration wants the power to renege on that promise if they disagree with your employer’s mission or perceived political views,” said Student Defense President Aaron Ament. “This new, unlawful rule is a slap in the face to the millions of first responders, health workers, teachers, and other public servants who believed the government could be trusted to keep its word.”

“The Trump Administration’s attack on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program strikes at the heart of civic space and public service. By targeting individuals who choose to work in nonprofits defending the human rights of immigrants and advancing diversity, inclusion, and transgender rights, this rule seeks to silence voices for equity and justice while weakening these organizations’ ability to recruit the next generation of leaders,” said Kerry Kennedy, President, RFK Human Rights.

“Public Service Loan Forgiveness was a clear commitment from the government to individuals who have dedicated themselves to public service,” said Jorge Loweree, Managing Director of Programs and Strategy at the American Immigration Council. “This regulation weaponizes that commitment. No one should be forced to choose between supporting their neighbors and securing the financial stability they were promised.”

“Latino families across the country rely on mission-driven nonprofits for immigration assistance, health care, and programs that support underserved young adults. This rule hands any administration a blank check to punish nonprofits it dislikes and jeopardizes the future of the teachers, nurses, veterans, and legal advocates who serve the public every day,” said Juan Proaño, CEO of the LULAC Institute. “LULAC Institute joined this case to defend the statute, protect our workforce, and ensure Latino borrowers are never forced to choose between serving their community and keeping a promise the government already made.”

, Part Infinity. From The New York Times:

Sean C. Dunn, a former paralegal for the Justice Department, will instead go to court to fight a misdemeanor assault charge in the August episode. A video of it circulated widely on social media, making him a symbol of local opposition to President Trump’s deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.

The case stands out for its unusual facts and the Trump administration’s determination to prosecute the man, even on a lesser charge. But it is one of a number of unusually minor cases the government is bringing to federal court at Mr. Trump’s direction.

Dunn is the guy against whom the administration wanted to throw the book because he hit an ICE officer with a sandwich. They tried to try him on felony assault, and the grand jury members on that one may not have stopped laughing yet. Anyway, the circus is certainly in town.

Leading up to the trial, federal prosecutors and Mr. Dunn’s lawyers sparred over how to properly instruct the jury, given the unusual nature of the charges. That included discussion over the definition of federal misdemeanor assault, which typically requires physical contact, and whether the incident could be considered interfering with the agent’s duties.

Jury selection could be complicated by the notoriety of the incident, after Halloween decoration tributes and posters depicting Mr. Dunn in the style of the street artist Banksy have sprouted up around the city.

The officer, Gregory Lairmore, took the stand Tuesday. His testimony may go down in legal history. From CBS News:

Lairmore, who says he caught most of Dunn’s ire before catching the sandwich in his ballistic vest, saying at one point Dunn was “red-faced” and “enraged” by the police presence at a crowded intersection in Northwest Washington, D.C. To laughs in the room, Lairmore walked the jury through the “baseball pitch” of a sub throw, as another witness put it. Lairmore said he “could feel it through his ballistic vest” and it “exploded all over” him after the Subway stack hit him. He said he “could smell the onions and mustard” on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.

If neither side calls the dry-cleaner guy as a witness, there is no justice in the world.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/person-walks-past-art-work-depicting-former-doj-employee-news-photo-1762293974.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.75019xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-11-05 12:03:13.531848

Conclusion The refugee entry suspension under the Trump administration remains one of the most controversial immigration policies in recent U.S. history.","In early 2017, the world watched as the Trump administration made one of its most controversial decisions, the suspension of refugee entry into the United States. The move was part of a broader immigration policy aimed at tightening U.S. borders and limiting the number of people entering from certain countries. For many, it was a shock. For others, it was a promise kept. But for thousands of refugees, it meant uncertainty, fear, and long waits for safety.

The Beginning of the Ban

Shortly after taking office, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order that temporarily stopped refugees from entering the country. It also placed travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

The administration argued that the pause was necessary to strengthen security checks and prevent potential threats. Trump called it a “travel ban” designed to protect Americans from terrorism. His supporters praised the decision, saying the U.S. had a right to control who entered its borders.

But critics called it a “Muslim ban”, saying it unfairly targeted people based on religion and nationality. Protests erupted across airports in the United States. Lawyers rushed to help detained travelers. The images of families separated at arrival gates went viral worldwide.

Impact on Refugees

The ban had a deep impact on refugees who had already gone through years of security screening and background checks. Many had sold their belongings, completed interviews with U.S. immigration officers, and were just waiting for their flights.

Suddenly, they were told they could not enter.

Refugees from war-torn countries like Syria and Somalia faced heartbreaking setbacks. Some were stranded in refugee camps with no clear idea of what would happen next. For many, the U.S. was seen as a safe place, a fresh start after escaping violence and persecution. That hope was suddenly taken away.

Charity groups and human rights organizations called the decision “cruel and unnecessary.” They argued that refugees were already heavily vetted and that the suspension hurt innocent families fleeing danger.

Legal Battles and Court Challenges

Almost immediately, several states and civil rights groups challenged the travel ban in court. Judges in Hawaii, Washington, and other states temporarily blocked the order, calling it unconstitutional.

But the Trump administration didn’t back down. It revised the ban multiple times to make it legally stronger and eventually took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a revised version of the travel ban, ruling that the president had the authority to restrict entry for national security reasons. It was a major win for the Trump administration, but the debate over the policy continued.

Supporters’ Point of View

Supporters of the ban said it was about safety, not discrimination. They believed that the U.S. needed time to improve its refugee screening process and ensure that people entering the country were not a threat.

Many Americans who supported the policy felt that the government had a responsibility to put citizens’ safety first. Trump often said his goal was to protect the United States from potential terrorists hiding among refugees, even though statistics showed that refugees were already among the most thoroughly vetted entrants to the country.

Opponents’ Viewpoint

Opponents, on the other hand, saw the suspension as a moral and humanitarian failure. They argued that America had always been a nation built by immigrants and that turning away refugees went against those values.

Religious groups, including many Christian and Jewish organizations, spoke out strongly against the policy. They said it was wrong to close the door on people who were running from war, poverty, and persecution.

International leaders also criticized the decision, saying it damaged America’s reputation as a global leader in humanitarian aid.

The Human Side of the Policy

Behind the politics were real human stories.

Families who had waited years for approval suddenly had their dreams put on hold. Children who were ready to start school in America found themselves stuck in refugee camps. Some families were split apart, with one parent allowed in and the other left behind.

One Syrian woman shared her story in an interview: “We were told our papers were ready. We sold everything. Then, overnight, it was gone. My children cried when we told them we couldn’t go.”

Stories like hers showed the emotional and personal cost of the refugee entry suspension.

Changes in Later Years

In 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, he ended the refugee and travel bans introduced by Trump. Biden called the bans “a stain on America’s conscience.” He promised to restore the U.S. refugee program and increase the annual refugee admission cap.

Although the bans were lifted, their effects continued to be felt. Many refugee organizations had reduced staff or funding during the suspension years, and rebuilding those systems took time. Thousands of refugees still faced long waits to enter the country.

Conclusion

The refugee entry suspension under the Trump administration remains one of the most controversial immigration policies in recent U.S. history. Supporters saw it as a necessary step for national security. Opponents saw it as discrimination disguised as safety.

In the end, the policy highlighted one of the biggest questions in modern politics:

How can a country protect itself while also protecting those in need?

The United States continues to wrestle with that question, balancing its traditions of openness and compassion with the realities of a complex, changing world.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/690b16c46cc7f2001e19641d.png",N,,2025-11-05 07:17:07.128107

The commentary focuses on the assessment of risk to former government officials and civil servants. It argues that a conclusive assessment that this profile is generally not at risk of persecution or serious harm is not supported by the country of origin information.

Published alongside the commentary is a country of origin information report focusing on the Taliban’s treatment of individuals who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021).

Background

A narrowed assessment of profiles considered at risk within the August 2024 Fear of the Taliban policy note signalled a troubling new approach to Afghan asylum claims, as previously discussed on Free Movement.

A year on, concern about the UK government’s handling of at risk Afghans continues to mount, following the closure of all resettlement routes, and the lifting of a super-injunction revealing a major data breach in 2022 affecting applicants to Afghan relocation schemes. A new version of the Fear of the Taliban policy note was published in August 2025, though with minimal changes to the country information and no updated country information on the profile of former government officials and civil servants.

Analysis of the Home Office’s assessment

Asylos’ commentary considers the profile of former government officials and civil servants, a profile which the UK government has deemed unlikely to be at risk since August 2024. The commentary argues that the country information within the policy note does not support such a conclusive assessment.

The commentary is a reminder that it is always worth checking the country information within the policy note itself, to understand to what extent the it is supportive of the policy note assessment. In this case, multiple sources in the policy note indicate that former government officials and civilian personnel have been subject to arbitrary arrests and detentions, human rights violations, various forms of torture and ill-treatment and extrajudicial killings.

The commentary also highlights that the UK government assessment is currently at odds with the European Union Agency for Asylum’s assessment, which appears to accept that individuals within this profile may be at risk:

‘Acts reported to be committed against individuals under this profile [individuals affiliated with the previous government and members of the judiciary, including court personnel and civil servants] are of such severe nature that they amount to persecution (e.g. summary executions, killing, torture, enforced disappearances). [….]

‘For judges, prosecutors, and former court personnel well-founded fear of persecution would in general be substantiated.

‘For others under this profile, the individual assessment should take into account the institution they were employed by and their role and functions. Being female and possible personal enmities may also constitute risk-impacting circumstances. Family members may also have a well-founded fear of persecution, for example in the context of the Taliban searching for the individual they are related to.’

It also runs counter to the UNHCR’s assessment in its September 2025 guidance note on Afghanistan:

‘…many persons of this profile [Afghans associated with the former government, security forces or allies] —including former government officials, previous members of the ANDSF, former prosecutors or judges and persons who were affiliated with foreign forces—are likely to be in need of international protection. Other persons of this profile may be in need of international protection depending on the individual circumstances of the case…’

The commentary further argues that the strong focus on quantitative assessment of risk distorts the correct legal test for assessing whether there is a reasonable likelihood a person would be persecuted (for a Convention reason). It is argued that this has the effect of raising the evidentiary threshold for proving that people claiming to be former government officials are at risk from the Taliban.

Finally, the commentary raises the policy note’s lack of consideration of limitations on access to information in Afghanistan. It emphasises that a lack of information on any given issue should never lead to an automatic conclusion that it is not occurring. This is particularly important in contexts like Afghanistan, where the information environment is challenging due to factors like severe restrictions on press freedom.

Why considering timely country information is so important

Despite the importance of timely country information for fair and evidence-based decision making, the August 2025 policy note does not include any updated country information on the profile of former government officials and civil servants, instead continuing to rely on country information gathered before August 2024.

Asylos’ country information report, which includes sources published between September 2024 and October 2025, may therefore be a useful resource for lawyers and decision makers.

Sources within the report reveal ongoing human rights violations against individuals against those who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021), despite the Taliban’s declared general amnesty. Of particular note, several sources report that the 2022 data leak has led to harmful consequences, including killings of those on the leaked list, or their family members.

A Telegraph report of July 2025 quoted a Taliban official confirming that the Taliban continues to use the data leaked by the UK government to track down those on the list, and that the search had intensified in recent months.

Evidence published by Refugee Legal Support in October 2025 presents information gathered in September and October 2025 from 350 Afghans affected by the data breach. The report captures threats and risks resulting from the breach, including 49 reports of killings of family members or former colleagues, 210 reports of Taliban house searches, and more than 200 incidents of threats to family, friends or individuals on the list.

Conclusion

By engaging with the country information set out in the government’s own policy note, and looking at how other asylum authorities have assessed risk, the commentary is a reminder that the same set of information can be interpreted in different ways. The country information report suggests that the risks still facing those who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021) are far from insignificant.

These documents should assist lawyers working on Afghan protection claims, as well as encouraging decision makers to continue to engage with timely country information, give due consideration to limitations on access to information, and to take a cautious approach in assessing ongoing risks.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg_.png,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:11.646790

Justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments today on the legality of using emergency powers to impose tariffs on almost every US trading partner.

In a series of executive orders issued earlier this year, Trump cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a 1977 law which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency, as he slapped steep duties on imports into the US.

The supreme court – controlled by a rightwing supermajority that was crafted by Trump – will review whether IEEPA grants the president the authority to levy a tariff, a word not mentioned in the law. Congress is granted sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes. The court has until the end of its term, in July 2026, to issue a ruling on the case.

Lower courts have ruled against Trump’s tariffs, prompting appeals from the Trump administration, setting up this latest test of Trump’s presidential power. The supreme court has largely sided with the administration through its shadow docket to overrule lower courts.

Should the supreme court ultimately rule against Trump’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs, it will force the White House to go back to the drawing board and reconsider how to enforce an aggressive economic policy which has strained global trade ties.

Should the court side with the administration, however, it will embolden a president who has repeatedly claimed – despite warnings over the risk of higher prices – that tariffs will help make America great again, raising “trillions” of dollars for the federal government and revitalizing its industrial heartlands.

Trump himself has argued the court’s decision is immensely important. The case is “one of the most important in the History of the Country”, he wrote on social media over the weekend, claiming that ruling against him would leave the US “defenseless”.

“If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR,” Trump claimed. “If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status – Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!”

But some of his senior officials have suggested that, if the court rules against their current strategy, they will find another way to impose tariffs. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who plans to attend the oral arguments in the case, has said the administration has “lots of other authorities” to do so.

According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, Trump’s tariffs amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,200 in 2025 and $1,600 in 2026.

A coalition of 12 states and small businesses, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont, have sued the Trump administration to block the tariffs.

Several other small businesses also filed suit against the Trump administration to block the tariffs. The cases, Learning Resources, Inc v Trump and Trump v VOS Selections, were consolidated by the court.

“No one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences,” Jeffrey Schwab, Liberty Justice Center’s senior counsel, said in a statement on the lawsuit filed on behalf of small businesses against the tariffs. “The Constitution gives the power to set tax rates – including tariffs – to Congress, not the President.”

About 40 legal briefs have been filed in opposition to the tariffs, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the US.

The US Chamber has urged Congress to reclaim its constitutional role in setting tariffs, stating in a letter on 27 October to the US Senate: “American families are facing thousands of dollars in higher prices as a result of these increased taxes. Small businesses, manufacturers, and ranchers are struggling with higher costs, with additional economic pain likely in the coming months.”

The US Senate voted 51 to 47 last week to nullify Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, with four Republicans joining Democrats in the vote, though the House is not expected to take similar action.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0102a4e5aea7ff695040c87ed59e1224e3cb6cc8/358_0_3575_2860/master/3575.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c2c243e997cd81eceb8230843694582",N,,2025-11-05 04:16:58.687882

Instead, as the two sides entered their 36th day at an impasse, the administration signaled it planned to ramp up the pain.

The president threatened on social media on Tuesday to deny food subsidy payments for 42 million Americans until the end of the government shutdown, in apparent defiance of a court order. (The White House press secretary later said the administration would comply with the court.)

Mr. Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, warned he might have to close parts of the national airspace next week because of the potential “mass chaos” with air traffic controller shortages.

And the White House again left open the possibility it might not follow its legal obligation to restore back pay to furloughed workers who have missed paychecks during the shutdown.

Taken together, the administration’s message was simple: Either Democrats back down from their demand to extend expiring health care subsidies, or the fallout of the shutdown will get worse.

On Wednesday after midnight, this year’s fiscal impasse pushed past 35 full days, breaking the ignominious record for the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which was previously set by the 34-day shutdown of Mr. Trump’s first term.

Unlike that standoff, the president has not involved himself in negotiations to end the current dilemma. Instead, the White House is betting that Democrats’ key constituencies will turn on them the longer they continue to refuse to support the G.O.P. plan for a short-term spending extension at current funding levels.

The administration has pointed to the calls by some union leaders for Congress to reopen the government under the Republican plan and then negotiate over health care costs.

“The Democrats obstructionism will break the record for the longest government shutdown in American history tonight,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference. “The Democrats are intentionally hurting American families, workers and businesses with this shutdown.”

When asked what Mr. Trump was doing to end the government shutdown, Ms. Leavitt said he was “pushing Republicans to keep voting” on a funding bill. Mr. Trump has invited all Republican senators for a discussion at the White House Wednesday.

It remains to be seen which party Americans will hold ultimately accountable for the paralysis in Washington. But recent public surveys show a larger share currently put the responsibility on Republicans.

“I really try to avoid making this an issue out of what the polls say, or who’s winning or losing, because nobody wins,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the top Republican in the Senate, told reporters. “Shutdowns are stupid. I’ve been here long enough to have been through a few of them. Nobody wins.”

Democrats say the president’s refusal to engage in discussions means Mr. Trump is responsible for the impact on Americans.

Speaking to reporters, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Tuesday that some informal talks were underway and that Democrats were “exploring all the options.”

But he said Mr. Trump has not involved himself.

“The fault of this shutdown falls on his shoulders,” Mr. Schumer said. “He’s refused to discuss anything with us.”

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, said Democrats would not back down until they secured a deal to improve health care benefits.

“Donald Trump is unlawfully withholding billions of dollars in SNAP benefits from 42 million Americans and 16 million children,” said Mr. Jeffries, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “There’s nothing to be optimistic about relative to the cruelty and the pain that Donald Trump and Republicans continue to inflict on the American people.”

He suggested Democrats could gain more political momentum for their position with wins in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey Tuesday night.

“It’s over for these people,” he said of Republicans before polls closed, “and we’re going to see it today, and we’re going to see it during the midterm elections.”

For weeks the Trump administration has played a game of winners and losers with the shutdown, aiming to mitigate the harm to the military and law enforcement, while ramping up the pressure on Democratic constituencies. Mr. Trump has used the fiscal impasse to halt funding to Democratic jurisdictions, and tried to lay off thousands of federal workers.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the pain would intensify.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said that food stamp benefits under SNAP “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”

Hours after that ultimatum, Ms. Leavitt appeared to walk back the president’s comments. She told reporters at a news briefing that the administration was “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments in November.

The White House declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump’s plans. The Agriculture Department which administers the program, did not respond to a request for comment.

For his part, Mr. Duffy, the transportation secretary, warned of “mass chaos” in the skies.

“You will see mass chaos, you will see mass flight delays, you will see mass cancellations,” he said during a news conference, accusing Democrats of perpetuating what he called a “senseless shutdown.”

“And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it because we don’t have the air traffic controllers,” he said.

The most recent notifications from agencies to federal workers about the shutdown omitted any language that furloughed employees would receive back pay, which is guaranteed under a law that Mr. Trump signed in 2019.

Ms. Leavitt would not commit to the administration complying with the law, saying Tuesday that the matter was the subject of negotiations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/04/multimedia/04dc-shutdown-ghfz/04dc-shutdown-ghfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:03.355174

Last updated Nov. 4 at 11:14 a.m.

Attorneys representing Chicago journalists and protesters filed a notice Monday alleging that Department of Homeland Security agents violated a temporary restraining order during immigration enforcement operations in Evanston on Friday.

The notice is a recent development in a suit brought by the Chicago Headline Club, other media organizations and protesters against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and other top federal administrators. Filed in October, the suit stems from federal responses to protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.

Judge Sara Ellis first granted a temporary restraining order Oct. 9. The order places restrictions on federal agents in the Northern District of Illinois, including limiting their use of force and riot control weapons and requiring agents to display visible identification.

In the notice, the plaintiffs’ attorneys allege DHS agents violated the order during operations on Halloween in Evanston by using excessive force against protesters, subjecting protesters to risk and harm, deploying pepper spray on a non-violent crowd without warning, threatening the use of excessive force against non-violent protesters and failing to wear numbers and badges.

On Halloween, Evanston saw significant activity by federal immigration enforcement agencies. The DHS made at least eight arrests across Evanston and Skokie on Friday, including both protesting citizens and those it said lacked legal status, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to The Daily. At least three arrests occurred after a collision involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle less than a block from Chute Middle School.

The notice includes signed declarations by three Evanston residents.

In the first declaration, Kerry Littel detailed a confrontation between “more than a dozen” community members and federal immigration agents after the collision involving a Border Patrol vehicle.

According to Littel’s declaration, federal agents sat on top of a man, grabbed his head and bashed it on the street at least twice. Littel claimed that the agent then struck the man on the head at least two times before picking him up and putting him in their vehicle.

Video footage documenting this confrontation — and those recorded by the other residents — is also included in the notice.

On Saturday, before the notice was filed, DHS Assistant Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reposted one of the videos included on X, showing a Border Patrol agent pinning the man on the ground and striking him multiple times.

In the post, McLaughlin claimed the agent’s actions were motivated by self-defense after the man grabbed the agent’s genitals. At the start of the video, one of the man’s hands is clearly behind his back and the other is out of view.

In another declaration, Evanston resident David Brooks alleges that while he was in a crowd of protesters at the scene, an agent pointed a gun directly at him. Brooks wrote that the agent said “step back or I’m going to shoot you,” shown in one of the included videos.

The notice also claims agents “set off either pepper spray or mace” without warning the crowd of protesters and that multiple agents appeared to lack visible identification.

A third declaration, by Evanston resident Kelly Mack, described a separate interaction where she saw a neighbor shoved by an immigration agent without an audible warning.

The court’s temporary restraining order instructs that the defendants are temporarily prohibited from using force against “an individual who poses no immediate threat of physical harm to others, unless necessary and proportional to effectuate an apprehension and arrest.”

It also blocks them from seizing or arresting peaceful protesters who are not resisting lawful crowd dispersal orders, without probable cause to believe they have committed a crime that warrants arrest. The order also contains a provision requiring all federal agents — with some exceptions for those who do not wear uniforms or those who are undercover — to have visible identification prominently displayed.

The notice alleges that the defendants violated each of these provisions.

The lawyers representing the plaintiffs and defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A preliminary injunction hearing for the case is slated for Wednesday morning at Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Downtown Chicago.

But that is precisely the point; across time and political swings, the concept of due process has not changed.
No one can be labeled without due process, and due process applies to every person.","Recently, I made the mistake of responding on social media to a post about immigration. It is an important topic to me because it’s an important part of what my organization does.

The Center for Victim and Human Rights (CVHR), which I founded almost 18 years ago, provides legal services to victims of crime—some of whom are immigrants.

I use the term ‘mistake’ because, if you’ve ever read an online thread on immigration, you already know how it went. It looked something like this:

Comment: “Get rid of these illegals!”

Me: “They are entitled to due process.”

Response: “[Insert pejorative here]. Due process is for citizens, and besides—they’re illegal.”

I couldn’t help but go down the proverbial ‘rabbit hole.’ What does it mean to label someone ‘illegal’ and ‘who is entitled to due process in an immigration case?’

I want to examine whether it really does apply in immigration cases.

‘They’re illegal.’ Prove it—process matters.

The framers of the Constitution did not invent due process; they inherited it from centuries of English law, most notably the Magna Carta’s promise that no person could be deprived of liberty except by the “law of the land.”

Even in immigration law, the term “illegal” obscures more than it explains. The Immigration and Nationality Act defines “aliens” and specifies offenses like unlawful entry (8 U.S.C. §1325) and reentry after removal (8 U.S.C. §1326), but nowhere does it label a person as “illegal.”

Most immigration violations are civil, not criminal. Overstaying a visa, working without authorization or entering without inspection have been historically addressed through removal proceedings—not crimes. In those proceedings, the government—not the person—bears the burden to prove removability. That is what due process demands.

To reach the decision that someone should not be here, however, requires due process. Similar to a criminal case, the government has the burden of proving that a person has committed specific violations and is subject to deportation.

This has been the law of the land for at least 122 years.

More than a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed this principle. In Yamataya v. Fisher (1903), the court held that “the liberty of an individual, even though he be an alien, is protected by the Fifth Amendment” and that “no deportation proceeding…shall be taken unless there be an opportunity, appropriate to the case, to be heard.”

The ruling established that before the government may remove someone, it must first provide notice and a fair hearing.

Process comes before punishment.

Half a century later, in Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding (1953), the Court reaffirmed that a lawful permanent resident could not be denied reentry without notice of the charges and a hearing. Justice Frankfurter wrote that a person’s status as a lawful resident “has not been lost by his absence” and that “before his expulsion, he is entitled to notice of the nature of the charge and a hearing at least before an executive or administrative tribunal.”

In other words, once the Constitution calls someone a person, the government must treat them as one.

‘They’re not citizens.’ It does not matter.

The opening phrases of the Fifth and 14th Amendments both begin with the same word: person. The Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be held…,” and the 14th begins, “All persons…”

This may seem like “lawyer parsing” but it is more than mere semantics. In fact, it may be the most important word in the entire concept of due process.

The idea that due process protections are afforded to persons, not just citizens, has echoed across generations: Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) held that the 14th Amendment’s protections apply to “all persons within the territorial jurisdiction”; Wong Wing v. United States (1896) struck down imprisonment of Chinese laborers without trial; Plyler v. Doe (1982) invalidated a Texas law denying education to undocumented children; and Zadvydas v. Davis (2001) ruled that even those ordered removed cannot be detained indefinitely. Across more than a century of conflict and change, the Supreme Court has said the same thing: due process is not a reward for citizenship, it is a restraint on government. Its strength lies in its universality.

Your politics, not mine.

This discussion as political rhetoric may easily be dismissed as ideological rhetoric. But that is precisely the point; across time and political swings, the concept of due process has not changed.

Due process must always be apolitical because it ensures that the government may never overreach, especially when our identities and politics don’t align.

Consider an important modern test of the same principle: the January 6th prosecutions.

For many of us—including me—our first reaction was outrage. The images of shattered glass, battered officers, and a mob storming the seat of our democracy were seared into the national memory.

As a lawyer, and as someone who has spent much of my career on the side of law and order, I would have volunteered to be on the front lines prosecuting those cases. But outrage does not suspend due process.

Some defendants were charged with serious violent crimes; others faced misdemeanors such as trespass or disorderly conduct. A few spent months in pretrial detention awaiting hearings delayed again and again.

None of that excuses the conduct of that day. But it reminds us that due process does not hinge on our approval of the accused, it depends on whether the government honors the rights of persons, all persons.

We may disagree with immigration policy or the boundaries of enforcement, but the Constitution’s language does not waver. No one can be labeled without due process, and due process applies to every person.

The moment we let fear, politics or prejudice decide who falls outside that circle, we abandon not just others but the rule of law itself.

Due process protects the best of us by ensuring it protects the whole of us. It demands that before liberty or life is taken, the government must answer to law, not impulse. And one day, it may be all that stands between us and the arbitrary exercise of power.•

Fernanda Castorena, the program services coordinator at the UCC, shared that the UCC is a place where students can find academic support, legal counseling, and resources specifically for undocumented students.","For many immigrant students at Skyline College, immigration is not just an act of resilience, but a means of survival.

“If we go back, especially with our background of organizing for our rights, for human rights in Burma, we could literally be arrested or worse, killed. We cannot go back home, and we are not welcome here,” said Martin Tun, a Skyline student.

Tun immigrated to the U.S. as an international student from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). He reflected on how the current increase in federal immigration enforcement has led to heightened unease and fear around being an immigrant right now in America.

Student refugees from Myanmar are not the only community at Skyline feeling the impact of escalated immigration enforcement. Undocumented students are faced with a similar intersection of challenges and concerns.

Over the summer, the expansion of immigration enforcement was catalyzed when Congress signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into Law. This bill allocates $170.7 billion to immigration enforcement. It also enables authorization of more detentions and immigration related arrests, expanding upon and building new detention facilities across the country, and expediting ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) capacity for immigration enforcement.

Alexa Moore, a student at Skyline College who is part of the Unlocking Futures Fellowship in the Undocumented Community Center (UCC), shared how fear for safety can make it hard to prioritize school.

“When it comes to the Trump administration, it’s very difficult for students to focus on trying to pursue higher education when thinking of ‘if I go to school, something might happen to me in school,” Moore said. “Something might happen to me in public.’ If I were to be detained, that’s a waste of my time just to be sent back.”

Rebecca Pwint, who came to Skyline College as an international student, reflected on connections she has seen between her experience in Myanmar and now as a resident in the U.S.

“Before, people would be very excited to get their court dates for interviews and stuff. Now everyone is scared because of ICE detaining outside of the courtrooms,” Pwint said. “It’s like reliving the days in Burma, but I would say with more advanced technology…they are tracking your phone, they know where you are, you feel like you are watched all the time.”

In addition to safety concerns, immigrant students at Skyline also shared about the sacrifices their families are facing. ​

Moore explained she is now in a position to transfer to a university, and with that comes further financial strain on her family.

“What’s the point in doing all of this? When something might happen to me or my family, and then we might end up having to go back?” said Moore. “I don’t want it to be a waste of my parents’ time coming here.”

​Pwint shared a similar sentiment to Moore on parents sacrificing their time and resources.

“They have to sell their properties and jewelry to support us, and that burden is so heavy that you can’t help but sometimes feel helpless,” Pwint said.

Pwint explained how she feels there is more context needed to understand the experience of student immigrants from Myanmar.

“For us, I feel like there is another layer to being an immigrant, which is the [military] coup back home…I also came as an international student, having to pay about $8,000 a semester, when you know your family cannot afford it.” Pwint said, “But you are also forced to flee here because of the conscription law back home; with the coup, they will start killing you.

Pwint explained how the financial strain on families adds more pressure to the experience.

“So you can’t help but feel like a burden to your family because it’s a financial burden that they also have to endure that they’re not capable of, to be honest,” said Pwint.

The military coup in Myanmar started in 2021 when the democratically elected government was overthrown and taken over by the military. This coup was opposed by civilians and led to armed resistance to martial law.

Three years into the military coup, a conscription law was formally announced, endangering youth in the country. Although the law states that only people between 18-35 years of age will be drafted, according to Human Rights Watch, military recruiters have been kidnapping and forcing children to become soldiers.

“The conscription law was announced by the military regime in February 2024; rather than just conscription or military drafting, it was more of a forced kidnapping law.” Tun said, “This is the same military regime that almost the entirety of the Burmese population opposed, that we did not vote for.”

Tun explained that the conscription law was declared by the military regime in Feb. 2024. He shared that instead of just military drafting, the law induced kidnapping and killing.

“They overthrew our elected government, and when we peacefully protested, they did not just crack down on the protestors, but thousands were shot to death. Thousands of peaceful protesters were killed by them, and that’s the same military that is now asking us to serve in the military in turn to kill our own people,” Tun said.

Tun said how, upon coming to America, he saw a connection between the manner in which ICE is detaining people and the regime in Myanmar, in regards to forcibly taking people without regard for the age specified in the conscription law.

“In practice, it is similar to what ICE is doing. They don’t really care if you look like a youth, even if you are 16, they might just drag you, and the next thing you know, your child is just lost,” Tun said.

Skyline College offers support and community for immigrant students at Skyline. One of those resources for students is the UCC.

Fernanda Castorena, the program services coordinator at the UCC, shared that the UCC is a place where students can find academic support, legal counseling, and resources specifically for undocumented students.

“This work is really personal to me because I was… an undocumented community college student myself, and so this work is really personal to me,” Castorena said.

Castorena talked about how she is dedicated to providing her students with the best resources and support that she can.

“I think each time that I meet with students, I carry that understanding and that empathy into the things that are currently affecting us, and so because of that, I try to make sure that everything that I am providing students with is the most accurate up-to-date information,” Castorena said.

Aaron Torres Mendoza, a student a part of the Unlocking Futures Fellowship in the UCC shared how the resources he has found at Skyline have allowed him to continue as a college student.

“Without those resources, I don’t think I would still be here continuing to seek my higher education,” Torres Mendoza said.

Torres Mendoza explained that while there are resources available at Skyline for undocumented students, there is room for more support, especially when it comes to financial aid and scholarship opportunities.

“I see my citizen peers getting access to scholarships that give them thousands of dollars per semester or internships that pay them better hourly wages while they’re continuing in school. Not much of that is given to undocumented students,” Torres Mendoza said. “For me, I’m lucky to even find a scholarship that’s a couple of hundred dollars.”

Torres Mendoza also said that in the Stem Center, there is a wall of flyers with scholarship opportunities, most of which are not available to undocumented students. He shared that a separate section with opportunities accessible to undocumented students would be helpful.

In addition, Pwint said she would like to see a plan of action for students with vulnerable citizenship status to feel safe at Skyline.

Pwint mentioned how there are drills to prepare students for a variety of emergencies such as school shootings, and that ICE presence at school should be included on the list.

“I would like to see a more concrete stance and plans, if we can do drills, and a better way to communicate, rather than just text messages where there is no signal,” Pwint said. “Concrete steps would bring more comfort for us to be on campus.”

Tun and Pwint have been able to find community at Skyline through being a part of the Myanmar Student Union (MSU).

“I was able to go to my first meeting and learn more about it and find my hope. I felt so guilty about leaving the country and leaving my comrades behind,” Pwint said.

The MSU is a political organization that advocates and provides a community for Burmese students at Skyline. Over the years, the MSU has organized fundraisers for humanitarian aid in Myanmar, art builds, cultural festivals, carnivals, panels, a political play, and much more.

“I feel comfort in it [MSU], the support and the community here, and other people also fighting for national liberation, people who really listen to you and understand you. It’s not home, but it feels like home,” Pwint shared.

Tun adds to the importance of camaraderie among immigrants and students at this time, reflecting on the important role immigrants have always played in America.

“This whole country is built on the backs of immigrant labor, and that is the power we as immigrants have and need to realize,” Tun said.

Lastly, he noted that collective action is the strongest solution.

“The fact that there are so few of them, as in the billionaires and the rich few who are making all these oppressive policies upon the people,” Tun said. “We have so many of us, as long as you don’t see it as an individual problem and instead as a societal problem, a problem for all of us… We are definitely stronger.”",https://www.theskylineview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ABAZRhcEUJqIbW2LEu2Ab76SxeZtZIo7ofyfFa6B.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:23.051694

On Oct. 31 this year, the appeals court vacated the huge verdict against the landlord and remanded the case for a new trial.

The trial judge had given the jury improper instructions on premises liability, the appellate judges said. Despite the appeals court noting that the landlord had failed to install smoke detectors and sprinkler systems as required by law and regulation, “we conclude as a matter of law that the cause of the injury lay in an area possessed by Hughes (the deceased victim) and that it was error to charge the jury on premises liability law,” the opinion reads.

Instead, because the fire was set in a closet – not a common area at the complex – the jury should have been educated on landlord liability law, which exempts landlords from general landowner liability, the appeals court wrote.

The effect of the erroneous jury instruction was “to supplant the landlord’s limited duty to keep the premises in repair with ‘a harsher rule of responsibility than that to which it was already subject,'” the court wrote, citing a 1933 court ruling.

A further appeal by the Hughes estate are expected.

In a second opinion this week, the case involved allegations that may sound familiar to auto insurers: An Atlanta plaintiffs’ law firm was allegedly stirring up litigation with illegal ambulance chasing. No, it was not an insurance company making the accusations. It was another injury lawyer.

In Cambre vs. Lazenby, the appellate court on Nov. 3 found that a lower court should have dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit. The case started in 2024 when Gainesville, Georgia, lawyer Shane Lazenby filed suit against Cambre & Associates, an Atlanta injury law firm.

Cambre was obtaining information about auto accident victims before that information was made public, then sending runners to solicit the victims as clients, often using high-pressure tactics, Lazenby alleged. Such practices are illegal under Georgia statutes and state Bar rules, the plaintiffs said.

Lazenby argued that the alleged ambulance chasing and “case running” gave the Cambre firm an unfair business advantage and constituted racketeering – in violation of Georgia’s Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. A trial court refused to dismiss the lawsuit, which Cambre’s team had said failed to state a claim or allege all necessary elements of a RICO violation. The appeals court disagreed.

“The facts alleged in support of Lazenby’s RICO claim are simply too attenuated and speculative to form the proximate cause of the supposed financial losses theoretically incurred by Lazenby and others similarly situated,” the appellate judges wrote.

In a third case, the appeals court found the opposite – that a trial court should not have dismissed a RICO suit brought by two whistleblowers stemming from a construction firm’s allegedly fraudulent immigration paperwork.

In Wommack vs. G.S. Construction, two human resources directors charged that the contractor had maintained a trove of fake documents purporting to show that illegal immigrant workers were fully documented.

The HR managers “discovered documents, such as fake social security cards, handwritten social security numbers, and fake permanent resident cards, that indicated the defendants were assisting these employees in committing identity fraud,” the court explained. Fraudulent drug screenings were also provided, the HR manager argued.

After insisting that she was required to report the unlawful employment, the first HR manager, Amy Weavear, was fired. Another one, Steven Wommack, was hired, and then fired in a similar manner, the court opinion said. Following their terminations, the plaintiffs filed a Georgia RICO civil complaint.

Illegal immigrant labor can potentially affect workers’ compensation, builder’s risk and commercial liability insurance coverage, by underreporting payroll and the level of risk involved. Some construction firms around the country have long been accused of hiring undocumented aliens and faking insurance coverage or deceiving insurance carriers.

“Both plaintiffs asserted not only that they suffered financial injury, including loss of wages, but also mental and emotional distress, and damage to their reputations,” the appeals court noted in the Wommack decision.

The trial court found that Georgia courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have held that a fired employee cannot turn the termination into a RICO suit. But the appellate judges said that the case law that those court decisions had relied on were not exactly on-point for this case. The plaintiff HR managers had alleged that the RICO violations were directly harmful to them and were made in furtherance of a scheme to profit from unauthorized immigrant labor.

“At this stage, because the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants’ acts or threats were intended to deter them from reporting the defendants’ criminal activity or later testifying, in violation of OCGA § 16-10-32(b) or OCGA § 16-10 93(b), the plaintiffs have each alleged that the defendants directed a predicate offense at them and that they suffered direct harm as a result—which is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss,” the appellate court wrote.",https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/11/ambulance-Adobe-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:18.266938

It is truly un-American.” Political tension across the nation is high as California voters cast ballots on Proposition 50,.
“California voters will not be sidelined from exercising their constitutional right to vote and should not let anyone deter them from exercising that right,” Weber said.
Los Angeles residents alone have cast more than 788,000 mail-in ballots.
Over the last month, the stakes in the California special election have ratcheted up as polls indicate Proposition 50 could pass.","As California voters went to the polls Tuesday to cast their ballot on a measure that could block President Trump’s national agenda, state officials ridiculed his unsubstantiated claims that voting in the largely Democratic state is “rigged.”

“The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,” Trump said on Truth Social just minutes after polling stations opened Tuesday across California.

The president provided no evidence for his allegations.

“All ‘Mail-In’ Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,’ is under very serious legal and criminal review,” the GOP president wrote. “STAY TUNED!”

Gov. Gavin Newsom dismissed the president’s claims on X as “the ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE.”

In a video, Newsom said Trump had a history of “doing everything he can to suppress the vote.” The governor also used Trump’s latest claims to persuade Californians of the value of Proposition 50, Newsom’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 election to favor the Democratic Party.

“He has folks dressed up in tactical gear, ICE and border patrol — 100 plus officers in L.A. as I speak — to intimidate and chill free expression, free speech, to intimidate voters; He does not believe in fair and free elections,” Newsom said of Trump. “What more evidence do we need of the importance of Proposition 50?”

At a White House briefing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed, without providing examples, that California was receiving ballots in the name of undocumented immigrants who could not legally vote.

Asked what evidence Trump had that the voting underway in California is ‘rigged,’” Leavitt said: “They have a universal mail-in voting system, which we know is ripe for fraud.”

“Fraudulent ballots that are being mailed in in the names of other people, in the names of illegal aliens who shouldn’t be voting in American elections,” Leavitt added. “There’s countless examples and we’d be happy to provide them.”

Pressed for details, a White House staffer pointed to a September New York Post story about a Costa Mesa woman who faced felony charges in Orange County for registering her dog to vote and casting multiple ballots.

While no other examples from this election were provided, the official said California does not use voter ID. About 36 states do have laws requiring or requesting voters show identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but California is one of 14 states and Washington, D.C., that use other methods to verify voters’ identity.

Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat who wrote the 2021 law to make California a universal vote-by-mail state, said that voting by mail is safe and bipartisan. In 2017, he noted, Trump set up a presidential commission to search the country for cases of voter fraud.

“Six months later he disbanded the commission after no voter fraud was found,” Berman said. “This time is no different, but damage is still being done by this incessant eroding of Americans’ faith in our democracy. It is truly un-American.”

Political tension across the nation is high as California voters cast ballots on Proposition 50,. The measure is intended to offset GOP gerrymandering in red states after Trump pressed Texas to rejigger maps to shore up the GOP’s narrow House majority.

California’s top elections official, Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, called Trump’s allegation “another baseless claim.”

“The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,” Weber said in a statement. “California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.”

Weber noted that more than 7 million Californians have already voted and encouraged those who had yet to cast ballots to go to the polls.

“California voters will not be sidelined from exercising their constitutional right to vote and should not let anyone deter them from exercising that right,” Weber said.

Of the 7 million Californians who have voted, more than 4.6 million have done so by mail, according to the secretary of state’s office. Los Angeles residents alone have cast more than 788,000 mail-in ballots.

Leavitt told D.C. reporters Tuesday that the White House is working on an executive order to combat so-called “blatant” election fraud.

“The White House is working on an executive order to strengthen our election in this country,” Leavitt said, “and to ensure that there cannot be blatant fraud, as we’ve seen in California with their universal mail-in voting system.”

Trump has long criticized mail-in voting. As more Democrats opted to vote by mail in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the president repeatedly made unproven claims linking mail in voting with voter fraud. When Trump ultimately lost that election, he blamed expanded mail-in voting.

In March, Trump signed an executive order requiring that Attorney General Pam Bondi “take all necessary action” against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day. Most states count mail-in or absentee ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

Over the last month, the stakes in the California special election have ratcheted up as polls indicate Proposition 50 could pass. More than half of likely California voters said they planned to support the measure, which could allow Democrats to gain up to five House seats.

Last month, the Justice Department appeared to single out California for particular national scrutiny: It announced it would send federal monitors to polling locations in counties in California as well as New Jersey, another traditionally Democratic state that is conducting nationally significant off-year elections.

The monitors, it said, would be sent to five California counties: Los Angeles, Kern, Riverside, Fresno and Orange.

While Trump is often a flame-thrower on social media, he has largely been silent on Proposition 50, aside from a few Truth Social posts.

In late October, the president voiced skepticism with California’s mail-in ballots and early voting — directly contradicting efforts by the state’s GOP leaders to get people to vote.

“No mail-in or ‘Early’ Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is! Millions of Ballots being ‘shipped,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “GET SMART REPUBLICANS, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a37cf62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+422/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F7a%2F3ada68ff45c6b31c4b55cc709106%2F1528054-me-election-prop-50-05-db.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:11.672490

The preliminary injunction hearing stems from a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force, including tear gas, during demonstrations.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis has already ordered agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.

The hearing comes after Ellis questioned senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino at a public hearing last week, where she took the rare step of ordering him to brief her each evening on the federal immigration crackdown in Chicago. That move was swiftly blocked by an appeals court.

On Tuesday, Bovino appeared in court yet again for a deposition — a private interview — with lawyers from both sides. Parts of the videotaped deposition will be played in court Wednesday, according to court filings.

Attorneys may also call to the stand a pastor who was hit in the head by a container containing a chemical agent while praying outside a federal immigration facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, local officials detained during protests outside the facility, and a protester who alleges she was hit by a flash-bang grenade that caused temporary hearing loss, court records show.

Court filings released late Monday night shed light on a previous deposition by Bovino in which he acknowledged tossing tear gas and being hit by a rock in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village last month. Bovino also testified that he has “instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations,"" court records show.

Meanwhile, a federal judge is expected to rule Wednesday afternoon after a group of detainees filed a class-action lawsuit against federal authorities, alleging “inhuman” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman called the alleged conditions “unnecessarily cruel” after hearing people held at the facility detail overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer.” He called for the hearing to reconvene at 4:15 p.m. local time Wednesday so that he can issue a temporary restraining order to address the conditions.

Courthouse to accommodate what is expected to be a large contingent of media and spectators.

At one point, Bovino was captured on video throwing tear gas above the heads of the crowd without warning and “despite an absence of threats or violence,” the filing alleged.","Nearly two months into “Operation Midway Blitz,” the controversial use-of-force tactics by immigration agents under the Trump administration will take center stage Wednesday in a Chicago federal courtroom, where a judge is deciding whether to put more long-term restrictions on the use of tear gas and other chemical agents on crowds and provide enhanced protections for protesters and media.

Among the evidence expected to be presented to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis during Wednesday’s preliminary injunction hearing: portions of sworn deposition testimony from Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and other immigration officials; footage from at least a dozen body-worn cameras agents were wearing during clashes with citizens across the city; and claims made by Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that force was appropriate to quell violent “rioters” who were attacking officers.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and could last well into the evening, as a temporary restraining order issued by Ellis as part of the underlying lawsuit expires on Thursday and the judge will have to decide quickly on whether to grant the requested remedies.

The case has received national attention, and an overflow courtroom has been set up at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse to accommodate what is expected to be a large contingent of media and spectators.

The hearing will be lacking at least one element of spectacle: Bovino will not have to appear as a live witness in court, as the plaintiffs agreed to drop that demand in exchange for an additional 90 minutes of deposition time.

But the 30-year Border Patrol veteran will certainly be front-and-center anyways. In arguments before Ellis on Tuesday, plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said they intend to play parts of Bovino’s deposition that will show he lied under oath, including making up “a story about getting hit in the head with a rock” in Little Village last month to justify personally lobbing tear gas canisters into the crowd.

The lawsuit filed by the Chicago Headline Club and a consortium of other media groups allege immigration officials have systematically violated the constitutional rights of protesters and reporters during the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement action, which began in earnest in mid-September and has shown no signs of slowing.

In laying out their case, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a motion early Tuesday that the evidence in the case shows without injunctive relief, immigration agents “will continue to act as if they can use weapons of war to commit shocking acts of violence against civilians—protesters, press, clergy, bystanders, pregnant women, children—with impunity.”

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said that while Department of Homeland Security policy emphasizes respect for human life, de-escalation, and use of safe tactics, agents have a right to use necessary force to protect themselves and enforce lawful orders.

“Rioters have attacked law enforcement personnel with fireworks, rocks, and other objects,” the government filing stated. “Rioters also breached the perimeter of federal buildings, blocked all traffic into the only immigration facility in the region, damaged federal vehicles, and injured officers. At some violent protests, officers responded by issuing dispersal orders and using nonlethal crowd-control devices.”

The Department of Justice also said issuing a preliminary injunction would “continue the judicial micromanaging of immigration enforcement actions” and cause officers to hesitate in the field before protecting themselves or the public “out of fear of contempt.”

Before the hearing begins Wednesday, the parties will be going over a litany of last-minute issues, including whether portions of the proceedings should be sealed from public view.

Department of Justice attorney Elizabeth Hedges argued Tuesday they have not had time to make redactions to officer reports or body cam footage and that the courtroom should be cleared to avoid any inadvertent dissemination of officers’ identifications or non-public Homeland Security tactics or policies.

Art called that argument a “farce.”

“They can’t just seal an American courtroom…based on some vague notion that there is a danger to officers,” Art said.

Ellis asked for a list of everything the Department of Justice thought should be under seal and a brief description on why, and she would rule on the issue ahead of the hearing Wednesday. But she made clear she is not inclined to seal agents’ identifications.

“No other law enforcement officer, unless that officer is operating in an undercover capacity, has his or her identity sealed in a case,” Ellis said. “If a police officer files a report, everybody knows who that police officer is and that is revealed in open court.”

In their motion requesting an injunction, the plaintiffs laid out a series of high-profile incidents over the last month, including clashes between immigration officers in Chicago neighborhoods as well as in the suburbs. The motion accused agents and their supervisors of exaggerating the threat posed by citizens protesting arrests and filming immigration activities and, in many cases, lying about the force used to subdue them.

In one episode from the Lakeview neighborhood on Oct. 24, videos showed that one agent mocked the “vocal but nonviolent crowd of protesters” as tear gas was deployed, saying twice, “have fun!” and laughing at the protesters after the canister went off, according to the plaintiff’s filing.

“The agent then yelled ‘throw another one’ and prepared a second canister,” the filing stated. “Similarly, one agent told another, ‘Hey, throw it (tear gas) for fun.'”

The plaintiffs also alleged that some of the lies have come from Bovino himself, the person identified as the overall leader of “Operation Midway Blitz.”

In his sworn deposition, which lasted 6 1/2 hours over three days, Bovino testified he did not use force against a male protester who was yelling at him outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview on Oct. 3, the filing stated. Those assertions had been echoed by ICE Field Director Russell Hott, who claimed in public statements after the incident that Bovino had been assaulted.

But video from the scene showed the man never touched Bovino. Instead, the commander turned toward the man as he was obeying an order to move back and said, “What’d you say?” then climbed over a railing and tackled him to the ground, the filing alleged.

“Bovino’s denial that he applied force against Blackburn and Hott’s echo of this lie undermines the credibility of both witnesses, as well as the government’s broader contentions about rampant violence by protesters,” the plaintiff’s filing stated.

The motion also called into question the government’s claims about a recent incident in Little Village, where Bovino was seen leading an immigration action that targeted a laundromat and discount mall and sparked vehement protests on the streets.

At one point, Bovino was captured on video throwing tear gas above the heads of the crowd without warning and “despite an absence of threats or violence,” the filing alleged.

According to the filing, body-worn camera video turned over as part of the litigation showed Bovino telling his officers, “if you need to deploy gas, you deploy (expletive) gas.” One of the officers allegedly responded, “No, we’re good. We’re good. We’re ready to move out whenever you are,” the filing said.

Instead of the agents moving on, more violence ensued, including one agent who fired a pepper spray ball at close range and threw more tear gas at the crowd, “all without warning,” the filing alleged.

Lauren Boebert is facing criticism over a racially insensitive Halloween costume, after she was pictured at a party on Friday dressed in traditional Mexican attire, accompanied by a date dressed as an ICE agent.

The MAGA politician was spotted at the party in Loveland, Colorado, wearing a sombrero and holding up a chalkboard sign that read: “Mexican Word of the Day: Juicy. Tell me if juicy ICE coming.”

Her boyfriend, real estate broker Kyle Pearcy, was dressed as an ICE operative in camouflage uniform, flack jacket, and baseball cap.

A spokesperson for Rep. Boebert’s office told The Independent: “It’s a Halloween costume. Tell our senators to vote for the CR [continuing resolution] and open the government. They are choosing to let millions of American families suffer.”

The Independent has also contacted the DHS, and ICE for comment.

President Donald Trump has appropriated the sombrero over the last month for use in a series of memes mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, most recently on a spoof MySpace page, as part of his attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

Boebert’s choice of costume appeared to be marrying that trend with a reference to the administration’s nationwide crackdown on undocumented migrants, which has principally targeted the Hispanic populations of Democrat-run cities.

Among those posting pictures from the party was Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat running to unseat Boebert, who wrote on X: “Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.”

A person who was present at the party told ABC News, “It is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. Even the conservatives [at the party] were in shock. People avoided them.”

Also responding was Stacy Suniga, the president of the Latino Coalition of Weld County in Colorado, who told The Denver Post: “She should be ashamed of herself. Though I believe she is incapable of any emotion that generates human decency. Her bigotry and ignorance are clearly evident in her chosen apparel this day.”

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, co-chair of the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus, urged Boebert to apologize and said she “should know that our culture is not a costume and being bilingual is an asset, not a joke.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in Virginia have nearly tripled under President Donald Trump's leadership compared to the previous administration, prompting Homeland Security to call out some of the state's ""worst of the worst"" dangerous and violent offenders captured just last week in the state.

The undocumented immigrant offenders highlighted by DHS came from Central America and the Caribbean, including El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, their crimes ranged from drug smuggling to domestic violence, rape, ""carnal abuse,"" making terroristic threats, extortion and more.

""This past week, ICE took down sexual predators, drug traffickers, rapists, abusers and other violent thugs across the Commonwealth,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""These arrests underscore the reality of open border and sanctuary policies that allowed criminals around the world to come to America and roam free across our country. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the U.S. is closed to lawbreakers. We will continue to use every available tool to make America safe again.""

MAJOR BLUE COUNTY IN HOT SEAT AFTER VIOLENT ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTED 10 TIMES FINALLY NABBED BY ICE

One of the offenders from Guatemala, Westher Antonio Jacobo Morales, was previously deported in 2016, but committed a felony when he chose to come back and re-enter illegally once again, according to DHS. Arrested last week by ICE officers in Richmond, Morales has a rap sheet that includes rape, extortion and violating a court order.

A second offender from Guatemala, Daniel Soc-Patzan, entered the country illegally in 2013 and was issued a final order of removal that same year. He was arrested last week by ICE officials in Richmond as well. According to DHS, Soc-Patzan has a rap sheet including multiple infractions for assault and aggravated domestic violence.

Meanwhile, another illegal immigrant criminal highlighted by DHS had a criminal history involving ""carnal abuse"" and sexual assault. That individual, Harvin Francisco Rivera-Diaz, was arrested last week in Richmond after illegally crossing the southern border from Nicaragua in 2022 under the former Biden administration.

Adolfo Flores Ramirez, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, was arrested the same day, in Northern Virginia's Loudoun County. His criminal history included charges of driving under the influence, domestic violence and assault.

In addition to undocumented immigrants from Central America, ICE officials in Virginia picked up criminal illegal aliens from the Caribbean as well.

One from Jamaica, Shannovan Emeil Facey, was issued a final order of removal in 2013 but has managed to stay in the United States until now after his arrest in Richmond. His criminal history includes drug smuggling, drug possession and weapons charges, according to DHS.

A second criminal illegal alien from the Caribbean included a man from the Dominican Republic who was arrested last week by ICE agents in Norfolk. The man, Elvin Tiburcio Mirambeaux, has a criminal history including making terroristic threats and drug possession.

Past ""worst of the worst"" roundups include arrests made in Los Angeles of illegal immigrant gang members, murderers and child predators.

For example, Mexican national Juan Carlos Marin-Hipolito was convicted of murder and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, DHS said. Diego Fernandez-Martinez, also from Mexico, had convictions for carjacking, vehicle theft, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance for sales, robbery and prisoner in possession of a weapon, according to DHS, which noted he was also a member of the Surenos gang.

Meanwhile, a ""worst of the worst"" Halloween weekend roundup included arrests of criminal illegal aliens convicted of intercourse with a minor, sexual abuse, kidnapping, homicide and other serious crimes. DHS highlighted that 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S., according to a statement to Fox News Digital.

With multiple important statewide elections in Virginia looming, Fox News Digital reached out to Virginia candidates for governor and attorney general, including Democrat gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, Democrat Attorney General candidate Jay Jones and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, for comment on these recent arrests.

""Disobedience of the law has no place in Virginia. Attorney General Miyares has proven time and again that violent offenders, including those in our country illegally, will face swift and uncompromising justice when they harm innocent Virginians,"" representatives for Miyares said. ""Jay Jones, on the other hand, would take our Commonwealth in the opposite direction. He intends to turn Virginia into a sanctuary state, tying the hands of law enforcement and endangering every law-abiding Virginian.""

We’re going to kill them.” Trump administration officials are also purposefully withholding information from lawmakers.
Last week, in a separate briefing, the administration excluded Democrats in a briefing with Senate Republicans on the strikes.","As the Trump administration blows past a key congressional deadline, a top lawyer in the Department of Justice has claimed that the executive branch does not need the approval of Congress to continue conducting boat strikes in and around the Caribbean — an assertion outside experts say is patently false.

Last week, Office of Legal Counsel T. Elliot Gaiser told a small group of members of Congress that the administration does not have to follow the 1973 War Powers Resolution and its mandate that Congress must approve of armed conflict conducted by the U.S.

The briefing was made just before the end of the 60-day deadline established by the legislation. The legislation requires the president to acquire approval for sustained military action within 60 days of an initial notification of actions. This deadline passed on Monday. Gaiser said that the administration is not going to seek approval or an extension of the deadline.

In an email to The Washington Post, a senior official said that strikes do not rise to the level of “hostilities,” as defined under the law.

The administration’s reasoning, it seems, is that “even at its broadest … [it] has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service-members in harm’s way,” and that the current engagement does not do so — even as the administration claims that the current operation is conducted in self-defense.

“The operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,” the email said.

Experts say this reasoning is patently wrong. Brian Finucane, senior advisor for the International Crisis Group’s U.S. program, pointed out that Congress has previously noted that the resolution purposefully used a broader term — “hostilities” — rather than a narrower term — “armed conflict.” This was so that it could encompass not just attacks, but also a “clear and present danger of armed conflict.”

Further, last month, Trump explicitly said that the administration was engaged in “armed conflict” in its boat strike campaign.

“[F]or the administration to claim U.S. forces are in an armed conflict but not hostilities would be nonsensical to those members of Congress who passed the legislation,” Finucane wrote for Just Security.

Officials’ assertion of control over war powers is a show of how the Trump administration seems to be shifting its legal reasoning on the fly to continue its strikes. Trump, for his part, appears unconcerned with legal reasoning, simply saying last month: “I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, okay? We’re going to kill them.”

Trump administration officials are also purposefully withholding information from lawmakers. Last week, in a separate briefing, the administration excluded Democrats in a briefing with Senate Republicans on the strikes. And in briefings so far, lawmakers say the Pentagon has not provided lists of which gangs they’re targeting or the identities of those killed.

In fact, Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told The New Republic that the administration said they are targeting anyone “affiliated” with “narco-terrorist” groups — and that the administration won’t even explain what constitutes an “affiliation.”

“They did not in any way, shape, manner, or form explain what the ceiling and floor are for ‘affiliated,’” Smith said. Smith added that the administration’s treatment of survivors of the strikes — all of whom so far have been repatriated to their home countries — underscores the illegality of the operations.

Smith says he told administration officials: “So what you’re telling us is you need less evidence to kill somebody than you do to hold them.”

Meanwhile, the operation is seemingly constantly on the verge of expanding into a ground war. Last week, Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. is prepared to strike ground targets within Venezuela.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_11-4-trump-air-force-one.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:15.282327

Security forces have arrested three prominent scholars — Parviz Sedaghat, Mahsa Asadollazadeh, and Shirin Karimi — while summoning and interrogating economic researcher Mohammad Maljoo. The arrests of these independent voices in the social sciences and humanities who are known for their critical, left-leaning perspectives on Iran’s political and economic structures appears to mark a new, concerning violation of freedom of speech and thought.

The situation of the four citizens remains unclear, as neither Iran’s security nor judicial authorities have issued any official statements regarding their detention. The absence of information about the arresting authority, reasons, or charges has deepened fears among Iran’s academic and human-rights communities about their safety and due process.

According to reports, security agents raided the homes of these individuals, confiscating electronic devices, books, and research materials. The simultaneous arrests and summons indicate what appears to be a coordinated operation targeting researchers known for their critical and independent scholarship.

Parviz Sedaghat, a 63-year-old economist and political-economy researcher, has been an influential figure in Iranian intellectual life. He has collaborated with several economic publications, written extensively on inequality and neoliberalism in Iran, and published numerous translations and critical essays on global political economy. Known for his left-oriented analyses of capitalism and state policy, Sedaghat was arrested at his home on Sunday evening after security officers searched the premises and seized his belongings.

Mahsa Asadollazadeh, 35, is a sociologist and graduate of Tarbiat Modares University. Recognized for her independent research in political sociology and contributions to the website Political Economic Critique (Naqd-e Eqtesad-e Siasi), she was arrested on Monday at her parents’ residence in Tehran. Witnesses report that security officers entered without explanation and confiscated her personal and academic equipment. Her work often engages with critical social theory and explores power relations within Iran’s social structure.

Shirin Karimi, 42, is a translator and sociologist with a degree from the University of Tehran. She has authored and translated numerous works in sociology and philosophy, contributing to Iran’s critical academic literature. She was detained early Monday morning following a search of her home, during which agents seized her books and communication devices. As of now, her place of detention remains unknown.

Mohammad Maljoo, 53, an economist with a PhD from the University of Tehran, was summoned for questioning and had his personal devices confiscated. Maljoo, who has taught both in Iran and abroad, is recognized for his critical studies on Iran’s post-revolutionary economic history and his progressive economic viewpoints. Though not officially detained, his interrogation and confiscation of materials suggest that the crackdown extends beyond formal arrests.

The Islamic Students’ Association of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Tehran issued a public statement on November 4, condemning what it called the “arrest and intimidation of independent researchers.” The statement declared that “at a time when the country is collapsing under successive political, economic, social, and cultural crises — crises the ruling institutions cannot or will not acknowledge — the government has once again resorted to the outdated tool of repression instead of accountability.”

These arrests occur amid a wider pattern of pressure against writers, journalists, and activists across the country. In recent weeks, similar actions have been reported not only in Tehran but also in Kurdistan, Kerman, and Isfahan Provinces, where teachers and labor organizers have been harassed or detained. Security agents recently searched the home of journalist Marzieh Rasouli, producer of the Radio Marz podcast, and confiscated her electronic devices.

Meanwhile, editors of the Tehran-based daily Ham-Mihan reported that security agencies shut down the newspaper’s website and ordered its staff to refrain from posting on social media. The paper’s publisher, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, publicly denounced ongoing pressure from the IRGC Intelligence Organization and the Ministry of Intelligence, warning of the shrinking space for free expression in the country.

Ahmad Zeidabadi, a journalist writing for Ham-Mihan, noted: “The website of Ham-Mihan newspaper has been blocked since last week without any legal notice, and the paper is now published only in limited printed copies. The survival of modern newspapers depends on their online platforms, and blocking a paper’s website is effectively no different from shutting down its publication altogether.”

The arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, and confiscation of personal and research materials constitute clear violations of international human-rights standards, including Articles 9 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a party. These actions undermine freedom of expression, academic freedom, and the right to security and fair trial. Human-rights observers warn that such detentions are intended to intimidate intellectuals, silence critical inquiry, and dismantle Iran’s independent academic community. The lack of transparency and denial of legal counsel reflect a systematic pattern of repression that extends beyond individual cases.

The arrests of Sedaghat, Asadollazadeh, and Karimi represent an alarming continuation of Iran’s pattern of seeking to silence independent voices. NIAC strongly condemns the detention of these scholars and all political prisoners held for peacefully exercising their rights to free expression, association, and academic inquiry. NIAC urges the Iranian government to move in line with its international rights obligations, including by immediately releasing Parviz Sedaghat, Mahsa Asadollazadeh, Shirin Karimi, and all prisoners unjustly detained in Iran.",https://niacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/niac-new-favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:26.699547

In their letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the Senators raised concerns with the “near-total secrecy” under which IAO operates in light of a series of troubling immigration enforcement actions that this Administration has taken – pointing to examples and credible reports of violations of detainees’ rights and inhumane treatment while in ICE custody. They pressed Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons for responses to a series of questions in the interest of providing much-needed transparency for Congress and the American public on these issues, including around the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

“We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations,” the Senators began.

“IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration,” they wrote, pointing to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process. “These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers,” they continued. “The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.”

“Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” they added. “A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. […] Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” they concluded, going on to list a series of questions for response by Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons regarding the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

The letter was led by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and signed by Blumenthal and Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

Context: For years, the Broadview facility has served as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility designed to hold people for fewer than 12 hours.

But in June, DHS officials quietly expanded permissions to 72 hours despite the lack of beds, showers, private bathrooms or medical care.

What they're saying: The hearing featured hours of testimony by former detainees who described cold, crowded, dirty rooms filled with more than 100 people, hard chairs, overflowing toilets, lights on 24 hours a day, sick people and foil blankets on the floor.

Two detainees testified they were kept there for five days.

The other side: Government lawyers admitted to the lack of beds, working showers, private toilets, medical care and private legal communication.

But they said they've started distributing baby wipes and detaining people for shorter periods before moving them to correctional facilities where they can more easily communicate with lawyers.

Plaintiff attorney Alexa Van Brunt said the temporary restraining order her clients are requesting is ""meant to improve things for a short amount of time so people are not suffering as they have been for months and so that people are not forced to sign things that waive their rights for the rest of their life.""

Federal government attorneys argued against the proposed TRO.

Key moments: Government lawyers described non-working showers at Broadview, and Judge Robert Gettleman said, ""One is reminded of Auschwitz when one thinks about that.""

""The fact that people are being kept overnight under not just one but multiple conditions that are unnecessarily cruel, if you wanna put a word on it, sleeping shoulder to shoulder next to filthy toilets that are overflowing surrounded by human waste is unacceptable,"" Gettleman said in closing.

Attorneys quibbled about whether detainee meals come from Subway or Jimmy John's. A consensus emerged around small, cold Subway sandwiches.

In Washington County, the Board of Commissioners declared a state of emergency Tuesday to allocate additional funds for immigration-related services. Leaders in neighboring Yamhill County said they’re also seeing an increase in enforcement activity.

A Newberg resident recorded video Sunday of what appeared to be federal agents arresting a man at a downtown laundromat. County officials said witnesses also reported seeing agents detain another person across the street at a Thriftway grocery store.

“From shopping to schools, I know church was closed this weekend because of ICE activity,” said Yamhill County Commissioner Bubba King.

King said people in the community are frightened and staying home.

“It’s no way for kids or families to have to live — in fear,” he said.

A local farmworker said he was heading to the laundromat when he got word that ICE agents were nearby.

“It feels bad because you can’t go out shopping. You can’t do a lot. Can’t go out at ease. So, there’s fear,” he said.

Another resident shared video of a suspected ICE vehicle downtown, just blocks from Newberg City Council President Elise Yarnell Hollamon’s home.

“These are my neighbors. They are people that my kid goes to school with their kids,” Yarnell Hollamon said. “I have a lot of concern about how to have those conversations with our kids and our neighborhood.”

The Trump administration has said its immigration crackdown is meant to improve community safety. But some local leaders and advocates argue the visible arrests are creating widespread fear and disrupting families and businesses.

“Immigrants are workers but also small business owners and consumers,” said Miriam Vargas Corona, executive director of Unidos Bridging Community. “Every time someone is taken, it creates a ripple effect in our local economy.”

King said he’s frustrated by what he sees as a lack of compassion for longtime residents.

“These people have lived here 20 to 30 years,” King said. “There’s a due process and human rights aspect that’s being overlooked.

On October 31, the Department of Education issues a new rule that disqualifies employers from the PSLF program if the Department deems them to have a “substantial illegal purpose.” Under the rule, the Department will decide for itself whether this standard is met, based on its unilateral determination that an organization has engaged in activities disfavored by the administration concerning immigration, gender affirming care, and purported discrimination, along with other areas. The rule’s vague and overbroad language permits arbitrary enforcement against mission-driven organizations doing work or expressing opinions opposed by the government. The new rule threatens to harm many of the 2.5 million federal student loan borrowers who have collectively worked more than 100 million months in public service jobs in order to qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

Public Citizen, representing Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the American Immigration Council, The Door – A Center of Alternatives, Inc., and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and co-counseling with Student Defense, filed suit to challenge the rule. The lawsuit asks the court to declare the new rule unlawful and to declare that the Department lacks the legal authority to change the statutory criteria for PSLF.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 21:16:52.619374

The Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration serves as an important tool to inform Parliament and Canadians about key admission highlights and data on immigration in Canada. Its tabling in Parliament is mandated by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). This year, the Annual Report places renewed focus on the reporting requirements outlined in section 94 of IRPA. Reflecting this focus, the Report has been restructured to spotlight key data tables, year-over-year comparisons, and metrics central to immigration planning and accountability.

In addition to the Annual Report, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) also produces the Departmental Results Report (DRR). The DRR provides parliamentarians and Canadians with information on the Department’s performance against the expected results outlined in the Departmental Results Framework and Departmental Plan. It follows the structure of IRCC’s Core Responsibilities, as approved by the Treasury Board Secretariat. The DRR includes broader data and insights than those found in the Annual Report.

Please note that the DRR and the Annual Report may be tabled at separate times. If the Annual Report is published first, there may be a period during which the most recent DRR is not yet available.

About the Data in this Report

Admissions dataFootnote 1 are presented in Tables 1 through 4, as well as on the Government of Canada’s Open Government Portal.

In accordance with the Privacy Act, IRCC has implemented data rounding practices to help protect an individual’s privacy when publishing statistical data. This process includes masking small counts between 1 and 5, and randomly rounding other numerical data, including totals, up or down to a specified multiple (e.g., 5 or 10). These measures help prevent the identification of individuals in the data while maintaining overall data integrity.

IRCC continues to implement the 2021 Sex and Gender Client Identifier Policy, which enables individuals who do not identify as female or male to select “Another Gender – X” as their gender identifier on official documents such as passports, travel documents, citizenship certificates, and permanent resident cards. The “X” designation aligns with international standards for travel document specifications and remains the only alternative to “F” and “M” for the mandatory sex field in travel documents. IRCC is working to ensure consistent application of the policy across all program lines, including the collection, recording, and display of sex and gender information. As implementation continues, it is important to note that the term “unspecified”, which was used prior to the adoption of “Another Gender – X”, may still appear in some records as “recorded in the system.” This legacy designation is maintained separately from “X”.

Processing times for immigration applications are published and updated monthly on IRCC’s website. Readers are directed to the following link for the most up-to-date information: Check current IRCC processing times.

Immigration to Help Meet Canada’s Needs

Immigration has profoundly shaped Canada’s economic, social, and cultural fabric. First Nations and Inuit have lived on these lands since time immemorial. The French, English, and Métis Nations played foundational roles in shaping the early identity and institutions of the country. Since then, generations of immigrants have helped build a more inclusive, prosperous, and forward-looking Canada, one that continues to see diversity as a source of strength.

First generation immigrantsFootnote 2 comprised 23% of the population in 2021.Footnote 3 Data published by Statistics Canada indicates that as of January 1, 2025, the Canadian population reached 41,528,680.Footnote 4 In 2024, Statistics Canada estimated that Canada’s population grew by 744,324 people, a growth rate of 1.8% which is lower than in 2022 or 2023 and may reflect a transition back to rates more in line with the pre-pandemic period. Notably, international migration accounted for 97.3% of this growth. While Canada experienced a modest natural increase, with an estimated 19,738 more birthsFootnote 5 than deaths over the year, this alone would have resulted in only minimal growth. Immigration remains the primary driver of Canada’s population expansion.

Moving forward, Canada’s immigration policies will continue to focus on attracting, retaining and successfully integrating immigrants who are needed to help provide services, build infrastructure and support Canada’s economy. Immigration policies will also seek to balance Canada’s economic objectives with our family reunification, humanitarian and refugee commitments.

With growth comes the responsibility to ensure that those who choose Canada as their destination, and those who are already here, have access to the infrastructure, resources, and services necessary to build and sustain their lives.

Permanent Immigration to Canada

Foreign nationals can immigrate to Canada permanently through a variety of pathways and programs. These permanent resident programs grant individuals the right to live, work or study anywhere in the country. If they meet the requirements, permanent residents can also apply for, and be granted, Canadian citizenship.

IRCC facilitates the entry of permanent residents in a way that maximizes their economic, social, and cultural contributions to Canada, while also safeguarding the health, safety and security of all Canadians.

In 2024, 483,640 immigrants were admitted as permanent residents, in line with targets set out in the Government of Canada’s Immigration Levels Plan. Of these, 244,965 identified as women, 238,650 as men, and 30 as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 471,808 immigrants were admitted as permanent residents, which indicates a 2.5% increase from 2023 to 2024.

The following table provides the number of foreign nationals who became permanent residents, including those admitted under federal-provincial-territorial agreements.

Economic Immigration

Canada has various immigration programs to attract talented people and to spread benefits to communities across the country. Economic programs select skilled workers and entrepreneurs for their ability to contribute to the Canadian economy. The economic immigration class is the largest source of permanent resident admissions, accounting for 58.2% of all admissions in 2024. In 2024, 281,615 principal applicants and their spouses and/or dependents were admitted to Canada under Economic Immigration categories. Of these, 134,155 identified as women, 147,455 identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 272,744 individuals were admitted to Canada under the Economic Class reflecting a 3.3% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Express Entry

Express Entry is Canada’s application management system for the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, Canadian Experience Class, and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Program. Express Entry manages the intake of applications for permanent residence under key economic immigration programs, while facilitating the selection of individuals most likely to succeed economically. An additional tool within Express Entry is Category-Based Selection (CBS), which enables the Minister to establish categories to meet an identified economic goal and invite top-ranked candidates, who are eligible for the category, to apply for permanent residence. In 2024, candidates with experience in occupations eligible under the following categories were invited to apply for permanent residence through CBS rounds: French-language proficiency, Healthcare, Education, Trades, Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations, Transport and Agriculture and Agri-food. In 2024, a total of 19 CBS rounds were conducted.

In 2024, Canada admitted a total of 134,980Footnote 20 individuals through Express Entry, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants on these programs. Of these, 63,890 identified as women, 71,085 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

Federal Business Class

The Federal Business Class attracts highly-skilled talent to support Canada’s strategic economic growth. The Class comprises the Start-Up Visa (SUV) program, which is designed to attract early-stage, high-growth companies that create jobs, and the Self-employed persons program, which selects exceptional individuals in the arts or athletics who will help strengthen Canada’s cultural fabric. In 2024, Canada welcomed a total of 7,635 individuals through these programs, including principal applicants and their accompanying family members. Of these, 3,670 identified as women, 3,965 identified as men, and a small proportion of the remaining applicants identified as another gender.Footnote 21

Regional Economic Immigration Programs and Pilots

Regional economic immigration programs, namely the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP), Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP), and the Rural and Francophone Community Immigration Pilots (RCIP/FCIP) are place-based strategies designed to respond to diverse and evolving regional labour market needs, drive population growth outside major urban centres, and promote long-term integration and retention. These programs collectively accounted for 45% of economic immigration admissions in 2024.Footnote 22 While not included in this percentage, francophone immigration also plays a key role in supporting regional vitality and economic development, particularly in Francophone Minority Communities outside Quebec, through broader commitments to linguistic diversity and demographic renewal.

Regional programs are designed to allow delivery partners (i.e. provinces, territories, and communities) to select immigrants with the skills and experience needed to fill critical labour needs and better respond to regional realities.

In 2024, Canada admitted a total of 114,905 individuals through the PNP and 8,055 through the AIP, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants. Of those admitted through the PNP, 53,730 were women, and 61,175 were men. For the AIP, 3,825 identified as women, and 4,230 as men. A small number of individuals in both programs identified as another gender.

The RNIP admitted a total of 4,070 permanent residents, in 2024, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants, to one of eleven rural and remote communities across Canada. Of these, 1,895 identified as women, and 2,175 as men. The RNIP sunset in 2024 after five years and was replaced by the RCIP and the FCIP.

Sectoral Economic Immigration Pilot Programs

Economic immigration pilot programs test innovative approaches to help support specific economic objectives and labour market needs across Canada.

Under the Caregiver category, the Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker pilots, which received applications between June 18, 2019 to June 17, 2024, provided clear and direct pathways to permanent residence for workers who helped to meet the home care needs of Canada’s seniors, children and people with disabilities.

In 2024, 6,095 permanent residents and their spouses and dependants were admitted through the Caregiver category.Footnote 23 Of these, 3,685 identified as women, and 2,410 identified as men.

The five-year Agri-Food Pilot program (AFP), which expired on May 14, 2025, tested an industry-specific approach to immigration to help address longstanding labour needs in the Canadian agri-food sector. It provided a pathway to permanent residence for experienced, non-seasonal workers in year-round occupations in the mushroom and greenhouse crop production, meat processing, and livestock raising industries. In 2024, a total of 1,840 individuals (including principal applicants and their dependants) were admitted as permanent residents through the five-year AFP. Of these, 865 identified as women, and 980 identified as men.

Family Reunification

Family reunification remains a cornerstone of Canada’s immigration system. Canada remains committed to helping Canadian citizens and permanent residents sponsor eligible relatives to become permanent residents themselves. This commitment not only strengthens family bonds but also contributes to the economic, social, and cultural vitality of communities across the country. Sponsors agree to assume financial responsibility for the sponsored individual for a specified period, ensuring a smooth transition and integration into Canadian society.

In 2024, 105,990 individuals were admitted under the Family Reunification Category – this includes sponsored spouses, partners, dependent children and sponsored parents and grandparents as well as other sponsored family members. Of these, 64,170 identified as women, 41,810 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 109,730 individuals were admitted under the Family Reunification Category representing a 3.4% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Sponsored Spouses, Partners, and Dependent Children

In 2024, 78,655 individuals were admitted under the sponsored spouses, partners and children category. Of these, 47,775 identified as women, 30,870 as men, and 10 identified as another gender.Footnote 24

In 2023, a total of 81,417 individuals were admitted under this category marking a 3.4% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Sponsored Parents and Grandparents

In 2024, 27,330 individuals were admitted under the Sponsored Parents and Grandparents category. Of these, 16,395 identified as women, and 10,940 as men.

In 2023, a total of 28,313 individuals were admitted under this category, representing a 3.5% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Super Visa

Parents or grandparents may also apply for the super visa, a multi-entry temporary resident visa that allows them to reunite with their Canadian citizen, permanent resident, and registered IndianFootnote 25 family members in Canada for up to five years per entry. While in Canada, they may also apply for extensions of up to two additional years.

In 2024, the Department approved 53,695 super visas applications. Of these, 33,040 were issued to individuals identifying as women and 20,655 to those identifying as men.

In 2023, a total of 73,113 super visas applications were approved, representing a 26.6% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other

The following section presents the number of individuals granted permanent resident status on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate grounds or public policy considerations.

Permanent residency may be granted on a case-by-case basis under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, or through public policy considerations in exceptional circumstances. These admissions comprise all Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other admissions, along with the Permit Holder Class.

In 2024, a total of 19,355 individuals were admitted under this category. Of these, 10,200 identified as women, and 9,150 as men and a small proportion identified as another gender. Admissions under this pathway exceeded planned range due to urgent public policy responses to global crises, including the humanitarian permanent residence pathway for up to 11,000 Colombian, Haitian, and Venezuelan nationals with family ties in Canada. Despite this higher volume overall permanent resident admissions remained within the planned range.

In 2023, a total of 14,355 individuals were admitted to Canada under the Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other category, representing a 34.8% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Refugees and Protected Persons

In 2024, a total of 76,685 refugees and protected persons were admitted as permanent residents. Of these, 36,440 identified as women, 40,230 as men, and 15 as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 74,979 refugees and protected persons were admitted as permanent residents, reflecting a 2.3% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Resettled Refugees

Each year, IRCC facilitates the admission of a targeted number of permanent residents under the refugee resettlement category. The Department provides protection to Convention Refugees, individuals who are outside of their home country and unable to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion and to those who are in need of resettlement as a result of being seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights.

Additionally, the Department funds service providers to offer tailored resettlement assistance to Government-Assisted Refugees and other eligible individuals in order to meet their immediate and essential needs upon arrival in Canada. This includes the provision of temporary housing, supports to help secure permanent housing, immediate and essential orientation, as well as providing links and referrals to other services and programs. Through the National Call for Proposals 2024 process, IRCC will continue to support eligible clients through the Resettlement Assistance Program.

The Resettlement Program also continues to deliver a number of distinct pathways and programs for vulnerable people, including religious and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ individuals, human rights defenders, as well as women and children in precarious situations.

In 2024, a total of 49,285 resettled refugees were admitted as permanent residents. Of these, 22,915 identified as women 26,370 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

Of the total number of resettled refuges admitted:

19,485 were Government-Assisted Refugees

29,715 were Privately Sponsored Refugees

85 were admitted through the Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) program, which allows sponsorship groups and government to jointly support resettled refugees identified by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR)

In 2023, a total of 51,081 resettled refugees were admitted as permanent residents, representing a 3.5% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Protected Persons in-Canada

Protected Persons in-Canada (PPIC) may apply for permanent residence and may include their dependents, whether in Canada or abroad. PPIC includes Convention refugees, individuals recognized by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) as persons in need of protection, individuals with positive pre-removal risk assessments, and protected temporary residents.

In 2024, a total of 27,400 individuals obtained permanent residence under the PPIC category. Of these, 13,525 identified as women, 13,865 as men, and a small proportion as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 23,898 individuals obtained permanent residence under this category, representing a 14.7% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Asylum Claims

The In-Canada Asylum System is responsible for receiving and registering asylum claims made within Canada, assessing eligibility for referral to the IRB, conducting security screenings, providing protection to those deemed in need at or within Canada’s borders, and removing individuals who do not qualify for Canada’s protection.

In 2024, Canada received 171,840 asylum claims at various ports of entry and inland offices.

Francophone Immigration Outside Quebec

In 2024, IRCC advanced several key initiatives, including the Francophone Minority Communities Student Pilot, the Francophone Community Immigration Pilot, and the expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities Initiative to 10 additional communities across Canada.

Through its Francophone Immigration Support Program, IRCC also funded nine projects totalling approximately $8,9M. This program engages Francophone communities by funding innovative approaches to address barriers and increase the recruitment, selection and retention of Francophone immigrants.

Admissions Targets for French-Speaking Permanent Residents Outside Quebec

In 2024, IRCC launched its Policy on Francophone Immigration, providing long-term strategic direction to support the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. IRCC surpassed its 6% of overall admissions target for French-speaking permanent resident admissions outside Quebec, reaching 7.2% in 2024. In total, 30,550 French-speaking permanent residents were admitted to Canada outside of Quebec in 2024.

Categories of French-Speaking Permanent Residents Outside Quebec Admitted

In 2024, French-speaking permanent residents outside Quebec were admitted through all major immigration categories, with the majority entering via the Economic class.

Economic Class: 25,195

Sponsored by family: 1,680

Resettled refugees and protected persons in-Canada and dependants abroad: 1,530

Other immigrants: 2,145

Temporary Resident Programs and Volumes

A temporary resident is a foreign national who is legally authorized to enter Canada for a limited period. Temporary resident status is granted when an individual meets the legislative requirements to enter or remain in Canada as a visitor, student, worker, or holder of a temporary resident permit.

A total of 1.6 million temporary residents were issued permits in 2024; including study permits, work permits,Footnote 26 and temporary resident permits. Of these, approximately 687,000 were new arrivals to Canada as work or study permit holders.Footnote 27 Over the course of the year, 3 million individuals held valid permits to enter or remain in Canada as temporary residents. This figure includes those whose permits became effective in 2024, whether they were initial permits or renewals, as well as foreign nationals that were in Canada with valid status throughout the year. This figure accounts for the fact that individuals may hold more than one type of permit in a year.Footnote 28

International students

IRCC facilitates the entry of students who wish to study at a designated Canadian educational institution. Students approved to study in Canada are issued a study permit.

In 2024, 516,275 individuals held study permits in Canada. This included new permits and extensions. Of these, 242,970 identified as women, 273,235 as men, 55 as another gender and the gender of 10 individuals was recorded as unspecified. An intake cap on study permit applications was introduced in January 2024 to help manage unsustainable growth in the program, with an issuance target set at 485,000 for that year. Of the 516,275 study permit holders, only 293,835 were issued to new students entering Canada in 2024, with the balance being issued to students already in Canada. This means that there were less than 360,000 new study permit holders who entered Canada in 2024.

In 2023, a total of 682,889 individuals held study permits, of which 496,175 were new. This indicates a decrease of 24% from 2023 to 2024. Canada’s overall international student population declined by 4% at year end of 2024 compared to end of 2023.

Student to Permanent Resident Transition

In 2024, 25,580 study permit holders were granted permanent residency compared to 25,605 study permit holders in 2023, which is a decrease of 0.1% from 2023 to 2024.Footnote 29 Of these, 13,045 identified as women, 12,525 as men, and the remainder identified as another gender.

Temporary Foreign Workers

Foreign nationals seeking to undertake temporary work in Canada may be authorized to work without a permit, or receive a work permit under one of Canada’s work permit programs under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Through its management of the International Mobility Program (IMP) and its joint administration of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) with Employment and Social Development Canada, IRCC supports the effective and responsible entry of temporary foreign workers into the Canadian labour market when a work permit is required. The TFWP requires a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire a temporary worker, in order to ensure that qualified Canadians or permanent residents are not available, whereas the IMP allows employers to hire a temporary worker without an LMIA, based on the broader economic, cultural, or other competitive advantages for Canada and reciprocal benefits enjoyed by Canadians and permanent residents.

In 2024, a total of 905,440Footnote 30 individuals began working in Canada on new work permits, down from 946,259 in 2023, representing a 4.3% decrease.

This total includes work permits under both the TFW and the IMP.

In 2024, there were 191,630 individuals with new work permits under the TFWP. Of these, 41,060 identified as women, 150,565 as men, and a small number either identified as another gender or had their gender recorded as unspecified.

In the same year, there were 717,405 individuals with new work permits under the IMP. Of these, 344,470 identified as women, 372,845 as men, 50 as another gender, and the gender of 35 individuals was recorded as unspecified.

Together, the TFWP and IMP figures account for the entire population of work permit holders whose permits became effective in 2024.

The Department administers the Open Work Permit for Vulnerable Workers (OWP-V), which provides temporary foreign workers on valid employer-specific work permits access to an open work permit, if they are experiencing, or are at risk of experiencing, abuse in their job.

Temporary to Permanent Resident Transition

In 2024, the Department granted permanent residency to 160,100 individuals holding temporary work permits. Of these, 74,170 identified as women, 85,925 as men, and the remainder identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 156,580 temporary work permit holders were granted permanent residency, which indicates an 2.3% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Visitors

IRCC facilitates the entry of visitors who wish to stay in Canada temporarily, while safeguarding the health, safety and security of Canadians.Footnote 31 Depending on factors such as the visitor’s nationality, travel document, and method of travel, they may require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter Canada. IRCC processes TRVs and eTAs for visitors such as tourists, those seeking to visit family, and business travellers. Visitors provide economic benefits to Canada and Canadians, including through direct economic revenue, but also by supporting Canadian businesses and Canadian jobs in cities across the country. Business visits to Canada by foreign nationals also contribute to growth in trade and investment opportunities.

In 2024, a total of 5,031,925 TRVs and eTAs were approved. Of these 2,522,730 individuals identified as women, 2,509,080 as men, 110 as another gender, and a small proportion had their gender recorded as unspecified.

In 2023, a total of 5,491,145 holders of TRV and eTA were approved, representing a 8.4% decrease in approvals from 2023 to 2024.

Temporary Resident Permits

Under subsection 24(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) may be issued to a foreign national who is inadmissible to Canada or otherwise does not meet the requirements of the Act. An officer may issue a TRP if the foreign national’s need to enter or remain in Canada temporarily is justified in the circumstances. These permits are issued for a limited duration and may be cancelled at any time. In 2024, a total of 6,740 TRPs were issued. Further information on entering Canada with a TRP in cases of inadmissibility is available on IRCC’s website.

Table 4: Temporary Resident Permits and Extensions Issued in 2024 by Grounds of Inadmissibility

The following table presents the number of TRPs issued in 2024, categorized by grounds of inadmissibility as defined under IRPA.

Source: IRCC, Consolidated Business Reporting as of April 24, 2025.

TRPs for Victims of Human Trafficking

As a protection measure, TRPs may be issued to out-of-status foreign nationals in Canada who are identified as victims of human trafficking. These permits provide temporary resident status and make recipients eligible for a work permit. In addition, permit holders have access to healthcare services through the Interim Federal Health Program.

In 2024, a total of 130 TRPs were issued to victims of human trafficking and their dependants. This figure is included in the overall number of TRPs reported in Table 4.

TRPs for Victims of Family Violence

Since 2019, out-of-status foreign nationals who are experiencing family violence from a spouse or common-law partner have been eligible to apply for a fee-exempt TRP. This measure is intended for individuals whose application for permanent residence depends on remaining in a genuine relationship that has become abusive. The TRP grants temporary legal status in Canada, enabling individuals to apply for an open work permit or study permit, and to safely leave an abusive relationship without risking their immigration status.

In 2024, a total of 285 TRPs were approved for victims of family violence and their dependents. These cases are processed separately from TRPs and are not included in the totals shown in Table 4.

Public Policy Exemptions for a Temporary Purpose

In 2024, a total of 95 applications for temporary residence received exemptions under the public policy that exempts certain foreign nationals from inadmissibility provisions for a temporary purpose. This public policy enables eligible individuals to enter Canada as visitors, students, or workers, despite otherwise being inadmissible under standard immigration criteria.

These cases are processed separately from TRPs and are not included in the totals shown in Table 4.

Use of the Negative Discretion Authority

Pursuant to section 22.1(4) of IRPA the Annual Report includes the number of declarations made by the Minister that a foreign national (other than a foreign national referred to in section 19) may not become a temporary resident. Making this declaration is referred to as the use of negative discretion authority. Negative discretion authority is used when the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations. Alongside the number of declarations made this report also includes the public policy considerations that led to the making of the declarations.

In 2024, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship did not use the negative discretion authority under subsection 22.1(1) of IRPA.

Settlement Program

IRCC’s Settlement Program funds services to help newcomers integrate into the Canadian labour market and society, and build a successful life in Canada. In the context of the Settlement Program, a newcomer refers to an individual who is in an initial period of adaptation and settlement in Canada. Settlement services are available only to those who are permanent residents (including protected persons and resettled refugees). The department continues to provide settlement services to certain temporary residents who are on a clear pathway to permanent residence or arriving under a departmental response to an international crisis.

In 2024, a total of 694,640 unique clients received settlement services. Among the 98% of clients for whom gender data was available, 385,260 identified as women (55%), 309,320 as men (45%), and 62 as another gender. Over the same period, the percentage of French-speaking newcomers served by Francophone service providers continued to rise: 69% in 2024, compared with 63% in 2023.

The National Call for Proposals (CFP) 2024 process prioritized high-quality service continuity for the most vulnerable newcomers through IRCC’s Settlement and Resettlement programs, and also reinforced the Department’s dedication to advancing anti-racism, Truth & Reconciliation, gender equality, and equity priorities by embedding Gender-based analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and equity considerations into funding and programming.

In 2024, the Settlement Program Website was updated to create a one-stop-shop where newcomers and Canadians can find information about Settlement and Resettlement Programs, including insights from the Department’s most recent data and reports. Updates were also made to the Find Free Newcomer Services Near You page which allows newcomers to search for services based on their location and the type of service(s) they are seeking.

GBA Plus Considerations in Immigration

The Department’s ongoing Anti-Racism and GBA Plus efforts aim to ensure that gender, diversity, and a broad range of identity factors are considered in the development and implementation of policies and programs.

Analysis of gender and diversity dataFootnote 34 highlight both areas of progress and ongoing variances in representation across several programs within the Temporary and Permanent Resident streams. Variations in admissions data and social outcomes may be associated with identity-related factors such as gender, country of citizenship, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, and others.

GBA Plus Considerations for Permanent Resident Programs

Overall PR admissions in 2024 included 49.4% individuals identifying as men, 50.7% as women and less than 1% as another gender. Some programs show greater variation in gender representation than others. Gender representation differs across programs due to a number of complex factors. For the four immigration categories the gender breakdown for program admissions in 2024 is as follows:

Federal EconomicFootnote 35: 47.6% identified as women, and 52.4% identified as men, including a small proportion that identified as another gender

Sponsored FamilyFootnote 36: 60.5% identified as women, and 39.4% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Refugee and Protected Persons in-Canada: 47.5% identified as women, and 52.5% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Humanitarian and Other: 52.7% identified as women, and 47.3% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Table 5: Top 5 Source Countries of Citizenship for Permanent Resident Programs

GBA Plus Considerations for Temporary Resident Programs

In 2024, gender representation within the TR stream varies. Overall:

Study Permits: 47.1% identified as women, 52.9% identified as men and a small proportion identified as another gender

Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program: 21.4% identified as women, 78.6% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

International Mobility Program (IMP): 48% identified as women, 52% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Visitors: 50.1% identified as women, 49.9% identified as men and a small proportion identified as another gender

Across all Temporary Resident (TR) programs, the top five source countries consistently account for approximately 60% or more of total admissions (see table for details).

Advancing Equity in Canada’s Immigration System

In 2024, IRCC reviewed its Anti-Racism Strategy 2.0 (2021–2024) and assessed departmental progress to inform the development of its next Equity Strategy for 2025–2028.

To support more inclusive and consistent decision-making, IRCC has developed several tools and frameworks, including the Institutional Bias and Racism Identification Method, and the Renewed Risk Management Framework. These initiatives aim to strengthen the department’s capacity to identify and mitigate potential sources of bias in program delivery and risk assessment.

Monitoring and Evaluating Equity

IRCC has implemented programs to assess the outcomes of its services and policies across diverse client groups. This includes the use of disaggregated data by gender, age, country of origin. The new IRCC Data Strategy (2023–2026) builds on existing commitments to responsible data management by further strengthening the use of reliable sources and strong privacy safeguards. Improvements in data usage and governance enables faster, more accurate insights that support equitable outcomes across programs.

IRCC also applies GBA Plus in its Algorithm Impact Assessments (AIAs), to ensure that advanced analytics, automation, and AI are implemented in a manner consistent with equity principles. As of December 2024, 21 AIAs have been completed, with 12 published and nine under internal review, contributing to service improvements and more accessible digital platforms for a broad range of clients.

Ministerial Instructions

Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) includes various provisions that allow the Minister to issue instructions to immigration officers, to enable the Government of Canada to best achieve its immigration goals. These instructions are typically issued for limited periods of time and can touch upon a diverse range of issues.

The table below provides a description and publication date of the 2024 Ministerial Instructions issued under paragraphs 24(3) and 10.3(1)(h.2) and section 87.3 of IRPA, as well as section 14.1 and subsections 30(1.2), 30(1.41), and 30(1.43), where applicable.

Table 7: Ministerial Instructions – 2024 Summary

Annex: Canada’s 2026–2028 Levels Plan

Throughout Canada’s history, we have welcomed people from around the world—those fleeing persecution, war and strife, those seeking to work hard and build a better life for their families, those seeking to study at our world-class universities, experts wanting to drive innovation in Canada. The fabric of our nation is woven with this tradition.

As we have welcomed the world, we had the promise that if someone came to Canada they would contribute to our prosperity, and in return they would get all Canada offered—a country that is generous, fair, and diverse.

Our immigration system was built to standardise and evaluate newcomers so that admission was based on a person’s merits. Over time, this system has evolved—its complexity has grown and its efficiency has waned. In recent years, the system became even harder to manage and less functional, and the pace of arrivals began to exceed Canada’s capacity to absorb and support newcomers in the way we are used to doing.

In 2018, 3.3 per cent of Canada’s population were temporary residents. By 2024, that number had more than doubled to 7.5 per cent, an unprecedented rate of growth that put pressure on housing supply, the healthcare system, and schools. Canada’s new government recognises that this system is no longer sustainable, and we are determined to make it so, for everyone who lives in and comes to this country.

We are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels—allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home. At the same time, Canada will continue its long tradition of welcoming those fleeing violence, persecution and displacement.

The results of the government’s focus are already becoming apparent. Asylum claims are down by a third, and new temporary foreign worker arrivals are down by approximately 50 per cent this year. New international student arrivals have also declined by approximately 60 per cent compared to 2024. This is a start, but we recognise there is more work to do.

Budget 2025 announces that the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will stabilise permanent resident admission targets at 380,000 per year for three years, down from 395,000 in 2025, while increasing the share of economic migrants from 59 per cent to 64 per cent. The new plan will also reduce the target for new temporary resident admissions from 673,650 in 2025 to 385,000 in 2026, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. The fiscal cost of this measure is $168.2 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, and $35.7 million ongoing. These costs primarily represent the net loss in fee revenue, driven by fewer temporary resident admissions.

The government recognises the role temporary foreign workers play in some sectors of the economy and in some parts of the country. To that end, the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will consider industries and sectors impacted by tariffs and the unique needs of rural and remote communities.

In addition, Budget 2025 proposes a one-time initiative to recognise eligible Protected Persons in Canada as permanent residents over the next two years. This practical step is a reflection of the fact that the vast majority of these people cannot return to the country of their origin. It will also ensure that those in genuine need of Canada’s protection have their permanent status recognized, accelerating their full integration into the Canadian society and their path to citizenship. The fiscal cost of this measure is $120.4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27. This represents the costs for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency to process the additional applications, which are partially offset by higher fee revenues.

Budget 2025 also proposes to undertake a one-time measure to accelerate the transition of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent residency in 2026 and 2027. These workers have established strong roots in their communities, are paying taxes, and are helping to build the strong economy Canada needs. The fiscal cost of this measure is $19.4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27. This also represents the costs for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and other departments to process the additional applications, which are partially offset by higher fee revenues.

These targets keep permanent resident arrivals at less than one per cent of the population beyond 2027 and will reduce the total number of temporary residents to less than five per cent of Canada’s population by the end of 2027.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Additional details on the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will be provided when the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship tables the 2025 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration.

A video investigation uncovering Israel’s role in the killing of a Palestinian American journalist. Another video revealing Israel’s destruction of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank.

YouTube surreptitiously deleted all these videos in early October by wiping the accounts that posted them from its website, along with their channels’ archives. The accounts belonged to three prominent Palestinian human rights groups: Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.

The move came in response to a U.S. government campaign to stifle accountability for alleged Israeli war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

The Palestinian groups’ YouTube channels hosted hours of footage documenting and highlighting alleged Israeli government violations of international law in both Gaza and the West Bank, including the killing of Palestinian civilians.

“I’m pretty shocked that YouTube is showing such a little backbone,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. “It’s really hard to imagine any serious argument that sharing information from these Palestinian human rights organizations would somehow violate sanctions. Succumbing to this arbitrary designation of these Palestinian organizations, to now censor them, is disappointing and pretty surprising.”

After the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants and charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Secretary Yoav Gallant with war crimes in Gaza, the Trump administration escalated its defense of Israel’s actions by sanctioning ICC officials and targeting people and organizations that work with the court.

“YouTube is furthering the Trump administration’s agenda to remove evidence of human rights violations and war crimes.”

“It is outrageous that YouTube is furthering the Trump administration’s agenda to remove evidence of human rights violations and war crimes from public view,” said Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. “Congress did not intend to allow the president to cut off the flow of information to the American public and the world — instead, information, including documents and videos, are specifically exempted under the statute that the president cited as his authority for issuing the ICC sanctions.”

“Alarming Setback”

YouTube, which is owned by Google, confirmed to The Intercept that it deleted the groups’ accounts as a direct result of State Department sanctions against the group after a review. The Trump administration leveled the sanctions against the organizations in September over their work with the International Criminal Court in cases charging Israeli officials of war crimes.

“Google is committed to compliance with applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws,” YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement.

According to Google’s Sanctions Compliance publisher policy, “Google publisher products are not eligible for any entities or individuals that are restricted under applicable trade sanctions and export compliance laws.”

Al Mezan, a human rights organization in Gaza, told The Intercept that its YouTube channel was abruptly terminated this year on October 7 without prior notification.

“Terminating the channel deprives us from reaching what we aspire to convey our message to, and fulfill our mission,” a spokesperson for the group said, “and prevents us from achieving our goals and limits our ability to reach the audience we aspire to share our message with.”

The West Bank-based Al-Haq’s channel was deleted on October 3, a spokesperson for the group said, with a message from YouTube that its “content violates our guidelines.”

“YouTube’s removal of a human rights organisation’s platform, carried out without prior warning, represents a serious failure of principle and an alarming setback for human rights and freedom of expression,” the Al-Haq spokesperson said in a statement. “The U.S. Sanctions are being used to cripple accountability work on Palestine and silence Palestinian voices and victims, and this has a ripple effect on such platforms also acting under such measures to further silence Palestinian voices.”

The Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which the U.N. describes as the oldest human rights organization in Gaza, said in a statement that YouTube’s move “protects perpetrators from accountability.”

“YouTube’s decision to close PCHR’s account is basically one of many consequences that we as an organisation have faced since the decision of the US government to sanction our organisations for our legitimate work,” said Basel al-Sourani, an international advocacy officer and legal advisor for the group. “YouTube said that we were not following their policy on Community Guidelines, when all our work was basically presenting factual and evidence-based reporting on the crimes committed against the Palestinian people especially since the start of the ongoing genocide on 7 October.”

“By doing this, YouTube is being complicit in silencing the voices of Palestinian victims,” al-Sourani added.

Looking Outside the U.S.

The three human rights groups’ account terminations cumulatively amount to the erasure of more than 700 videos, according to an Intercept tally.

The deleted videos range in scope from investigations, such as an analysis of the Israeli killing of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, to testimonies of Palestinians tortured by Israeli forces and documentaries like “The Beach,” about children playing on a beach who were killed by an Israeli strike.

Some videos are still available through copies saved on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine or on alternate platforms, such as Facebook and Vimeo. The wiping only affected the group’s official channels; videos which were produced by the nonprofits but hosted on alternate YouTube channels remain active. No cumulative index of videos deleted by YouTube is available, however, and many appear to not be available elsewhere online.

Videos posted elsewhere online, the groups fear, could soon be targeted for deletion because many of the platforms hosting them are also U.S.-based services. The ICC itself began exploring using service providers outside the U.S.

Al-Haq said it would also be looking for alternatives outside of U.S. companies to host their work.

YouTube isn’t the only U.S. tech company blocking Palestinian rights groups from using its services. The Al-Haq spokesperson said Mailchimp, the mailing list service, also deleted the group’s account in September. (Mailchimp and its parent company, Intuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Caving to Trump’s Demand

Both the U.S. and Israeli governments have long shielded themselves from the ICC and accountability for their alleged war crimes. Neither country is party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty that established the court.

In November 2024, the ICC prosecutors issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, charging the leaders with intentionally starving civilians by blocking aid from entering into Gaza. Both the Biden and Trump administrations rejected the legitimacy of the warrants.

Since his reelection, Trump has taken a more aggressive posture against accountability for Israel. In the early days of his second term, Trump renewed sanctions against the ICC and issued new, more severe measures against court officials and anyone accused of aiding their efforts. In September, in a new order, he specifically sanctioned the three Palestinian groups.

The U.S. moves followed Israel’s own designation of Al-Haq as a “terrorist organization” in 2021 and an online smear campaign by pro-Israeli activists attempting to link Palestinian Centre for Human Rights with militant groups.

The sanctions freeze the organizations’ assets in the U.S. and bar sanctioned individuals from traveling to the country. Federal judges have already issued preliminary injunctions in two cases in favor of plaintiffs who argued the sanctions had violated their First Amendment rights.

“The Trump administration is focused on contributing to the censorship of information about Israeli atrocities in Palestine and the sanctions against these organizations is very deliberately designed to make association with these organizations frightening to Americans who will be concerned about material support laws,” said Whitson, of DAWN, which joined a coalition of groups in September to demand the Trump administration drop its sanctions.

Like many tech firms, YouTube has shown a ready willingness to comply with demands from both the Trump administration and Israel. YouTube coordinated with a campaign organized by Israeli tech workers to remove social media content deemed critical of Israel. At home, Google, YouTube’s parent company, secretly handed over personal Gmail account information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an effort to detain a pro-Palestinian student organizer.

Even before Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza, YouTube had been accused of unevenly applying its community guidelines to censor Palestinian voices while withholding similar scrutiny from pro-Israeli content. Such trends continued during the war, according to a Wired report.

Earlier this year, YouTube shut down the official account of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. The move came after pressure from UK Lawyers for Israel, which wrote to YouTube to point out that the organization had been sanctioned by the State Department.

Whitson warned that YouTube’s capitulation could set a precedent, pushing other tech companies to bend to censorship.

“They are basically allowing the Trump administration to dictate what information they share with the global audience,” she said. “It’s not going to end with Palestine.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/YouTube-deletes-Pal-accounts.jpg?fit=2000%2C1000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-04 21:17:01.124264

Hobbs accused of ordering state police to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities

Governor’s Office claims no records exist to support Judicial Watch’s allegations

Issue brings up question of state and federal cooperation on immigration

Judicial Watch is suing Gov. Katie Hobbs, accusing her of ordering state police and National Guard to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities and then hiding that fact.

The national organization, which is known for filing public records lawsuits, contends that statements the governor made shortly after President Trump was elected in 2024 are tantamount to declaring she won’t use state resources to enforce his order for mass deportations. And that, the lawsuit says, runs afoul of a state law that bars public officials from restricting the enforcement of federal immigration laws, a position buttressed by a press release statement from Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch.

“Gov. Hobbs’ apparent refusal to allow state resources to support lawful immigration operations undermines the rule of law and places law enforcement and other innocent lives at risk,” he wrote.

The lawsuit, however, has no actual evidence that Hobbs issued any such order.

Instead, Judicial Watch is relying on a statement that the governor made to ABC News about a week after the 2024 election. And he is telling Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Frank Moskowitz that he should order her to produce any and all documents about her “official non-participation” in deportation activities.

That interview took place at the border where Hobbs had gone to publicize her own deployment of National Guard soldiers to help Customs and Border Protection. Those, she said, are the things she will do “that are most helpful in securing our border.”

“What I will unequivocally say is that as governor I will not tolerate efforts that are part of misguided policies that harm our communities, that threaten our communities, that terrorize our communities,” Hobbs said. “And Arizona will not take part in those.”

The governor also predicted at the time it would lead to “people hiding in fear,” similar to what happened when the Republican-controlled Legislature adopted SB 1070 in 2010, which was designed at least in part to require police to ask people they stop about their immigration status.

“It harmed communities, it tore families apart,” Hobbs said. “That’s not going to happen on my watch.”

The governor made similar comments days earlier at a press conference in Phoenix, saying she will “stand up against actions that hurt our communities.” But she dodged a question at that time of whether she would use her powers to prevent the wholesale deporting of those who entered the country illegally.

All that, Judicial Watch said in its news release about the lawsuit, is sufficient to question whether she ordered those two agencies to withhold cooperation from federal immigration authorities.

Gubernatorial press aide Christian Slater called the action “a shameless, politically motivated lawsuit by a far-right activist group.”

“The governor believes law enforcement should follow all applicable state laws around coordination with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” he said. “But state law enforcement will not participate in activities that harm our communities such as ICE going into churches, schools, hospitals, or going after people who have been here for decades, who follow the law, who otherwise follow the rules.”

Slater also said the governor’s office is unaware of any actual request by federal officials to actually coordinate with their deportation efforts, meaning there has never been an order from Hobbs to agencies telling them not to cooperate in those activities. The only direction Hobbs has given state agencies, he said, is to follow state laws.

The records request, sent Dec. 17, 2024, demands any documents about orders, directives or even suggestions to DPS that reflect “your official non-participation position” as reported.

It also seeks documents that reflect policies that would violate a state law stating that no official or agency of state or local government “may limit or restrict the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.”

That statute actually was part of SB 1070. While much of that law was voided by the U.S. Supreme Court, that section was never challenged and remains on the books.

Michael Bekesa, a senior attorney for Judicial Watch, told Capitol Media Services that he finally got a response of sorts from the governor’s office within hours of the lawsuit being filed last week.

“They sent us a letter that said, ‘We did a search, we have no records that are responsive to your request, but here’s seven pages of records that you may find interesting but aren’t responsive,”’ he said. And that, Bekesa said, took nine months.

But why does he believe there actually are some records directing agencies not to cooperate?

“She told the media they were going to not help with the federal government’s enforcement of immigration laws,” Bekesa responded. “How can the governor say they won’t do something without ordering her people not to do it?”

He conceded, though it “is possible” that Hobbs never received a request from the federal government to have DPS and National Guard actually enforce immigration laws. And that would mean there would be no directive to either agency to refuse — and no documents to produce.

“All we’re wondering is if she’s taken any proactive steps,” Bekesa said. “We think it’s a fair question.”

And then there was the nine-month delay.

“The burden is on the governor’s office to prove that they conducted an adequate search and then let us know that,” he said. “If they want to provide us a declaration, something under oath that says, ‘This is the search we did, we have no records,’ then, yes, we’d be reasonable and the case would be over.”

That, said Slater, is the case.

“There are no responsive records because the governor’s office has directed DPS to follow the law,” he said, repeating that Hobbs never issued any order that refused to work with ICE on deportations.

But there is a policy of sorts.

“Unless a state crime has been committed that falls under the jurisdiction of DPS, our personnel … do not conduct direct immigration enforcement,” Jeffrey Glover, director of the agency, said in June. He said if a state crime is committed and someone’s immigration status “becomes relevant,” officers may notify federal agencies “in accordance with existing laws and protocols.”

Judicial Watch bills itself as a “conservative, non-partisan educational foundation” that uses public records requests to investigate misconduct by government officials and files lawsuits “to hold to account politicians and public officials who engage in corrupt activities.”

Its recent lawsuits include one seeking records from the Department of Justice about decisions under the Biden administration to charge more people in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, another seeking records from federal agencies for spying on a Trump adviser, and documents related to the FBI investigation of Trump when he was a presidential candidate.

But it also has sued the CIA for records on what role convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein played with that agency.

What we know:

Two East Bay members of congress said there is increased ICE activity in their districts and that will impact some people's ability to participate in the essence of democracy.

""Nobody asked for this. We were promised they'd target the most violent, undocumented immigrants in our community,"" an angry Rep. Eric Swawell, (D) CA-14, said Monday afternoon in front of the Dublin Civic Center.

What has followed, according to Swalwell, is chaos. He said federal agents are terrorizing communities across California and the Bay in a stated administration goal of removing undocumented migrants.

""As bad as it looks, it's worse when you get up close to it,"" said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, (D) CA-10. ""This is the most corrupt administration, certainly in our lifetimes, and maybe in history.""

He joined his congressional colleague at the small news conference to deliver a fiery-tongued lashing of President Donald Trump. Both men hit familiar themes that the American democracy — due to the use of federal agents and National Guard troops in multiple cities — has lost its way.

What they're saying:

""I don't trust the feds in their ability to abide by our immigrant neighbors,"" said Dan Morley of the non-profit watchdog group, Indivisible Project.

He feared the shuttered federal prison in Dublin could see new life as a detention center for ICE.

The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons has previously said this site, shuttered in 2024 due to a prison sex scandal, won't be reopened or used as an ICE detention facility. But in contentious political times, straight answers can be viewed as misdirection of the masses.

""We know if that immigration (detainment) center gets open,"" said Morely. ""If they have a facility, they will fill it. And they will fill it by racially profiling our neighbors.""

What's next:

Watchdog groups promise protests and civil disobedience if either site is reopened.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”

The government is accused of denying detainees proper access to food, water and medical care and coercing them to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and faced deportation, the lawsuit alleges.

“This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.”

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman presided at the hearing just days after Van Brunt’s group and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed the lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order. The judge said the allegations are “disgusting.”

“To have to sleep on a floor next to an overflowing toilet — that’s obviously unconstitutional,” Gettleman said.

Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site.

Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.”

“The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge.

The lead plaintiffs in the case, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, were in the courtroom Tuesday at the judge’s insistence. The Mexican immigrants, who’ve lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, had been held at Broadview until Friday but remain in government custody.

Testifying with the help of a translator, Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. He said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste.

“It was just really bad. … It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge.

For months advocates have raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-11-02T021214Z_1948632989_RC20OHA3KZP8_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 20:56:53.813271

Guevara added that she got sick when she was at the Broadview facility.","U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman will issue a temporary restraining order against the Department of Homeland Security regarding the Broadview ICE facility after a lawsuit was filed over conditions inside.

At the end of a nearly six-hour hearing Tuesday, Judge Gettleman said he believed a group of plaintiffs, including multiple people who have been detained at the facility, have made a sufficient case to justify some sort of court order, but that he wanted ""to be able to fashion that in the most appropriate way I can."" Gettleman said he will formally issue the temporary restraining order, and go over what exactly it entails, at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday. Before that, he wants to see photos and videos from inside the facility.

The plaintiffs who brought the class-action lawsuit said they feel conditions at the facility on Beach Street in Broadview are overcrowded and dirty and not fit for humans. The facility is designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours, but since the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Chicago area began, often has held some migrants for days.

Gettleman said the Broadview facility has essentially become a prison. While he hasn't revealed what types of restrictions he plans to include in his order, he could go so far as to order it closed.

One of the major issues attorneys focused on during the lengthy hearing was the lack of access to legal representation for immigrants detained in Broadview. Attorneys for detainees said that issue could be fixed almost immediately with a court order, since people held there were able to contact and visit with their attorneys before ""Operation Midway Blitz"" began in September.

The government has argued the Broadview facility is a temporary holding facility, which contributes to the lack of communication and in-person meetings, but plaintiffs in the lawsuit have argued people are there for days, making the ""temporary"" nature of the facility moot.

The plaintiffs called five witnesses Tuesday who had been detained in the facility. Each testified that it was overcrowded; that there wasn't adequate food, medical care, or sleeping conditions; and that they could not access showers, soap, or other hygiene items.

The plaintiffs said detainees are only given two meals a day and none of them hot. They said the facility lacks toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, cleaning materials, and menstrual products, and that people have had to sleep on the floor or in plastic chairs with only a plastic blanket. The plaintiffs further alleged, among other things, that toilets are overflowing with human waste, and that the waste has accumulated around toilets where people had to sleep.

There were also allegations that detainees were coerced into signing documents they did not understand.

The complaint alleges federal agents at Broadview ""cut off detainees from the outside world,"" which the government has denied.

The government attorney said because detainees are supposed to be held at the Broadview facility for a short timeframe, there are not beds in the holding cells. She also said detainees do not get new clothes for the same reason, unless they soil themselves.

The attorney for the feds said the government has also ""improved"" conditions at Broadview.

An attorney for the plaintiffs responded, ""We are not talking about one person sleeping on the floor for one night,"" and said all the conditions taken together are the issue. The plaintiffs' attorney added that the federal government's wanting to deport people more quickly is not an excuse to deny constitutional rights.

Government lawyers argued that granting a temporary restraining order to close the facility would ""halt the government's ability to enforce immigration law in Illinois"" and that granting a temporary restraining order to restrict or oversee their methods

Witnesses break down as they detail conditions inside facility

Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 25, said he was born in Mexico and has lived in the U.S. and in Chicago for 3 years. He said he works as a construction worker, and was arrested by federal agents at Foster Avenue and Pulaski Road on Wednesday, Oct. 29.

Gonzalez said he was taken to the Broadview facility, where he said he was never told he could meet with an attorney, and was given documents asking if he wanted to leave.

""I said, 'Well, I have my family here. I don't have anyone in Mexico,"" he said, ""and I don't want to leave. I don't want to go back to my country.""

Gonzalez said he was then put in a cell with what he estimated were 150 to 170 people, and no beds. He said he was sitting in a chair to sleep, and there were not enough chairs for everyone.

""When I could stand up, I would have to jump with my fee, to I would not step on the next person,"" he said as he began to sob on the stand. ""It was too much. It was too much. It was just too much.""

Gonzalez said there were toilets close to each other, and he could not drink the water from the attached sink because too many people were using it, and it was dirty. He said people received three water bottles for day and a small sandwich in the morning, and there were sandwiches and bottles everywhere in the cell.

On cross-examination, government attorneys asked Gonzalez if he was able to call home and speak to his family, which he said he was. They also asked him if he asked his family to bring him medication or to contact an attorney, and he said he did not.

Another witness, a 47-year-old man named Felipe, said he was also born in Mexico and has lived in the U.S. for 31 years. He said he works as a package delivery person for Amazon.

Felipe said he was arrested Thursday, Oct. 30, in Wheeling, Illinois, and was taken to Broadview — where he said estimated a cell contained 120 to 150 people. He said the cell was still packed when 50 people were removed.

He said the bathroom in the cell was separated by a wall, but it did not protect privacy, and he had to wake up someone who was on or near the toilet to use the bathroom.

""They never mopped. They never swept,"" Felipe said. ""They were a garbage can, but it was overflowed.""

Felipe said the detainees were given subway sandwiches, but he only ate the first one he received because he ended up getting sick with diarrhea. He added that the detainees received three 8-ounce bottles of water a day.

Felipe said he was not able to see an attorney and would have wanted to do so.

He also said he was told to sign papers, which he claimed were described to him as court papers, but which he actually saw were self-deportation papers that would bar him from returning for a certain number of years.

""My whole life is here,"" he said.

A third witness, Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara, participated in the hearing remotely from Honduras. She said she had lived in Joliet with her brother for five years, and has two children — a 5-year-old daughter and a 9-month-old. She said her kids were at the babysitter and she was going to work when she was arrested at 5 a.m. Oct. 2 and taken to Broadview.

Guevara said she was held for four days in a large cell and one day in a personal cell. In the big cell, she said staff never cleaned — and one time, the detainees even asked for a broom to clean the cell themselves, which she never received.

Guevara said the bathroom was also dirty and the toilet was overflowing, and the detainees tried to clean it themselves. Guevara also said there were no showers, no soap or sanitizer, and no toothpaste or toothbrushes.

""They wouldn't give us anything when it comes to cleaning,"" she said, ""absolutely nothing.""

Guevara said she was sometimes given two meals and sometimes three. She said the meals were from Subway and were cold, and sometimes just had vegetables. She said detainees had to wait for meals to get water.

Guevara added that she got sick when she was at the Broadview facility. She said the day after sleeping on the floor, she couldn't feel her feet and was vomiting.

Guevara said she asked to go to the hospital, but her request was declined. She said she was taken to out of the cell in a wheelchair and was given medicine for vomiting. She said she was not told what the medicine was.

Guevera further said she was asked to sign deportation papers, which she said she could not read or understand because they were in English, and she does not speak or understand English.

She said she was told she would be held at the facility until she signed the papers, so she did so.

Guevara said she was taken to a facility in Louisiana from Broadview.

What does FMCSA’s emergency non-domiciled CDL interim final rule do?
Under the rule, an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) would no longer be enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL.
FMCSA estimated that the changes would take about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry.
According to the groups, Rivera Lujan is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old.","A lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit says FMCSA’s interim final rule on non-domiciled CDLs isn’t an emergency and will cause “irreparable harm” to drivers.

On behalf of truck driver Jorge Rivera Lujan, the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 20 by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Then on Oct. 24, the groups filed an emergency motion that asked the court to delay the rule’s effective date until the lawsuit plays out.

Following responses from FMCSA on Oct. 31 and from the plaintiffs on Nov. 3, the court will soon decide whether or not to let the rule remain in effect.

What does FMCSA’s emergency non-domiciled CDL interim final rule do?

The rule, which was announced by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in late September, significantly limits the authority of state driver’s license agencies to issue and renew non-domiciled CDLs for individuals from foreign jurisdictions.

Pointing to recent high-profile crashes and an internal audit, Duffy called it a “national emergency” and made the rule effective immediately.

Under the rule, an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) would no longer be enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL. Additionally, asylum seekers, asylees, refugees and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would be excluded from eligibility. The majority of current non-domiciled CDL-holders possessed an EAD. FMCSA estimated that the changes would take about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry. Many of the individuals may be eligible for other employment in the United States.

While the rule is already in effect, the agency is accepting comments through Nov. 28. The agency has already received nearly 4,300 comments, with many of them coming from truck drivers who say the rule is taking away their livelihood.

FMCSA’s response to lawsuit

The agency argued that much of the danger surrounding issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers is that there is no way to review their driving records.

“Without a verified driving record, there is a serious risk that unsafe or high-risk drivers – who may have prior violations, suspensions or a history of crashes in foreign jurisdictions – could be granted non-domiciled CDLs and operate large trucks and buses on U.S. roadways,” attorneys for FMCSA wrote in the Oct. 31 response brief. “Thus, limiting the eligibility of classes of potential applicants whose driving history cannot be ascertained will increase safety by appreciably reducing the number of non-domiciled CDL drivers with unknown driver safety records on the nation’s highways.”

Instead of arguing that there is a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle, FMCSA argues that it is reasonable for them to determine that “credentialing individuals whose driving history is largely or entirely unknown does not provide an appropriate margin of safety.”

Plaintiffs’ arguments

Rivera Lujan has been a truck driver for 11 years.

According to the groups, Rivera Lujan is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old. He said he tried to renew his CDL on Sept. 30 but was told he could not do so because of the interim final rule.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” Rivera Lujan said in a news release. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

During its reply to the court on Nov. 3, the plaintiffs said that FMCSA did not justify its decision to make the rule effective before going through a typical rulemaking process.

“FMCSA does not meaningfully contest that the factual evidence it cited does not demonstrate an emergency,” the plaintiffs wrote. “And FMCSA has expressly disclaimed ‘a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.’”

The groups contend that the interim final rule already is causing significant harm to truck drivers like Rivera Lujan.",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-04-25-Nondom-lawsuit-pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 20:57:08.787663

The Baltimore facility will be between 11,500 and 18,500 square feet, while the Hyattsville space will range between 3,750 and 5,000 square feet.

“ICE is definitely on the footprint of those contracts, and it is a fair amount of space,” said Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey, who specializes in federal employment. “I was kind of doing some back of the napkin calculations [for the Baltimore location].

In September, the GSA's Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement"" in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the ""unique"" quick period of one week to submit bids.

ICE previously requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country, including Baltimore.

Hyattsville sits in the middle of Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties, which hold more than half of Maryland’s Latino and Hispanic population.

“GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission,” Will Powell, a spokesman for GSA told WYPR when asked for comment.

ICE did not respond for comment in time for publication.

It’s not just office space that is tipping off a possible larger ICE presence.

ICE and DHS awarded a contract at the end of September to Kinro Manufacturing for more than $233,000 for six months worth of shelf stable meals.

The contract is for 42,000 meals in Baltimore and Salisbury, Maryland.

The contract and proposals come as President Donald Trump recently said ICE raids “have not gone far enough,” during an interview with 60 Minutes.

In response, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News, “No one is off the table.”

“We're going to use all the tools in the toolbox. We have great federal partners,” he said. “Department of Justice has been outstanding with us, and we are going to team up with everyone that wants to work with us, and we're to go out there and keep the president's promise to sure that we have one of the largest deportation efforts ever.""

The president has also ordered the mobilization of more than 23,000 National Guard troops for “quick reaction forces” to deal with civil disturbances.

“Residents and State employees have planned their lives and careers around receiving (federal student loan) forgiveness,” the attorneys general wrote.
The loan forgiveness program applies to a wide range of workers beyond those employed by state government and municipalities, including those who work for some nonprofit organizations.
“To be clear, (the public service loan forgiveness program) is not merely a convenient recruitment tool for State employers,” the attorneys general wrote.","For the 29th time so far this year, Arizona is suing the Trump administration, this time to block the U.S. Department of Education from cancelling public service student loan forgiveness for employees of government agencies and organizations that help undocumented immigrants, promote diversity, equity and inclusion or take part in political protest.

“Public service should never be weaponized for political games,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. “This rule undermines the very spirit of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and threatens workers who dedicate their careers to public service. I’m proud to join my fellow attorneys general in suing to block it.”

On Monday, Mayes joined a coalition of 21 other Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the new rules from the U.S. Department of Education. The states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to declare the rule unlawful and block the department from implementing it.

The rule, finalized Oct. 31, allows the department itself to decide that agencies or organizations are ineligible for student loan forgiveness if the Trump administration says they have a “substantial illegal purpose.” The rule is scheduled to go into effect in July 2026.

But the Department of Education’s description of an illegal purpose is based on its own ideological agenda, the attorneys general wrote.

“In seeking to crack down on specific activities disfavored by this Administration, the true intent behind the Rule is clear,” the attorneys general wrote. “The Department seeks to chill the activities of public service employers by discouraging their employees from what it deems objectionable forms of public service.”

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was created by Congress in 2007 to encourage professionals to go into public service careers with lower pay than private sector jobs, where they might not otherwise be able to pay off their student loan debt. After 10 years of regular payments while working in public service, the federal government forgives remaining student loan debt for those in the program.

“Over the years, (the program) has enabled more than one million public servants to pursue careers that might have otherwise been out of reach,” Mayes’ office wrote in a statement. “For state governments, (the program) is a critical tool to recruit and retain qualified professionals in vital fields like education, health care, and law enforcement.”

In addition to the lawsuit from the attorneys general, a group of more than a dozen cities, labor unions and nonprofit organizations from across the country filed a separate suit in federal court in Massachusetts on Monday seeking “to restore the promise that a bipartisan Congress made to public-service workers and their employers in establishing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program nearly 20 years ago.”

The Arizona Education Association, the largest teachers union in the state, was unavailable for comment, but its parent organization, the National Education Association, joined in the suit alongside other labor unions.

“The new rule imposes harsh and illegal restrictions, makes repayment less affordable, and silences the voices of educators and other beneficiaries of the programs,” NEA President Becky Pringle said in a statement. “We refuse to stand by while politicians trap dedicated educators in generations of debt.”

Congress was clear, the attorneys general wrote in their lawsuit, that all government employees — except for elected members of Congress — were eligible for public service student loan forgiveness.

The states have benefited greatly from the loan forgiveness program, Mayes and the other attorneys general argued, because it helped them to recruit “first responders, early childhood educators, librarians, nurses, public defenders, and public prosecutors” who might otherwise have gone to work in the private sector to ensure they could pay off their student loans.

“Residents and State employees have planned their lives and careers around receiving (federal student loan) forgiveness,” the attorneys general wrote.

The loan forgiveness program applies to a wide range of workers beyond those employed by state government and municipalities, including those who work for some nonprofit organizations.

“To be clear, (the public service loan forgiveness program) is not merely a convenient recruitment tool for State employers,” the attorneys general wrote. “For many employees with debt loads that reach into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, (the program) is the only reason they can afford to work in public service in the first place.”

In March, Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. Department of Education to change eligibility rules for the public service loan forgiveness program based on the administration’s view of “substantial illegal purpose.” The new rule disqualifies employees of government entities or organizations that “aid and abet” violations of federal immigration law, support protests against the Trump administration or back gender-affirming care for transgender youth. (The administration denigrated health care for trans children as the “chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary States for ‘purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents.’”)

The attorneys general argue that Trump’s executive order and the Department of Education rule attempt to give power to the department that has not been conferred to it by Congress.

“The Department redefines ‘qualifying employer’ in a sharp departure from the corresponding definition of ‘public service job’ that Congress put in place in 2007 — and that has remained substantively intact since then — but provides no adequate justification for this grant of unfettered discretion,” the AGs wrote.

The rule also targets state government entities while exempting federal government entities, without explanation, the attorneys general claimed.

“Put simply, the Final Rule is nothing more than a laundry list of this Administration’s policy priorities designed to attack lawful conduct it does not agree with,” the attorneys general wrote.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/unemployment-debt-bills-piggy-bank-2048x1286.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:01:05.655540

The Justice Department drops Baltimore County from its “sanctuary jurisdiction” list after new ICE partnership amid nationwide immigration debate.

The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that Baltimore County has been removed from the Trump administration’s list of so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions,” following a new agreement with federal immigration authorities.

The decision, announced late last week, comes after the county signed a Memorandum of Understanding with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to collaborate on immigration enforcement efforts.

The move follows the release of a federal list in August naming more than 500 jurisdictions nationwide that the administration said were obstructing federal immigration laws.

“Despite restrictions from state leadership, Baltimore County has shown a willingness to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement,” Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward said in a statement. “This is a small step toward restoring public safety, and we appreciate the county’s commitment to updating its policies.”

Baltimore County is the second jurisdiction to be removed from the list since its publication.

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security classified eight Maryland counties, including Baltimore County and Baltimore City, as “sanctuary jurisdictions.”

| Related: Trump admin. deems 8 Maryland counties and Baltimore ‘Sanctuary jurisdictions’

The list also included Anne Arundel, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Queen Anne’s and Talbot counties.

DHS said the jurisdictions were “deliberately and shamefully obstructing” federal immigration enforcement and urged them to align with federal laws.

Local leaders across Maryland criticized the designation, saying it was politically motivated and inaccurate.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown called the federal designation “inflammatory rhetoric” and “legally flawed.” He said Maryland’s policies comply with the Constitution and pledged to defend the state against any punitive action.

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said earlier this year that the city was not a sanctuary jurisdiction because it does not run its own detention facilities. “We are a welcoming city, and we make no apologies for that,” Scott said in a statement at the time.

Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s office also rejected the label in May, saying the county prioritizes public safety and community policing while following all federal, state, and local laws.

A preliminary audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that, mostly during 2024-2025, multiple states were using the money improperly. California, the biggest culprit, spends over $1.3 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants.

We're actually clawing that money back from those states now, but the fact that that could still happen is very frustrating to all of us,"" Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told Fox Business in late October.

According to CMS, the other states and districts in question, including Illinois, spent the second most (around $30 million). Followed by Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Colorado. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-M.N., said the law prohibits this from happening.

But you know what, you didn't have the verification tools in place to enforce the law so we put the verification in the 'Working Families Tax Cut Act,' also known as the Big, Beautiful Bill,"" Emmer told Fox News Digital last month.

While federal Medicaid money is supposed to be prohibited from being used for illegal immigrants, it can be used by states for emergency treatment, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. But CMS says some Democratic-led states aren't following the law.

""Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn’t optional—it’s the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans. Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won’t tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable,"" said HHS Press Secretary Emily Hilliard.

We are clawing back that money. We have already gotten hundreds and millions of dollars back which again, proves that states were guilty, or they wouldn't give us the money back otherwise,"" Oz said.

But McConnell found that the conditions were too unrelated to transportation issues for the DOT to try to impose such funding conditions.
“Had Congress wished to try to make federal transportation funding contingent on cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement, it could certainly have attempted to do so,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote.
McConnell’s ruling Tuesday served another blow to the Trump administration.
But on Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump suggested on social media that funding would resume only after the government reopens.","Democratic attorneys general have notched another victory after a federal judge in Rhode Island Tuesday ruled the Trump administration can’t tie billions of dollars meant for road and bridge repairs to states’ cooperation with civil immigration enforcement.

The administration “blatantly overstepped” its statutory authority in trying to place immigration-related conditions on federal funding U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in his permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Transportation.

“The Constitution demands the court set aside this lawless behavior,” McConnell wrote.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha celebrated McConnell’s ruling.

“It should go without saying that the ability of Rhode Islanders to travel on safe roads and bridges cannot hang on the political whims of one man,” Neronha said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Twenty states, led by California, filed suit in Providence in May after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a directive outlining the administration’s expectations for cooperation in return for infrastructure grants that had already been approved by Congress.

20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

“Federal grants come with a clear obligation to adhere to federal laws,” Duffy said in a statement when the directive was issued in April. “It shouldn’t be controversial — enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech.”

Joining Rhode Island and California in the lawsuit were AGs from Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont.

The states argued that such a directive was outside the scope of the agency’s power and was “impermissibly vague.”

DOT attorneys have argued in court that the statute governing the agency, as enacted by Congress, allows it to impose any conditions on grant agreements so long as it “reasonably determines” those conditions align with its core mission.

But McConnell found that the conditions were too unrelated to transportation issues for the DOT to try to impose such funding conditions.

“Had Congress wished to try to make federal transportation funding contingent on cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement, it could certainly have attempted to do so,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote.

He added that the Trump administration had failed to explain why the court should stay any ordered relief, noting that the DOT never even appealed the preliminary injunction that was issued in June.

“The court sees no reason it should stay relief now that the case has reached summary judgment,” McConnell wrote.

McConnell’s ruling Tuesday served another blow to the Trump administration. On Oct. 31, he ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tap into contingency funds to cover food stamp funding amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.

Liz Breadon, who represents Allston-Brighton on Boston City Council, called it the largest single raid she’s aware of in the neighborhood this year. She said, as far as she knows, all of the people detained had some form of legal immigration status.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement drove up to Allston Car Wash on Cambridge Street Tuesday morning. Agents detained nine immigrants who were all working at the facility, co-owner Mike Delaney told GBH News.

“Our main concern is with our employees that were detained,” Delaney said. “We really don’t want to do anything that would stir the hornet’s nest.”

“It was kind of crazy,” he said.

Delaney said some of his employees were cleaning the interiors of customers’ cars when they were detained, and that the raid ended around 11 a.m. He declined to speak to media further out of concern of jeopardizing his detained employees.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to requests for comment about the arrests, what the charges were for the individuals and where they were taken.

ICE has made a number of arrests and conducted several official operations in Massachusetts, including one called Operation 2.0 in September. The agency announced more than 1,400 immigrants were detained by the agency that month, with more than 600 having serious criminal convictions or charges.

A number of community members and volunteers for LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA arrived later to witness the scene, document and confirm details.

Councilor Breadon was alerted to the arrests and arrived at the car wash around 10:45 a.m.

“Someone said there were as many as 17 cars, but I cannot verify the exact number of cars. But it was a very big raid for Allston-Brighton,” she said.

Breadon told GBH News this is the largest immigration raid she knows of in her district under the Trump administration.

She arrived after the arrests, as vehicles were driving immigrants away. She saw what she believes to be an ICE vehicle departing the lot, a black SUV with tinted windows and Texas license plates.

Breadon spoke with a manager at the scene.

“My understanding is that they all had documentation, whether it was a green card or a work authorization card or whatever, they all have documentation, but they were not allowed to go and get their papers,” she said.

“Three people from the same family were taken,” said Heloisa Galvão, executive director and co-founder of the Brazilian Women’s Group, an area nonprofit that helps immigrants. She said no Brazilians were arrested, and that those arrested were local Guatemalans.

The car wash owner, who knows many of the employees personally, declined to give information about who was detained. GBH News could not immediately identify the people who were detained.

Galvão has been in contact with community members who know the employees.

“It’s revolting what the government is doing. We can’t take this anymore,” she said.

“It’s very distressing because these are members of our community, their kids go to our schools, they attend our churches in the neighborhood,” Breadon said. “They’re just hard-working immigrants who are trying to make a better life for their families.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/6e89636/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa3%2F2f%2Fe128c39c4f9092b0466f85a93703%2Fgettyimages-2225418082.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:01:18.079471

Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that the project developers would not “suffer immediate and significant hardship” if the Trump administration were allowed to reconsider the permit.

The decision would effectively allow the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to re-evaluate its approval of the project’s construction and operations plan. The agency had approved the plan on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Mr. Trump’s second term began.

As proposed, SouthCoast Wind would include 141 turbines in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket. When completed, it would generate up to 2,400 megawatts of energy, enough to power more than 840,000 homes in New England.

The project is being developed in two phases and has not yet started construction. The first phase, known as SouthCoast Wind 1, would provide power to both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Representatives for SouthCoast Wind did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier filing in the case, Michael Brown, the chief executive of SouthCoast Wind, said the company had already spent more than $600 million on the project.

“When making these investment decisions, SouthCoast Wind understandably expected that the federal government would follow valid statutes and regulations setting out criteria for issuance of permits,” Mr. Brown wrote.

Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents developers of offshore wind farms as well as companies that drill for oil and gas in the ocean, said he was disappointed by the ruling. “We’re concerned about any delays in any of these projects when they’ve already gone through the vetting and approval process,” Mr. Milito said in an interview Tuesday.

The Trump administration said in September that it would weigh whether to revoke the Biden-era approval of the project. Months earlier, in March, the town of Nantucket sued the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in an effort to block the project. The town accused the agency of failing to comply with environmental and historical preservation laws when it issued the permit.

Soon after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump issued a sweeping order to halt all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms. His administration has since gone after several wind farms that had been given federal permits by the Biden administration and were either under construction or about to start.

In April, the Interior Department ordered that work be stopped at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of New York that had received all necessary approvals from the Biden administration and was 30 percent completed. After several weeks and negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration allowed Empire Wind to proceed.

White House officials suggested they had relented only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. Ms. Hochul denied that any such deal had been made.

“I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” Mr. Bessent said on CNN on Sunday. He described the economy as being in a “period of transition” because of a pullback in government spending to reduce the deficit. He called on the Fed to support the economy by cutting interest rates.

Mr. Bessent’s remarks added to pressure on the Fed and deflected blame from Mr. Trump in case the economy does ultimately face a downturn, reinforcing a strategy that has been in place since the start of the year. As the administration has imposed aggressive tariffs on nearly all of America’s trading partners and slashed federal spending, potentially slowing growth, it has sought to pin blame squarely on the Fed in the event of an economic downturn.

“This is all going to be put at the Fed’s feet,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the accounting firm RSM.

For months, Mr. Trump has assailed Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, for moving too slowly to lower interest rates. That has included branding Mr. Powell as “Mr. Too Late” and a “numbskull.” Over the summer, he escalated his pressure campaign on the central bank and took more aggressive steps to reshape the top ranks responsible for making policy decisions.

Mr. Trump is in a legal battle set to be decided by the Supreme Court after his attempt to oust Lisa Cook, a governor, from her position over allegations of mortgage fraud. In August he appointed Mr. Miran, who at the time was one of his top economic advisers, to the Fed’s Board of Governors after one member, Adriana Kugler, stepped down before her term ended.

Since joining the central bank in September, Mr. Miran has pushed hard for substantially lowering interest rates. In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, he warned that the Fed risked causing an economic downturn if it did not do so.

“If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he said. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”

But that view is not widely shared by other Fed officials or by most economists across Wall Street. At the past two policy meetings, Mr. Miran has been the lone dissenter in favor of a bigger, half-point cut. Last month, most policymakers backed a quarter-point reduction, while one official dissented in support of keeping interest rates steady because of his concerns about inflation.

Mr. Bessent’s mention of a recession is unusual for a Treasury secretary; downturns can become self-fulfilling if consumers and businesses pull back in anticipation of a contraction.

Despite Mr. Bessent’s comments, the Treasury Department said this week in its statement on the economy for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee that it did not expect a recession.

“Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks,” Treasury economists wrote. “However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low.”

They noted that the federal government shutdown and declining federal employment were headwinds for growth. The labor market had been flashing some worrying signals in recent months before the shutdown caused, in effect, a blackout of government statistics. Job growth had ground to a halt, and the breadth of sectors actually hiring had narrowed.

Those trends appear to have continued. And yet, Mr. Powell and other officials like John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have not conveyed much concern about the economy’s tipping into a recession.

Mr. Powell, at a news conference after the Fed’s latest meeting to set rates, questioned whether there would be sufficient support to lower interest rates in December at a time when the Fed’s goals of low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market are in tension with each other.

As Mr. Bessent and Mr. Miran have asserted, the housing market does remain under significant pressure, a trend that began in 2023. But the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates, which would help support the housing market through lower mortgage rates, is significantly constrained because of the price pressures resulting from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Matthew Martin, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he did not view a recession as the most likely outcome for the economy, though he conceded that the Fed was walking a “tight path” and that some cracks had emerged in the economy’s foundation.

Some industries have felt more pain than others amid uncertainty over tariffs and other Trump administration policies. Perhaps the most noticeable, Mr. Martin said, was the pullback in the manufacturing sector despite the administration’s efforts to revive it.

“That’s an area where tariffs increased uncertainty and decreased demand,” he said.

Factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in October, according to survey results released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management. Manufacturers have also continued to shed workers.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that while the national economy was not in a recession, it appeared to be struggling to avoid one. In an analysis last month, he found that 22 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia were in or near a recession and that the fate of the economy could hinge on how California and New York fare in the coming months.

“Only a few industries are still adding to payrolls, mainly health care and hospitality,” Mr. Zandi said. “Construction, manufacturing, technology, finance, government and many professional services are shedding jobs.”

Mr. Duffy has warned repeatedly of looming disaster in the national airspace, as controllers — who are among the essential federal employees forced to work through shutdowns without pay — face a second paycheck that is “a big fat zero,” as he put it on Tuesday. According to Mr. Duffy and the controllers’ union, many have taken on side jobs to make ends meet.

But while Mr. Duffy has frequently pledged to reduce air traffic when controller absences rise, his threat to shut down airspace conveyed an increased sense of alarm.

“The F.A.A., and us, will close the airspace down, we will restrict the airspace when we feel it’s not safe,” he said. As the transportation secretary, Mr. Duffy oversees the Federal Aviation Administration.

For all of his warnings about the dangers shutdown poses to air travel, Mr. Duffy has firmly maintained that it is safe to fly. He repeated that assertion on Tuesday, with a caveat.

“People always ask me is the system safe, and I would tell you yes, the system is safe — and if it wasn’t, we would shut it down,” Mr. Duffy said, echoing comments he has made in the past.

“But with this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system,” he added.

Even before the shutdown, the work force of certified controllers was sorely overtaxed, with most routinely working overtime hours to compensate for the fact that about 3,000 of approximately 14,000 positions are vacant. The vacancies have also forced some controllers to cover two positions, and Mr. Duffy said on Tuesday that the shutdown was exacerbating that workload.

“They have to work those two positions because their colleagues have called in sick or they’re waiting tables or they’re driving Uber,” Mr. Duffy said.

He added that the F.A.A. was accustomed to enlisting different air traffic facilities to help avoid interruptions and maintain air travel safety when certain towers and centers faced a shortfall of controllers. Last Friday, which saw 35 facilities experience substantial shortfalls, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers assigned to facilities in the New York area were absent.

But without an act of Congress, he said, there were no extraordinary measures he could take to compensate controllers for their labor.

“We’ve tried to pull every dollar we can for different programs where we’re legally allowed to pull and fund,” he said. “But the truth is, the law doesn’t allow me to say, ‘the Congress hasn’t funded the government, I can just go find money and pay air traffic controllers.’ That’s not the way our Constitution works and our government works.”

The F.A.A. has drawn on prior year funds to sustain some operations, including the agency’s academy that trains new controllers, through the shutdown. But the academy is expected to run out of those funds by Nov. 15, according to an F.A.A. spokeswoman. The Trump administration has also covered the salaries of active duty military by reprogramming federal funds, with a small percentage of the salaries being covered through a private donation.

Hours after that ultimatum, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, appeared to walk back the president’s comments. She told reporters at a news briefing that the administration is “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments in November.

“We’re complying with the court’s order, and we’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can, and as quickly as we can, but it’s going to take some time,” Ms. Leavitt said.

The whiplash on Tuesday only added to the persistent sense of panic and anxiety among the roughly one in eight poor Americans who rely on SNAP, the nation’s largest anti-hunger program. The president’s comments once again raised the risk that these families could find themselves vulnerable to hunger and financial hardship, even though a federal court ordered Mr. Trump and his aides to restart nutrition assistance.

To comply with that directive, administration officials told two separate courts this week that they would make only partial payments to people on SNAP, essentially halving their aid for November. That alone had proved insufficient for cities and nonprofits, which had returned to court on Tuesday — before Mr. Trump’s threat — to try to restore full benefit amounts and force the government to pay the money more quickly.

“This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye L. Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing one of the lawsuits that has repeatedly challenged the Trump administration, said in a post on social media.

The White House declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump’s plans. The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment.

In the original order, published on Saturday, Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island essentially gave the Trump administration a choice. He said it could provide full SNAP payments by Monday or partial benefits by Wednesday, while finding that the government had a legal obligation to sustain the program if the funds were available.

The Trump administration chose the latter approach, financed using about $5 billion set aside for SNAP in an emergency reserve previously established by Congress. The Agriculture Department could have tapped an ample store of additional funds to provide full benefits to those enrolled in food stamps, but the agency declined to do so.

As a result, families stood to receive about half as much in nutrition benefits this month than they would have normally — and, potentially, only after weeks or months of delay. Officials at the Agriculture Department had acknowledged these limitations in court filings, even as the administration refused to make other funds available for SNAP.

By Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest he would halt food stamps entirely. He said on social media that the benefits were managed “haphazardly” and attacked Democrats, a set of comments that recalled his previous threat to punish the party and cut its favored programs during the shutdown.

Some congressional Democrats expressed outrage over what they saw as a patently illegal act.

“The president is not a king,” said Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House’s leading agriculture committee. “He is not free to disregard the rule of law whenever it becomes politically inconvenient for him.”

By that afternoon, Ms. Leavitt insisted that the president only sought to register his disapproval with using emergency funds to pay SNAP benefits. She said that Mr. Trump wanted those “funds preserved,” even though the administration had attested to a judge that it would exhaust that money during the shutdown.

Before the president posted his threat on social media, local leaders and nonprofits had filed anew in federal court in the hopes of securing a clearer order from Judge McConnell, one that would force the Trump administration to pay benefits rapidly and in full.

“Time is of the essence when it comes to hunger,” they wrote in their filing, prepared by lawyers from groups including Democracy Forward.

They said that the court “did not contemplate that millions would be deprived of basic nutritional assistance for weeks” while the government readied its partial benefits. They asked the judge to force the Trump administration to “release the unlawfully withheld funding, in its entirety, for November SNAP benefits.”

The filing, in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., was styled as a rebuttal of Mr. Comey’s claims that the charges he is facing should be thrown out as an act of vindictive prosecution by the Trump administration. He is accused of lying to and obstructing Congress in testimony on the investigation into Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, during which he was asked whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. “to be an anonymous source in news reports.”

Yet the prosecutors who wrote the filing spent as much time suggesting that Mr. Comey had used the confidant, Daniel C. Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, as a conduit to the news media as they did seeking to reject allegations that the indictment was vindictive. Mr. Richman had worked at the F.B.I. as a “special government employee,” leaving in early 2017.

Last month, lawyers for Mr. Comey accused President Trump of improperly ordering the Justice Department to prosecute him out of a deep personal animus reaching back to May 2017, when he was fired as F.B.I. director while overseeing the Trump-Russia investigation.

The lawyers pointed to the extraordinary origins of the case: a public message on social media in which Mr. Trump ordered his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to go after Mr. Comey, one of his most reviled adversaries. The demands came shortly after the president had ousted the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who had refused to indict Mr. Comey and replaced him with a neophyte prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, who quickly filed charges in the first criminal case she had ever handled.

Mr. Comey’s lawyers have also argued that the case Ms. Halligan filed should be dismissed because Mr. Trump improperly appointed her to her post as U.S. attorney. But in a separate motion on Monday, prosecutors rejected that claim.

The motion also included a highly unusual sworn statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi saying that on Friday, for “the avoidance of doubt,” she had retroactively named Ms. Halligan to a second post in the office — that of special attorney — with the authority to handle both Mr. Comey’s prosecution and a second case against Letitia James, New York’s attorney general and another of Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies.

While Mr. Comey’s lawyers described Mr. Trump’s social media message as “smoking-gun evidence” of vindictiveness, the prosecutors argued it was “hardly evidence at all” and merely part of “a mix of news reports, social-media posts and speculation” used to accuse the president of bias.

The prosecutors also claimed that the indictment of Mr. Comey was not born out of animus but rather addressed “the societal interests” of bringing charges against “a former F.B.I. director who lied to Congress about his conduct while at the helm of the nation’s primary federal law-enforcement agency.”

The indictment accuses Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020.

At that hearing, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked Mr. Comey whether he had authorized someone at the F.B.I. “to be an anonymous source in news reports.” The indictment says Mr. Comey misled the committee by saying that he had not done so.

Mr. Comey’s lawyers have attacked the indictment — as well as Mr. Cruz’s question — as imprecise and confusing. Moreover, they have said that Mr. Comey’s answer was not a detailed, direct response to Mr. Cruz, but was instead a “literally true statement” in which he said he stood by previous testimony he had given three years earlier when he was asked similar questions in a different congressional hearing.

Even though they were supposed to be addressing the question of vindictiveness, the prosecutors filled the opening pages of their filing with quotations from personal emails and texts messages between Mr. Comey and Mr. Richman, as well those between Mr. Richman and reporters.

While those communications could ultimately help prosecutors prove that Mr. Comey used Mr. Richman to communicate to the news media, it remained unclear what bearing they had on the specific charges in the case: namely, whether Mr. Comey was lying when he denied authorizing an F.B.I. employee to anonymously share information for news reports.

Prosecutors have not made clear what new reports they were referring to or which reporters may have worked on them.

Indeed, the new court filing quoted communications between Mr. Comey and Mr. Richman concerning several articles in The New York Times. Two cited in the filing touched on Mr. Comey’s controversial handling of the conclusion — and brief reopening — of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server close to the 2016 election in which she was the Democratic candidate.

The first article was a graphic The Times published on Nov. 2, 2016, outlining the pros and cons of the choices available to Mr. Comey in his handling of reopening the Clinton investigation. It did not contain any new information about the inquiry or cite Mr. Richman — or anyone else — as a source.

Still, the emails quoted in the filing suggest that Mr. Richman helped influence the abstract analysis presented in the article.

Before the graphic was published, Mr. Comey had complained about The Times’s coverage and said to Mr. Richman, “Perhaps you can make him smarter.” It is not clear whether that was a reference to the same reporter who was working on the graphic, but after it appeared, Mr. Comey wrote to Mr. Richman, “Well done my friend.”

The other article appeared to be an investigation published in April 2017 that scrutinized Mr. Comey’s handling of communications about the Clinton investigation. It featured on-the-record quotations from Mr. Richman. The indictment accused Mr. Comey of lying about authorizing an anonymous source to leak information to the news media.

The filing also discussed The Times’s publication, days after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, of information about Mr. Comey’s earlier conversations with the president. Mr. Comey later testified to Congress that he had directed Mr. Richman to share information about them, based on contemporaneous memos he had written.

The filing quoted a text Mr. Richman sent the author of those articles, Michael S. Schmidt, saying that he “just got go ahead” — a possible reference to Mr. Comey agreeing to let him serve as a source. Even if that were true, it could not be a basis for the criminal charge because the indictment accuses Mr. Comey of lying about using an F.B.I. employee to leak information and Mr. Richman was no longer working at the F.B.I. by then.

The new filing also disclosed an insinuating piece of evidence that did not appear to be related to either of the two charges detailed in the indictment. It instead appears related to a third charge that Ms. Halligan tried to bring against Mr. Comey, but that a grand jury rejected.

That involved a memo the C.I.A. sent to the F.B.I. on Sept. 7, 2016, containing intelligence about Russia’s interference in that year’s campaign. The F.B.I. had recently opened an investigation into Russian interference and the nature of the Kremlin’s ties to associates of the Trump campaign.

The memo itself broaches how Russian intelligence analysts had discussed purported emails saying that in late July 2016, Mrs. Clinton had supposedly approved a campaign plan centered on Mr. Trump and Russian hackers to distract from her own email scandal. Evidence gathered by a special counsel later showed that the purported emails were likely fabricated.

At the September 2020 hearing, a senator had asked Mr. Comey about the memo, but Mr. Comey said he had no memory of seeing it. The third charge Ms. Halligan tried to bring was over whether Mr. Comey lied in saying that.

The new filing said the F.B.I. had recently found handwritten notes from Mr. Comey, dated Sept. 26, 2016, that read: “HRC plan to tie Trump.”

Even though that appeared to refer to Mrs. Clinton, it is not clear why those notes would support the failed charge, since they do no mention the Sept. 7 memo at issue. It has long been public that Mr. Comey knew about the allegation itself because he was present for a briefing in August at which it was mentioned.

But the roughly one in eight families that receive SNAP may still be at risk of imminent hunger and financial hardship. The Trump administration opted against using its full stable of available funds — totaling into the billions of dollars — to sustain the nation’s largest anti-hunger program. As a result, eligible households may receive only half as much in benefits compared with their usual amounts, officials said.

It also remained unclear when food stamp recipients would actually receive their aid. The Trump administration had previously warned that it could take weeks to provision benefits on a partial basis, further underscoring the consequences of its budgetary decision on Monday.

Many Democrats sharply condemned the White House in response, saying the administration had a legal and moral obligation to pay full benefits on time, especially given the fact that there were plenty of available funds.

“It is not enough to do the bare minimum — the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who leads her party on the chamber’s top agriculture panel.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“There’s a process that has to be followed,” Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, told CNN on Sunday. “So, we got to figure out what the process is. President Trump wants to make sure that people get their food benefits.”

For the millions of poor Americans who depend on SNAP, the whiplash has only compounded the real, financial consequences from a shutdown that has no end in sight. Still, Mr. Trump has made no real effort to negotiate an end to the fiscal stalemate roiling Washington, where Democrats refuse to back a Republican measure to reopen the government because it does not extend a set of subsidies that help Americans afford health insurance.

The saga began last week, when the Trump administration said it would not tap billions of dollars that it had in reserve to continue funding nutrition benefits into this month, in a break with its own prior, public guidance. The move defied calls from congressional Democrats and Republicans alike, who wanted to see the White House protect the poor in the event that the shutdown continued for weeks longer.

The decision prompted cities, states, religious groups and nonprofits to sue, as they looked to spare low-income families from experiencing hunger for as long as the government remained closed. Two different federal courts ultimately sided with those groups on Friday, and the judges imposed a deadline of Monday for the Trump administration to communicate its next steps.

Only one of the judges, John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, explicitly ordered the Trump administration to restart SNAP payments immediately. In a written order, issued on Saturday, he said the Agriculture Department could either make full payments to SNAP recipients by Monday or partial payments by Wednesday.

Judge McConnell gave the government those extra days after administration officials told the court that providing partial payments could take weeks in some cases because of technical constraints. In doing so, he encouraged the Trump administration to fund payments in full using a second account at the Agriculture Department, one comprised largely of tariff revenues

Responding on Monday, the Trump administration maintained that it could not legally source SNAP payments this way, even though it had tapped the money repeatedly to sustain another federal nutrition program during the shutdown. In a sworn declaration, Patrick A. Penn, a top official at the Agriculture Department, added that using the money to provide full food stamp aid would also “stray from congressional intent.”

The assertion offered a stark contrast with the myriad other ways in which Mr. Trump has reprogrammed the budget during the shutdown to blunt some of its potential consequences. But SNAP is a function of government that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long aspired to cut and restrict, and one that Mr. Trump himself has associated with Democrats, whom he promised to punish as a result of the federal closure.

Anti-hunger groups broadly condemned the White House for opting to release only partial benefits. Crystal FitzSimons, the president of the Food Research & Action Center, said the decision would force “state agencies to scramble under unclear guidance, which will further delay benefits.”

But signs quickly emerged that the fight might not be over.

Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, which represented cities and nonprofits that had sued, said the group was “considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.”

“It shouldn’t take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided,” she added in a statement.

Hours after that ultimatum, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, appeared to walk back the president’s comments, saying that the administration was “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments this month.

It is unclear when recipients of food stamps will actually receive their aid, as the federal shutdown stretches on with no end in sight. Here’s what we know:

What are SNAP benefits?

The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is how the federal government helps people buy food if they cannot afford it. About 42 million Americans, living in 22 million households, use SNAP — representing roughly one in eight people in the United States. The benefits, commonly known as food stamps, average around $187 a month and cost the federal government about $8 billion monthly.

How does the shutdown affect SNAP?

Lawmakers must regularly approve money for SNAP through their normal budget process, which is currently paralyzed by a legislative impasse in Congress. Though the government shut down at the beginning of October, SNAP benefits were not expected to run out of funds until the beginning of November.

What can the government do to fund SNAP?

SNAP maintains a sizable reserve as a kind of rainy-day fund to cover any emergencies or shortfalls.

Many congressional Democrats and Republicans had encouraged the Trump administration to use this funding to preserve food stamps into November and protect the poor as the government continued to remain closed.

But the Trump administration declined to dip into those funds, even though the Agriculture Department had said previously that it could reprogram money to prevent benefit cuts. Administration officials have maintained that they could do little to rescue SNAP, despite the fact that they had moved around billions of dollars to sustain other functions of government while federal funding had lapsed.

More than two dozen states sued the Trump administration in an effort to unlock those funds before benefits ran out.

What have the courts said?

Two different federal courts ruled on Friday that the Trump administration had acted unlawfully in trying to hold back SNAP’s emergency funds. The twin court defeats amounted to a major rebuke of the White House — though only one of the judges, John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, explicitly ordered the Trump administration to restart SNAP payments immediately.

Mr. Trump said late Friday that the administration would provide the funding for food stamps, in what appeared to be a signal that the administration would ultimately obey the ruling.

But on Monday, the Trump administration instead said it would only partially fund SNAP in November, offering a temporary and limited reprieve to low-income families. Officials claimed in court filings that the administration could not legally use some funds available to the Agriculture Department — composed largely of tariff revenues — even though it had tapped that money repeatedly to sustain another federal nutrition program during the shutdown.

Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he would not fund SNAP at all, saying on social media that SNAP benefits would be distributed “only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”

Ms. Leavitt appeared hours later to suggest Mr. Trump’s statement was false, telling reporters that “we’re complying with the court’s order, and we’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can, and as quickly as we can, but it’s going to take some time.”

Lawyers for the administration had also previously suggested it could take weeks to disburse the benefits during the shutdown.

The Trump administration’s legal position on food stamps is a stark contrast with the myriad other ways in which Mr. Trump has reprogrammed the budget during the shutdown for his own agenda. SNAP is a function of government that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long aspired to cut and restrict, and one that Mr. Trump himself has associated with Democrats, whom he promised to punish as a result of the government shutdown.

How much do people get to spend?

The amount is adjusted each year, according to federal guidelines. In 2025, the maximum monthly benefit for one person is $292. For a household of four, it’s $975.

The amount also depends on which state recipients live in, and on factors like whether anyone in the household has a steady income or is a dependent.

How do people use SNAP?

The system is fully electronic, eliminating the paper food stamps that used to be presented at checkout. Each month, a dollar amount is loaded onto a card, which is used like a debit or credit card.

What can SNAP be used for?

Almost any food sold at a grocery store, including soda, chips, candy and snacks. (Some states have enacted rules that prevent SNAP money from being spent on soda and candy.) It can’t be used, however, for hot or cooked food, or for anything other than food.

Where can SNAP be used?

At most retailers, farmers’ markets and pharmacies that sell food, like Walgreens and CVS. SNAP cards can also be used to order from online markets like Walmart and Amazon.

Do recipients have to be U.S. citizens?

In most cases, yes. But people who are refugees, have been granted asylum, are from Cuba or Haiti, or belong to certain other groups are eligible if they meet income requirements. Green-card holders and permanent residents must wait five years to receive benefits.

About Public Citizen Litigation Group Public Citizen Litigation Group is the litigating arm of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.","Washington, D.C. — Four non-profit public-interest organizations filed a lawsuit today to challenge a new rule issued by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) that threatens to disqualify certain employers from eligibility for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The plaintiffs in the case — Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the American Immigration Council, The Door – A Center of Alternatives, Inc., and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) — are represented by Student Defense and Public Citizen Litigation Group.

ED established the new rule in response to an Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump. Finalized on October 31, the rule allows ED to disqualify employers from the PSLF program that are deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” by the Secretary of Education. Under the rule, ED will decide for itself whether this standard is met, based on its unilateral determination that an organization has engaged in activities disfavored by the administration concerning immigration, gender affirming care, and purported discrimination, along with other areas. The rule’s vague and overbroad language permits arbitrary enforcement against mission-driven organizations doing work or expressing opinions opposed by the government.

ED’s new regulation threatens to harm many of the 2.5 million federal student loan borrowers who have collectively worked more than 100 million months in public service jobs in order to qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

“The Rule will make it more difficult for employers in certain fields, such as advocacy on behalf of immigrants, to recruit and train employees, and will chill politically disfavored but legal activities by PSLF employers.” the complaint states. “The Rule is contrary to the PSLF statute, exceeds the Department’s regulatory authority, and violates the constitutional rights of nonprofits whose employees are statutorily eligible for PSLF.”

PSLF was created in 2007 to encourage students to pursue public service careers after graduation. The program offers federal student loan forgiveness to those who spend ten years repaying such loans while working full time in a public service job. The statute creating the program provides a clear list of qualifying employers, which include military service, emergency management, public health, government, public safety, law enforcement, early childhood education and library science, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, among others.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare the new rule unlawful and to declare that ED lacks the legal authority to change the statutory criteria for PSLF.

“Congress created PSLF to support those who work in public service jobs, not to let the President play favorites. The Trump administration should not be allowed to use a program designed to reward public service as a weapon against its political enemies,” said Cormac Early, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the case.

“Congress made a promise that if Americans give back to the country, the country will give back to them. Now the Trump Administration wants the power to renege on that promise if they disagree with your employer’s mission or perceived political views,” said Student Defense President Aaron Ament. “This new, unlawful rule is a slap in the face to the millions of first responders, health workers, teachers, and other public servants who believed the government could be trusted to keep its word.”

“The Trump Administration’s attack on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program strikes at the heart of civic space and public service. By targeting individuals who choose to work in nonprofits defending the human rights of immigrants and advancing diversity, inclusion, and transgender rights, this rule seeks to silence voices for equity and justice while weakening these organizations’ ability to recruit the next generation of leaders,” said Kerry Kennedy, President, RFK Human Rights.

“Public Service Loan Forgiveness was a clear commitment from the government to individuals who have dedicated themselves to public service,” said Jorge Loweree, Managing Director of Programs and Strategy at the American Immigration Council. “This regulation weaponizes that commitment. No one should be forced to choose between supporting their neighbors and securing the financial stability they were promised.”

“Latino families across the country rely on mission-driven nonprofits for immigration assistance, health care, and programs that support underserved young adults. This rule hands any administration a blank check to punish nonprofits it dislikes and jeopardizes the future of the teachers, nurses, veterans, and legal advocates who serve the public every day,” said Juan Proaño, CEO of the LULAC Institute. “LULAC Institute joined this case to defend the statute, protect our workforce, and ensure Latino borrowers are never forced to choose between serving their community and keeping a promise the government already made.”

In particular, this route is available to family members whose family relationship with their sponsor was formed after the sponsor’s grant of stateless leave. This route has no English language requirement, no maintenance, accommodation or other requirements; the family relationship is enough, regardless of when it was formed.

When the new rules come into force on 11 November 2025, further to the statement of changes HC 1333, family members are only eligible to join their stateless sponsor under Appendix Statelessness where the family relationship was formed before the sponsor’s first grant of statelessness leave. Where the family relationship was formed after the first grant of statelessness leave, family members must apply under Appendix FM.

There is, therefore, a short window in which the family members of stateless sponsors whose family relationship was formed after the initial grant of stateless leave can apply for family reunion under part 14 of the rules. If this window is missed, those family members would need to apply under Appendix FM.

Background

The rules for stateless persons and their family members were found in part 14 of the immigration rules until January 2024 when part 14 was replaced by Appendix Statelessness. Appendix Statelessness removed family reunion rights for family members of stateless sponsors, instead directing them to apply under Appendix FM.

Asylum Aid successfully challenged this change in February 2025 and the new rules on family reunion were deemed unlawful.

In response, the Home Office agreed to continue processing applications for stateless family reunion under part 14 of the immigration rules, despite the fact that this section of the rules had been archived.

The transitional provision in Appendix Statelessness states:

A partner or child of a stateless person can apply to stay in the UK under Part 14: Stateless Person on or after the 31 January 2024 if they have or last had permission as a partner or child under Part 14: Stateless Person. A child born in the UK to a parent who has either permission to enter or stay as a stateless person or is the partner of a stateless person can also apply for permission to stay under Part 14. For those eligible to apply under Part 14 as a partner or child of a stateless person, the Part 14 rules in place on the 30 January 2024 will apply. In any other case, a partner or child of a stateless person (who is not themselves stateless and therefore applying in their own right) can apply to join or remain with a Stateless person in the UK under Appendix FM.

There was (and still is) no clear process for applying under the archived rules and public information was unclear, incorrect and contradictory. However, this regime has continued since and it is still possible to apply under part 14 until the incoming rules take effect on 11 November 2025.

After 11 November, the rules in Appendix Statelessness will be the only statelessness family reunion rules going forward, apart from those who have already been granted family reunion leave under part 14.

Changes

Further to the most recent statement of changes, the following change will be made to archived part 14 of the rules on 11 November:

14.1. For paragraph 417 substitute: “417. Applications made on or before 10 November 2025 for permission as a partner or child of a stateless person will be decided under the Part 14 rules in force at that time. Applications on or after 11 November 2025 will be decided under Appendix Statelessness rules, if the applicant meets its requirements. If not, the applicant must apply for permission under Appendix FM”.

As we have already noted, the rules in part 14 allow for a partner or child to apply for family reunion irrespective of when the family relationship with their sponsor was formed. The new rules under Appendix Statelessness only allow for family members whose relationship pre-dated the sponsor’s grant of statelessness leave to apply.

Applications made under part 14 of the immigration rules don’t result in a grant of leave in line with the sponsor; the family member must complete their own five year period of residence before becoming eligible for settlement. Applicants who are granted under the new rules will be granted leave in line with the sponsor.

Part 14 of the immigration rules also does not allow a stateless person who has settled or naturalised as British to sponsor their family members, whereas the new rules coming into force will allow sponsors who have settled or naturalised as British to sponsor their family members provided that the family relationship existed before the sponsor’s initial grant of statelessness leave.

Drafting errors in new rules

It is also worth noting that there are drafting errors in the new rules. The Home Office is aware of these errors but they will not be corrected until the next statement of changes to the rules. When the caseworker guidance on ‘Permission to stay as a stateless person’ is next updated, it should explain the correct eligibility criteria.

The first error is that the rules have ‘and’ instead of ‘or’ at paragraph S 11.3 (b)(ii), which has the effect of excluding a person with five years’ leave to remain from sponsoring their family.

S 11.3. An application as a partner or child of a Stateless person under Appendix Statelessness must meet the following validity requirements:

(a) the applicant must have provided biometrics when required; and

(b) the applicant must be applying as a partner or child of a person (P) on the statelessness route who:

(i) has made a valid application for permission to stay in the UK on the Appendix Statelessness route that has not been decided; or

(ii) has permission to stay in the UK on the statelessness route; and

(iii) is settled or has become a British Citizen, providing P had permission to stay on the statelessness route when they settled and the applicant either had permission as their partner or child at that time, or the applicant is applying as a child of P and the applicant was born in the UK before P settled.

The second error is in the second definition of an eligible partner which fails to mirror paragraph S 11.3 (b)(iii) (above) so has the effect of excluding settled or British sponsors:

S 14.2. The applicant must be the partner of a Person (P) where one of the following applies:

(a) P has permission to stay as a Stateless person; or

(b) P is, at the same time, applying for (and is granted) permission to stay as a Stateless person;

S 14.3. The applicant must meet the requirements of Appendix Relationship with Partner of these Rules.

Conclusion

Anyone applying for family reunion under part 14 of the immigration rules should make sure that they state extremely clearly that they are applying under those rules in all the free text boxes in the application form and in a letter of representations, as otherwise their application may be be lumped into the new rules.

In the October 31 Hiran Management v NLRB decision, the 5th Circuit held that the NLRB lacks authority to award damages for “foreseeable pecuniary harms” flowing from alleged labor law violations. The decision means the Board cannot force employers in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to pay for expenses like credit-card interest, missed rent, or childcare costs that workers incur as a result of an employer’s alleged unfair labor practice. This decision follows the 3rd Circuit’s similar ruling late last year, while the 9th Circuit reached the opposite conclusion by upholding the NLRB’s broader authority to award damages. What do (even non-unionized) employers need to know about this decision – and what should you do?

NLRB Awards Employees Damages for All Foreseeable Pecuniary Harms

Hiran Management runs Hungry Like the Wolf, a Houston-based karaoke restaurant with an 80s vibe. After the owner hired a new supervisor, the non-unionized staff complained about extra duties and unkept promises of extra pay.

When tensions boiled over at a staff meeting, several employees walked out – then decided to strike and develop a list of demands. Most stayed off the schedule the next workday. The restaurant’s lawyer later invited them to a meeting to discuss concerns, but the discussions fell apart. A week later, the lawyer notified the striking workers they were no longer employed.

The Biden-era NLRB ruled the employees engaged in protected concerted activity and ordered reinstatement. It also awarded the employees full compensatory damages as a “make-whole” monetary remedy, including repayment for a wide range of “foreseeable” financial harms beyond back pay. The Board relied on its 2022 opinion called Thryv, Inc., which empowered it to compensate workers beyond backpay.

Hiran Management appealed the Board’s decision to the 5th Circuit, which issued a unanimous opinion striking down the NLRB’s authority to issue broad remedies late last week.

5th Circuit Chops Back NLRB’s Power to Award Compensatory, Non-Equitable Damages

The 5th Circuit disagreed with the NLRB’s approach – in emphatic terms. The court opened by underscoring the novelty of what the Board is trying to do:

Ninety years after Congress created the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB claimed for the first time the ability to award full compensatory damages in its enforcement proceedings. (emphasis added)

Later, the panel explained that although the National Labor Relations Act allows equitable remedies like reinstatement and backpay, it does not authorize broad consequential-damages awards, which constitute legal relief. “The Board’s remedy aims to redress concrete losses to the Employees wholly apart from backpay and pay-related costs,” the court said, “it covers harms typically dealt with in tort suits for compensatory damages, and it operates as a compensatory damages order.”

And the court warned that the NLRB would effectively have no boundaries if it were able to operate under the Thryv standard: “After Thryv, the only limit is the Board’s imagination.” In sum, the 5th Circuit said that only Congress can authorize the Board to award full compensatory damages, and it has not done so.

Why Should Non-Unionized Employers Care?

This opinion isn’t just about union shops. The NLRA protects all non-supervisory employees’ rights to act together over workplace concerns – whether or not a union is involved. In fact, the dispute here started with a walkout by non-union restaurant workers, and the Board still sought expansive financial remedies. That means everyday issues like group complaints, coordinated scheduling protests, or employees teaming up to challenge a policy can be protected under the NLRA and, if not handled correctly, can trigger potential monetary exposure.

If the NLRB’s broadened remedy power stands in some jurisdictions, even routine concerted-activity claims could carry far larger financial stakes, which could result in increased settlement pressure and litigation risks.

Where Courts Stand Now: A Growing Split

Two circuits have now rejected the NLRB’s expanded Thryv remedial scheme:

5th Circuit (this case) – covering Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi

3rd Circuit (summary here) – covering Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware

One circuit has allowed the Thryv remedial scheme:

9th Circuit – covering California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii

What’s Next?

Given this direct circuit split – on a major federal agency power question touching thousands of cases – it seems possible that the Supreme Court could step in to resolve the conflict.

Meanwhile, the NLRB remains in flux. It has been operating without an active quorum since the change in administration, and thus unable to issue decisions or set new legal precedent. While President Trump nominated two new members to the Board back in July, they have yet to be confirmed by the Senate, and the lingering government shutdown makes it difficult to predict when they could be formally installed.

Once the Board resumes operating with a quorum, we expect it to move away from Thryv and stick with its traditional forms of monetary awards (i.e., backpay). We could even see the Board issue an opinion reversing itself on the issue of damage authority. In fact, the new NLRB General Counsel issued a memo in May calling the Thryv standard into question, further signaling a change in philopshy. But Boards will swing back and forth with changes in administration and thus having a definitive word from SCOTUS about the powers of the NLRB in this area would be of massive help to the labor law community.

Practical Takeaways for Employers

✅ Expect legal uncertainty until SCOTUS weighs in

If your company has locations in multiple jurisdictions, remedies may differ depending on where a case lands. Multi-state employers should consider this when negotiating settlements with the Board.

✅ Traditional remedies still apply

The 5th Circuit’s decision does not eliminate reinstatement, backpay, or standard make-whole relief. Those remain firmly in place.

✅ Prepare for NLRB pushback

The Board may likely move away from awarding Thryv remedies, even where courts allow them.

✅ Proactive compliance matters

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who’ve spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling Down on Chemical Agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He’s regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents’ tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a Raid That Amplified Tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration’s use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn’t seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents’ accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming Elected Leaders and Activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor’s appearance.

In response, Pritzker’s office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino’s “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn’t say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 16:02:30.762893

Four Chinese immigrants who live, work, study and raise families in Florida — but claimed they were prohibited under Senate Bill 264 from buying a house — brought the suit. Multi-Choice Realty, a local real estate firm that says the law harms its business, is also a plaintiff.

But in a split ruling, the circuit judges held that none of the plaintiffs has standing to challenge the law’s purchase restriction because none of them has shown they suffered an imminent injury.

The majority wrote that the purchase restriction does not actually prevent any of them from purchasing property because they are all domiciled in Florida, not China.

Under Florida law, a person is domiciled in the state if they live “at a place” in Florida, and it does not require an intent to remain permanently to establish domicile.

“This is true even if the person does not have permanent immigration status,” U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Luck wrote in the opinion.

“As with anyone else, when a person without permanent immigration status is present in Florida and forms the intent to make Florida her permanent or indefinite home, she’s acquired domicile in Florida,” the Donald Trump appointee added.

The ruling also affirmed the denial of their request to block the law’s requirement that persons who are domiciled in China, and who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents, register real property they already own and sign an affidavit swearing they have complied with the law.

The majority determined that this requirement does not apply to the plaintiffs because all of them owned a property interest in a home before the provision took effect on July 1, 2023.

While the judges acknowledged the plaintiffs’ concerns over their future ability to purchase Florida property, they failed to establish an imminent injury because none of them showed evidence of specific plans to purchase other properties in the state.

Three of the individual plaintiffs — Yongxin Liu, Zhiming Xu and Yifan Shen — have lived in Florida for years under work visas and have already purchased at least one property. One of the plaintiffs, Xinxi Wang, is at least arguably domiciled in China, the judges wrote, because she has only a temporary student visa and, unlike the other plaintiffs, has not expressed an intention to remain indefinitely in Florida.

The purchase restriction doesn’t impair Wang’s home ownership because it was purchased before the law took effect. However, the judges found she is likely subject to the registration requirement as it is located in Miami within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure facility.

Still, the judges agreed with the lower court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion because they failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on their claims that Chinese domicile and Chinese national origin are the same thing and that the registration requirement is therefore discriminatory.

As for the real estate brokerage, Multi-Choice, the majority was also not persuaded by its claims that it will lose existing and potential customers from buying Florida property because it failed to specify any harmed clients.

Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed SB 264 into law in 2023, restricting land purchases by immigrants from “foreign countries of concern,” including China, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria, on or within 10 miles of any military installation or critical infrastructure facility in the state.

The law specifically restricts people who are domiciled in China or who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from owning any real property in Florida, regardless of location. The sole exception is that people with a valid non-tourist visa or who have been granted asylum can purchase one residential property, but only if it is less than two acres and not within five miles of a military installation.

In their suit, the plaintiffs argued the law violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Protection Clause because the purchase restriction, registration and affidavit requirements unconstitutionally discriminated against “Chinese persons” based on “race, ethnicity, color, alienage and national origin.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, a fellow Trump appointee, joined Luck in the decision. Their ruling remands the lower court that denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction to do so without prejudice as to the purchase restriction, meaning it can be tried again in the future.

But U.S. Circuit Judge Charles Wilson wrote separately to express his dissent with the majority’s “dubious equal protection and preemption analyses.”

The Bill Clinton appointee criticized the lack of scrutiny regarding states’ generalizations about their own “power” and the need for “safety” from outsiders to support discriminatory policies and classifications based on where someone is from.

He added that in his view, the plaintiffs would have likely succeeded on their federal preemption claim because Florida’s law intrudes on federal authority.

“If every state enacted its own restrictions on foreign property investment, they would weaken the President’s ability to speak to foreign nations on behalf of the United States,” Wilson wrote.

A plaintiff in the case, former UC lecturer Iliana Perez, urged the university system to take the latest court decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

A 2024 lawsuit argued that UC’s ban defied state law. In August, the First District Court of Appeals ruled that UC had not provided sufficient evidence to justify its “discriminatory policy” of not hiring students who are in the country without legal permission.

That ruling stopped short of overturning the hiring protocol, but the judges ordered UC to reconsider it using proper legal criteria. Instead, UC took the case to the state’s high court, which last week declined to hear the challenge.

Rachel Zaentz, a UC spokesperson, said in a statement Tuesday that the university system is “assessing its options” and that the court’s decision not to review the case “creates serious legal risks for the University and all other state employers in California.”

Under Trump, UC has contended with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1 billion fine over allegations including antisemitism and the illegal use of race in admission at the Los Angeles campus.

A plaintiff in the case, former UC lecturer Iliana Perez, urged the university system to take the latest court decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

“The California Supreme Court’s decision not only reaffirms that discriminating against undocumented immigrants from accessing on-campus employment cannot continue to be tolerated,” Perez said in a statement Monday to the Los Angeles Times. “But it also gives UC the clarity to finally unlock life-changing opportunities for the thousands of immigrant students who contribute to its campuses, and to the state’s economy and workforce.”

The lawsuit said that without the ability to work, students without legal status struggle to raise the money needed to afford the full cost of their education, including housing. While those students are eligible for state grants and tuition waivers, they are barred from accessing federal grants and loans. That pushes many students to find jobs under the table or in unsafe conditions, advocates have said.

UC argued that hiring students without legal status could expose campus employers to civil or criminal litigation and put at risk the billions of dollars in federal contracts the system receives.

A preliminary audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that, mostly during 2024-2025, multiple states were using the money improperly. California, the biggest culprit, spends over $1.3 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants.

We're actually clawing that money back from those states now, but the fact that that could still happen is very frustrating to all of us,"" Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told Fox Business in late October.

According to CMS, the other states and districts in question, including Illinois, spent the second most (around $30 million). Followed by Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Colorado. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-M.N., said the law prohibits this from happening.

But you know what, you didn't have the verification tools in place to enforce the law so we put the verification in the 'Working Families Tax Cut Act,' also known as the Big, Beautiful Bill,"" Emmer told Fox News Digital last month.

While federal Medicaid money is supposed to be prohibited from being used for illegal immigrants, it can be used by states for emergency treatment, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. But CMS says some Democratic-led states aren't following the law.

""Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn’t optional—it’s the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans. Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won’t tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable,"" said HHS Press Secretary Emily Hilliard.

We are clawing back that money. We have already gotten hundreds and millions of dollars back which again, proves that states were guilty, or they wouldn't give us the money back otherwise,"" Oz said.

The outcome may affect how public employers respond when staff raise concerns about workplace conduct in public forums.","Mary Joanne Deziel Timmins, who served as general counsel and litigation counsel for Colorado’s Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, alleges she was fired for raising concerns about board members’ conduct. According to her complaint, Timmins discovered that some board members were engaging in what she believed to be corrupt and potentially unlawful behavior, including holding private meetings, using personal emails for district business, and consulting with an outside attorney who was allegedly conflicted.

Timmins says she repeatedly advised the board during executive sessions that these actions could violate Colorado’s open meetings law and risk the district’s attorney-client privilege. She also claims she warned board members to stop using personal emails for official business and to preserve all relevant communications, especially given ongoing litigation.

Despite her warnings, Timmins alleges that board members continued these practices. According to the complaint, some members admitted during depositions to destroying texts and emails related to district business. After her private warnings went unheeded, Timmins says she took her concerns public – speaking at board meetings, talking to reporters, and discussing the issues with local residents. She alleges that she disclosed the board’s alleged violations, the risk to the district’s finances, and what she described as a failure by board members to distinguish between their fiduciary duties and personal interests.

Timmins was later terminated from her position. She filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming she was retaliated against for exercising her First Amendment rights. The district court dismissed her claim, holding that her speech was made pursuant to her official duties as a public employee and therefore not protected by the First Amendment.

On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed that decision. The appellate panel found that Timmins’ statements to the press and private citizens, while related to her job, were not part of her official duties as general or litigation counsel. The court emphasized that public employees do not lose First Amendment protection simply because their speech concerns their work, especially when speaking outside the chain of command. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

For HR professionals, especially in the public sector, this case highlights the boundaries between an employee’s official responsibilities and their rights as private citizens. The outcome may affect how public employers respond when staff raise concerns about workplace conduct in public forums.

The court’s decision means Timmins can pursue her claims, but her allegations have not been proven and the case is still ongoing.

The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border.","ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents’ aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who’ve spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He’s regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents’ tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration’s use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because “you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn’t seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents’ accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor’s appearance.

In response, Pritzker’s office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino’s “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn’t say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”

“So ICE went to detain her at the airport because they knew that’s where she would be.
""Immigrants that are in immigration court have a responsibility to keep their address updated, with the immigration court and with ICE,"" Armstrong said.","SALT LAKE CITY — After a woman was arrested by ICE at the Salt Lake City International Airport last Wednesday, her family is still trying to cope with the shock and are hoping things work out moving forward.

""It makes me very sad because we're human beings and we don't deserve to be treated like that,” said a close family member, too afraid to show her face or publicize her name. ""I think that we don't do anyone any harm. We just go out to earn our daily bread, to earn for our kids. We don't do anything bad, that's against the rules.""

On Thursday, ICE told FOX 13 News that the woman in the video being arrested was 39-year-old Marta Brizeyda Renderos Leiva from El Salvador. She was taken into custody last week after a deportation order from 2020.

“She is a woman who had no idea there was a removal order against her,” said Andy Armstrong, a lawyer from Stowell-Crayk working on Leiva’s case.

Leiva is a single mom to four kids who are U.S. citizens.

""She came here always with the hope that she'd have a better future and help her children advance. She's always been dedicated to her children, an exemplary mother, a good neighbor. We've never had problems with anyone,” said Leiva’s family member.

Leiva was ordered by a judge to be deported after not appearing for a court hearing. Armstrong said the notice for Leiva to appear went to an address where she hasn’t lived. She believes it was sent to the notary who helped with the immigration proceedings a couple of years ago.

""She went to this individual to help her fill out the forms, as many immigrants do, go to these services, and we believe that it was his address that was on the form as his address,” Armstrong said.

Leiva also had a valid work permit, till 2029, that was approved in 2024. Her lawyer thought she had all the documents needed, but she was flagged at the airport.

""Her name certainly popped up in an immigration database to show she had a removal order,” said Armstrong. “So ICE went to detain her at the airport because they knew that’s where she would be. Now we know they didn’t choose the airport because they just simply didn’t want to go to their house — they didn’t have a record of where her house was.”

We reached out to ICE and they said she was arrested in a targeted enforcement operation because of that deportation order and her remaining in the United States.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would have been the ones to grant the work permit, and they could not be reached for comment.

Her attorney stressed that it's up to people to make sure their details are updated to try to avoid situations like these.

""Immigrants that are in immigration court have a responsibility to keep their address updated, with the immigration court and with ICE,"" Armstrong said. ""But they have to know that they have a responsibility, and she did not know that and she never knew her case had been transferred over to ICE.""

The lawyers filed a motion to reopen Leiva's case and give her due process.

The cases on tap for the justices in December are:

Monday, Dec. 1

Cox Communications v. Sony Music Entertainment

In this case Cox Communications, Inc., one of the country’s largest internet service providers, squares off against several of the nation’s largest record companies and music publishers.

According to the underlying lawsuits, over a two-year period, 2013 and 2014, a large number of Cox’s internet subscribers used peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, such as BitTorrent, to download and distribute copyrighted songs owned by the plaintiffs.

In a bid to crack down on this activity, the Recording Industry Association of America and its affiliated record labels, hired a company called MarkMonitor to track illegal file sharing and notify internet service providers when infringement was detected.

MarkMonitor sent Cox over 163,000 notices of infringement during the relevant period.

In response, Cox instituted a so-called “thirteen-strike” policy, under which it warned or temporarily suspended subscribers after repeated notices.

The record companies maintain this policy did little to nothing to deter the behavior they wanted to stop. In fact, they noted, Cox rarely terminated service for copyright infringement, while regularly terminating service for nonpayment.

Fed up, the record companies sued Cox, alleging that the ISP was secondarily liable for copyright infringement occurring on its network.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed Cox either intentionally contributed to or benefited from its subscribers’ infringements by failing to take adequate steps to stop it, thereby inducing or materially contributing to the unlawful acts.

A federal court in Virginia denied Cox statutory safe harbor under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and allowed the case to proceed to trial on theories of vicarious and contributory copyright infringement.

The jury found Cox liable on both counts and awarded $1 billion in statutory damages.

On appeal, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the jury’s finding of willful contributory infringement, reversed the vicarious liability verdict, and vacated the damages award, remanding the case for a new trial on damages.

The justices are being asked to determine whether the 4th Circuit erred in holding that mere knowledge of another’s direct infringement suffices to find willfulness under the pertinent law, 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)?

Urias-Orellana v. Bondi, Atty. Gen.

Douglas Humberto Urias-Orellana, a Salvadoran citizen, fled to the United States with his wife and minor child after facing threats from a local hitman.

The violence began in 2016 when the hitman shot and seriously injured Urias-Orellana’s two half-brothers in separate incidents. He then vowed to kill their entire family.

Over the next several years, Urias-Orellana was repeatedly threatened at gunpoint by masked men demanding money and warning they would harm him as they did his brothers. In December 2020, he was physically assaulted in his hometown, with the attackers striking him three times in the chest.

To escape these threats, Urias-Orellana and his family relocated multiple times within El Salvador. They lived peacefully in some locations for extended periods but encountered problems when returning to areas near his hometown.

After learning that his attackers were searching for him in early 2021, the family entered the United States without authorization in June 2021. They applied for asylum based on persecution of their family group, with Urias-Orellana also seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture.

An Immigration judge denied their applications, finding the harm they said they’d experienced did not constitute persecution and that they could safely relocate within El Salvador. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.

That led to a petition for review before the 1st U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, which the court denied, upholding the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision on all claims.

The question presented to the justices is whether a federal court of appeals must defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals’s judgment that a given set of undisputed facts does not demonstrate mistreatment severe enough to constitute “persecution.”

First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, Inc. v. Platkin

This case asks the court to determine whether a religious nonprofit can challenge a state attorney general’s subpoena in federal court, or if it must first exhaust state court remedies.

The underlying litigation stems from the New Jersey attorney general’s decision to serve an investigatory subpoena on First Choice, a faith-based pregnancy center, demanding that it turn over most of its donor’s names.

First Choice challenged the subpoena under 42 U.S.C. 1983 in federal court, and the attorney general filed a subsequent suit to enforce it in state court.

The state court granted the attorney general’s motion to enforce the subpoena but expressly did not decide First Choice’s federal constitutional challenges.

The attorney general then moved in state court to sanction First Choice. Meanwhile, the district court held that First Choice’s constitutional claims were not ripe in federal court.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided per curiam decision, holding that the center could litigate its constitutional claims in state court.

In doing so, the majority followed the rule of the 5th Circuit and split from the 9th Circuit. It did not address the likely loss of a federal forum once the state court rules on the federal constitutional issues.

Olivier v. City of Brandon

Gabriel Olivier was an evangelical Christian who regularly preached in public using signs and loudspeakers to convey religious messages.

Beginning in 2018, one of his favorite places to evangelize was the sidewalk outside the Brandon Amphitheater, a city-owned venue in Brandon, Mississippi.

But in 2019, the city enacted an ordinance requiring protestors during live events to remain in a designated protest area, restricting use of loudspeakers and prohibiting non-handheld signs.

In May 2021, Olivier returned to the Amphitheater during a concert to preach and was ordered by the police chief to move to the protest area.

Olivier left, but returned a short time later, and was given a citation for violating the ordinance. He pleaded no contest in municipal court, paid a fine, and did not appeal the conviction.

A short time later, Olivier filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, seeking damages and an injunction to prevent future enforcement of the ordinance.

In doing so, he said it violated his First and 14th Amendment rights.

The district court held that his claims were barred by the doctrine established in Heck v. Humphrey because success on them would necessarily undermine his prior conviction.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, modifying the dismissal to be with prejudice only until the conditions set by Heck were met.

The issue has created a split between the circuit courts.

Trump, President of the United States v. Slaughter

Rebecca Kelly Slaughter was serving as a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, when President Donald Trump fired her and explained his decision was based on his belief her continued service was “inconsistent with [the] administration’s priorities.”

This reason violated the standard for dismissal under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which limits the president’s ability to remove an FTC commissioner to “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Slaughter sued Trump and the three remaining FTC Commissioners, arguing her removal was unlawful because the president failed to offer a valid statutory cause.

The district court ruled in favor of Slaughter, declaring her removal unlawful, ordering her reinstatement, and issuing a permanent injunction against the remaining commissioners and their subordinates, barring them from interfering with her duties.

The administration appealed the decision and requested a stay of the district court’s order pending the appeal.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal and dissolved an administrative stay that had been previously entered.

The Supreme Court granted the stay in September, at the same time it said it would hear the case on an expedited basis.

The justices will decide whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers.

At the same time, they’ve been asked to consider whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.

NRSC V. FEC

This dispute began three years ago when two Republican party committees joined then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and then-Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, in suing the Federal Election Commission.

In their complaint, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee claimed the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 unconstitutionally restricts their ability to coordinate campaign advertising with their own candidates.

They said such coordination is crucial to enabling the party and its candidates to unify their political message and spend money more efficiently.

While the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2001 case FEC v. Colorado upheld this limit, they argue that subsequent events have rendered that ruling obsolete and say it should be overturned.

Specifically, they cite changes in campaign finance law, the rise of “Super PACs,” and shifts in the Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence as factors supporting their position.

Following the act’s rule for constitutional challenges, a federal judge in Ohio certified the question and sent it on to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard the case en banc.

The 6th Circuit held that the act’s limits on coordinated campaign expenditures do not violate the First Amendment. The justices have been tasked with deciding whether the 6th Circuit got it right.

Hamm v. Smith

Joseph Clifton Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama. However, years later, he filed a federal habeas corpus petition, seeking to overturn his death sentence on grounds that he is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed under the Eighth and 14th Amendments.

The critical issue presented by his petition was whether he met the well-established three-prong test for intellectual disability.

These are whether he exhibited:

Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

Significant deficits in adaptive behavior, and

The manifestation of these qualities before age 18.

Smith was subjected to multiple IQ tests that revealed scores ranging from 72 to 78 — all within or near the range associated with intellectual disability when the standard error of measurement was taken into account.

After extensive evidentiary hearings featuring competing expert testimony about both Smith’s IQ scores and his adaptive functioning deficits, a federal judge found Smith intellectually disabled, and the court vacated his death sentence.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case, asking the appellate to clarify whether its ruling relied solely on the lower end of Smith’s IQ score range or on a broader analysis of all evidence.

On remand, the 11th Circuit explained that it based its decision on the latter, and that it believed it found “consistent evidence” that Smith “may” qualify as mildly disabled.

The Supreme Court will consider whether courts evaluating multiple IQ scores must find that every valid score of “about” 75 or less supports a so-called “Atkins claim.”

An Atkins claim is a legal argument made by a defendant in a capital case that they have an intellectual disability and cannot be sentenced to death because of the Supreme Court’s 2002 ruling in Atkins v. Virginia.

The claim is based on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The Atkins decision established that executing individuals with intellectual disabilities is unconstitutional.

FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund

Investment vehicles organized as closed-end mutual funds under Maryland law adopted so-called “control share provisions” that stripped voting rights from shareholders who owned 10% or more of a fund’s shares.

These provisions were adopted in response to an activist investor, Saba Capital, which had been acquiring large positions in underperforming closed-end funds.

Saba Capital’s investment strategy was predicated on creating greater shareholder value by electing new directors who would then advocate for share buybacks.

In order to fulfill this strategy, Saba Capital sued 16 closed-end funds in June 2023, seeking rescission of these control share provisions.

It argued in its complaint that the provisions violated the Investment Company Act, which requires that “every share of stock shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding stock.”

A federal judge in New York granted summary judgment in favor of Saba against eleven of the funds, dismissing five of the cases due to forum selection clauses requiring that lawsuits be filed in Maryland.

In doing so the court said control share provisions violated the ICA’s equal voting rights mandate. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed the decision.

With that ruling, appellate courts have now split 2-1 over whether Congress created an implied private right of action in Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act.

The 3rd and 9th Circuits, relying on statutory text and structure, have held that Section 47(b) does not create an implied private right of action, and a panel of the 4th Circuit has agreed in an unpublished opinion.

Only the 2nd Circuit — where plaintiffs may be able to sue most investment funds subject to the ICA, given New York’s and the New York Stock Exchange’s roles in financial operations — has held the opposite view, based on an “inference”: parties may bring a lawsuit under Section 47(b), even though Congress never said so.

The question presented to the justices is whether Section 47(b) of the act, creates an implied private right of action.

The Statue of Liberty welcomes new Americans who are yearning for freedom, no matter where they come from or the color of their skin. The Trump administration wants to change that.

The administration is reportedly(link is external) overhauling the U.S. refugee system to place English speakers, white South Africans and Europeans at the front of the line. Gutting the refugee program—at a time when violence across the world is reaching the highest levels(link is external) since World War II—is a choice that will inevitably endanger millions of people.

In other words, President Donald Trump wants to rewrite the message at the base of the Statue of Liberty to say: “White people only.”

This betrays everything America stands for.

Since its founding, the United States has provided refuge for people fleeing violence and persecution. Our country has been built by immigrants, refugees, dreamers and fighters—people who came here driven by hope and the belief that a better life was possible.

For many in our community, the refugee program was a lifeline. Thousands of Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian and Burmese refugees sacrificed everything to reach America’s shores. They did not choose to leave their homes. They were forced to—escaping with just the clothes on their backs and the courage to rebuild their lives in a foreign land.

Yet these refugees never lost faith in the promise of America. Despite the language barriers, cultural differences and economic hardships, they carried an unbreakable spirit and refused to be defined by what they had lost. Instead, they defined themselves by the opportunities America presented, opening businesses, serving in our military and working tirelessly to build a better future for their families. Their contributions can be seen in every corner of society today.

This is the American dream come to life.

To suggest that some refugees are more “deserving” of safety and opportunity is to erase the contributions of millions of refugees who have given back to America many times over.

This is coming from the same administration that wants to end birthright citizenship, a constitutionally protected right that has been upheld by the Supreme Court for over a century. Birthright citizenship is one of the most common pathways for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to become U.S. citizens. It is how I, the daughter of immigrants, became a U.S. citizen and now serve in the halls of Congress.

But now these immigration pathways are under attack via a coordinated effort to redefine who counts as an American. And make no mistake: these decisions will have far-reaching consequences for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, 65 percent(link is external) of whom were born outside this country.

We have gone down this troubling path before. The administration’s actions harken back to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, when Chinese immigrants were banned from entering the United States and those living in the U.S. were denied citizenship. It set a precedent to further restrict immigration for other Asians seeking entry into our country, including for Japanese, Koreans and Filipinos.

This is not the America our parents and grandparents dreamt of.

We cannot let the Trump administration redefine who gets to be American. We cannot let them erase decades of sacrifice and success from refugees who have strengthened this country.

It is our duty to preserve the America that welcomed our families with open arms. That promise is still alive, and we must live up to it.",https://capac.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 12:05:17.173118

Therefore, the brief contends, Trump must comply with the restrictions that the Trade Act imposes, which limits tariffs to 15% and 150 days.
The history of U.S. trade law is at the center of many of the briefs filed with the court.
“The notion that Congress delegated the power to impose unbounded, devastating tariffs that could completely restructure international relations through the phrase ‘regulate .
Trump’s executive orders imposing the tariffs, the group says, are contrary to that intent.","Certain briefs concentrate on the text of IEEPA.

A brief on behalf of a group of 207 members of Congress (including Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) tells the justices that IEEPA does not give the president the power to impose the tariffs. The Trump administration’s “interpretation of IEEPA,” they say, “would effectively nullify the guardrails set forth in every statute in which Congress expressly granted the President limited tariff authority—a result Congress did not intend.”

A brief from Jill Homan, the deputy director of the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit conservative think tank, argues the opposite: that IEEPA gives the president power to impose tariffs. Specifically, Homan contends that Congress’ grant to the president in IEEPA the power to “regulate … importation” “includes the power to impose tariffs because tariffs have been used throughout American history as a common tool for regulating commerce, and they have been imposed specifically on imported goods.” But in any event, she continues, the Supreme Court should interpret the phrase “regulate … importation” expansively in light of the larger context of IEEPA, which “include[s] broad, sweeping powers.”

A brief from BRB Management, which describes itself as “a small business that operates retail stores directly affected by tariffs and related trade policies,” focuses on a different part of IEEPA: its grant of authority only to “regulate … importation” of “any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” The company contends that at the point where tariffs are imposed on goods, they generally are owned by U.S. buyers – and therefore are not owned by foreign countries or foreign citizens.

Other briefs focus on different laws that, they say, could justify the tariffs.

America First Policy Institute, which describes itself as “a non-profit, non-partisan research institute” dedicated to putting “the American people first,” tells the justices that the president has the power under a different law – the Tariff Act of 1930 – to impose the tariffs at the center of this case. Section 338 of that law, the group explains, gives the president the power to impose tariffs of up to 50% if he determines “that any foreign country places any burden or disadvantage” on U.S. commerce “directly or indirectly, by law or administrative regulation or practice, by or in respect to any customs, … charge, exaction, classification, regulation, condition, restriction, or prohibition.” And it doesn’t matter, the group says, that Trump did not rely on this provision in his executive orders imposing the tariffs.

Erica Hashimoto, the director of the Georgetown University Law Center’s Appellate Litigation Clinic, filed a brief on behalf of a group of trade scholars arguing that a different trade law – Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – applies to the tariffs at issue in this case. Congress passed that law (and not IEEPA) to give the power the president to deal with trade deficits, the brief says. Therefore, the brief contends, Trump must comply with the restrictions that the Trade Act imposes, which limits tariffs to 15% and 150 days.

The history of U.S. trade law is at the center of many of the briefs filed with the court.

A brief on behalf of a group of former national and economic security officials argues that IEEPA does not give the president the power that he claims to impose these tariffs. Instead, the officials contend, “IEEPA continued (but narrowed) the authority that its predecessor, the [Trading with the Enemy Act], granted the President to impose sanctions and embargoes,” and presidents for almost 50 years have interpreted it as such. If the court upholds the tariffs, the officials say, it would “risk[] undermining the ability of this President and future Presidents to use IEEPA, as Congress intended, to address foreign policy crises.”

Carla Anderson Hills, who served as the U.S. Trade Representative during the George H.W. Bush administration, and Alan William Wolff, an international trade lawyer who has served in senior roles in the federal government, tell the justices that Trump’s use of IEEPA “as a means for correcting trade deficits conflicts with “the United States’ systematic and unbroken practice of implementing trade laws since the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.” Because it is not clear whether IEEPA gives the president the power to impose the tariffs, they argue, that practice should “carry substantial weight.” Of note, Hills and Wolff are represented by Roderick M. Hills, Jr., a professor at New York University’s law school and the son of Carla Anderson Hills.

Aditya Bamzai, a law professor at the University of Virginia Law School, filed a brief in support of neither party in which he argues that Congress enacted the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor to IEEPA, against a backdrop in which “the use of a ‘tax’ or ‘fee’ was an appropriate method to regulate trade with the enemy under the classic laws of war.” And when Congress passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law on which Trump relied in imposing the tariffs, it included the same phrase – “regulate … importation” – found in IEEPA. Therefore, he writes, “that language is best read to have the same meaning that it had when used in the TWEA before the passage of the IEEPA.”

The Constitutional Accountability Center, which describes itself in the brief as “a think tank and public interest law firm dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of the Constitution’s text and history,” contends that Congress’ enactment of IEEPA “reflects a deliberate severing of peacetime emergency powers from their war powers origins,” “undermining any inference that Congress silently included the extraordinary power to impose tariffs within IEEPA’s regulatory authorities.”

A group of tax law professors argues that Congress, rather than the president, should determine tariffs. This conclusion, they say in their brief, is supported by early U.S. history. The Framers of the Constitution believed that duties on imports were likely to be an important source of revenue for the new country, and they designed the Constitution so that “divisive questions” like “taxation and foreign imports” “would be settled by a large, representative, and deliberative legislature—not by a single Executive.”

The Cato Institute, which describes itself in its brief as “a nonpartisan public-policy research foundation … dedicated to advancing the principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government,”points to history to argue that “Congress knows how to give the President discretion—within limits—to modify tariff rates.” Moreover, Cato contends, whatever the phrase “regulate … importation” might have meant in the context of the Trading With the Enemy Act, “the historical record and this Court’s separation of powers precedents” suggest that in IEEPA Congress did not intend to give the president the power to impose tariffs in peacetime.

Several briefs focus on whether the tariffs violate either the “major questions” doctrine – the idea that if Congress wants to give the executive branch the power to make decisions of vast economic or political significance, it must say so explicitly – or the nondelegation doctrine, the idea that Congress generally cannot delegate its lawmaking powers.

The state of California and Gov. Gavin Newsom argue that nothing about the text, context, or history of IEEPA gives any sign that Congress intended to give the president the power to impose tariffs. This conclusion is also supported by the major questions doctrine, they say in their brief. “The notion that Congress delegated the power to impose unbounded, devastating tariffs that could completely restructure international relations through the phrase ‘regulate . . . importation,’ in the context of a list of seven other verbs and eleven other objects, cannot be squared with the major-questions doctrine (or any other interpretive principle).”

A brief on behalf of 31 former federal judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents argues first that if the president did have the power under IEEPA to impose the tariffs it would violate the nondelegation doctrine because the law does not provide the president with any standards to guide him. Moreover, the judges say, courts can review the president’s determination that there is an “unusual and extraordinary” threat that triggers IEEPA. That, they contend, “is a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation” and “the type of determination that federal judges make every day.”

A group of nonprofits and academics, led by Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, tells the justices that if IEEPA does give the president the power to impose these tariffs, “it would violate the nondelegation doctrine because … IEEPA does not contain an intelligible principle to guide either the President’s declaration of an emergency or his implementation of tariffs.”

A brief in support of the Trump administration from the American Center for Law and Justice, which describes itself as “an organization dedicated to the defense of constitutional liberties secured by law,” emphasizes that, under the Constitution, the president has primary responsibility for foreign affairs. In IEEPA, the ACLJ writes, Congress gave the president broad emergency power, reflecting its “recognition that international economic crises require rapid, coordinated responses that only unified executive action can provide.” And the major questions doctrine does not apply in this case, the group says, because “foreign affairs present fundamentally different considerations” from the kinds of cases involving “domestic regulatory overreach by unelected administrators” that the doctrine was designed to address.

Consumer Watchdog, a group that describes itself as a “non-profit, non-partisan public interest organization dedicated to protecting consumers from economic harm,” argues that Trump’s tariffs violate the nondelegation doctrine. Trump, the group says, contends “that IEEPA silently gives him” “immense power.” But the tariffs are not linked to “any limits or conditions in IEEPA – and everything determined by the unfettered choices of the President.” That, the group says, runs afoul of the requirement that, if Congress delegates its authority, it must provide an “intelligible principle” to guide the exercise of that authority.

Some briefs focus on, among other things, where the challenges to the tariffs should be filed.

A brief supporting the Trump administration from two members of Congress – Reps. Darrell Issa and Brian Mast – as well as America First Legal Foundation, a nonprofit law firm co-founded by Stephen Miller, and the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which describes itself as “the only national non-profit organization representing exclusively domestic producers across many sectors and industries of the U.S. economy,” argues that the court should issue its decision in the case brought by V.O.S. Selections, rather than Learning Resources. This is so, the brief argues, because IEEPA “authorizes embargoes for reasons other than public safety” – which brings lawsuits arising out of IEEPA under the purview of the Court of International Trade.

A brief filed on behalf of several small businesses, led by Emily Ley Paper, that are challenging the tariffs in their own litigation, as well as the New Civil Liberties Alliance, argues that the text of IEEPA is clear, and it does not give the president the authority that he claims to impose tariffs. Because IEEPA does not address tariffs, the brief continues, the district court in Washington – rather than the Court of International Trade – has the power to hear the disputes over the tariffs.

Some briefs supporting the challengers touch on the effects (or lack thereof) of the court’s decision.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Consumer Technology Association state that, as a result of the tariffs, “businesses have been forced to raise prices, freeze hiring, and postpone investments”; moreover, they add, “for all businesses and investors, the President’s claimed authority to impose, modify, pause, and remove tariffs under IEEPA at the drop of a hat is resulting in chaos and uncertainty.” Finally, they warn that if the court upholds the president’s authority, future administrations “will have similarly expansive authority to impose worldwide tariffs based on their own objectives.”

A brief on behalf of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, which describes itself as “a non-partisan research and educational organization dedicated to showing Americans how taxes, government spending, and regulations affect everyday life,” focuses largely on the facts underlying the case and the effects of a ruling for the challengers. The group contends that “trade deficits are not a sudden or unexpected development, and are in fact a routine and ordinary event, the opposite of an emergency. The U.S. has run trade deficits continually for 49 years.” Moreover, the group add, a ruling from the Supreme Court that strikes down the tariffs would not be “catastrophic,” as the government has suggested, but would instead “simply return us to the comparatively low level of tariffs that were in place at the start of the year.”

A group of government officials, legislators, labor unions, and businesses from Washington partly focus in their brief on the effects of the tariffs (as well as the uncertainty surrounding them) on the state. Among other things, they note, “Washington’s economy is projected to suffer a net loss of $8.1 billion in output sales between 2025 and 2029,” and the state could lose as many as 32,000 jobs. “Should the President’s tariffs remain in place,” they write, “Washingtonians will see higher prices for food (16% higher cumulatively over two years); higher prices for clothes and shoes (around 7% in the next year); and higher prices for cars (a 20-25% rise for used cars over two years and a 6% rise for new cars).”

A brief from the American Watch Association, the U.S. trade association for the watch industry, tells the justices about the effects of the tariffs on the industry. It explains that “watchmaking is a globally integrated industry that depends upon longstanding specialty manufacturers abroad” – and in particular, in Switzerland and Japan – “for essential watch components” that cannot be obtained in the United States. As a result, the group says, the industry’s costs have increased, and members of the trade association “are already being forced to lay off employees, close storefronts, or increase consumer prices.” Moreover, they add, because of “the unusually high startup costs for precision manufacturing, there is no realistic prospect that the President’s tariff program will spur the creation of new manufacturing jobs in the United States.”

Several briefs address other arguments related to trade law and the president’s power.

A brief filed on behalf of former federal judges, government officials, and members of Congress argues that when Congress wants to give the president the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly. But in any event, the brief continues, the president cannot rely on IEEPA to impose tariffs to address trade deficits because “trade imbalances that have persisted every year since IEEPA was enacted in 1977 cannot count as an ‘unusual and extraordinary threat.’”

A brief on behalf of 13 former U.S. military, national security, and foreign policy officials argues that federal courts can and should review whether the president has properly invoked the National Emergencies Act and IEEPA. And here, the officials contend, he has not done so: although Trump invoked “the alleged threats posed by the trade deficit and lack of international cooperation on opioid trafficking,” “these are persistent, longstanding issues, not ‘unusual and extraordinary’ threats.”

A brief on behalf of a wide-ranging group that includes constitutional scholars, legal historians, and former U.S. senators urges the court to “reaffirm the basic principle that Congress, not the President, holds the power to tax and to make major trade policy. Emergencies,” the group writes, “do not erase that principle, and the government cannot through the back door smuggle tariff authority into a statute that deliberately does not authorize it by invoking ‘foreign affairs’ or imagining the power to ‘regulate’ as including the power to tax.”

Law professor Vikram Amar and former member of Congress Mickey Edwards argue that when Congress delegates broad power to the president, it can be difficult for Congress to reclaim that power because the president can veto any legislation that Congress passes to do so. Courts should keep this in mind, Amar and Edwards contend, when determining whether – as in this case – a law delegates the kind of expansive powers that the president has claimed, and instead should read IEEPA narrowly. If the Supreme Court is wrong, they say, “there is a relatively easy fix: Congress can pass a new bill by simple majority and the President will almost certainly sign it into law.”

The Brennan Center for Justice, which describes itself as an “an independent, nonpartisan law and policy organization,” contends that the National Emergencies Act, a 1976 law that governs the president’s exercise of emergency powers, and IEEPA were intended to limit the president’s use of emergency powers. Trump’s executive orders imposing the tariffs, the group says, are contrary to that intent.

A brief on behalf of the Goldwater Institute, the Dallas Market Center, and the John Locke Foundation argues first that the Supreme Court “has both the authority and the duty to determine independently whether there actually is an emergency” that would trigger the president’s powers under IEEPA. But there is no such emergency here, the brief says.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-04 12:05:56.570237

Lauren Boebert at a Halloween party has drawn criticism over the Colorado congresswoman’s Mexican-themed costume, which included a sombrero, a dress and a sign that made light of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
Tell me if juicy ICE coming,” an apparent pun on “Tell me if you see ICE coming.” ICE is an acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The 4th District also includes populous Douglas County.
Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat who lost to Boebert last fall for the 4th District seat and is running again to represent the district in 2026, condemned the congresswoman over the weekend.
“Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District,” Calvarese said on X.","A photo of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert at a Halloween party has drawn criticism over the Colorado congresswoman’s Mexican-themed costume, which included a sombrero, a dress and a sign that made light of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The photo was circulated on social media over the weekend. The Republican is dressed in what appears to be a traditional Mexican outfit, of sorts, and is holding a sign with a message that uses a racist play on words invoking a stereotyped Mexican accent.

The sign reads: “Mexican Word of the Day: Juicy. Tell me if juicy ICE coming,” an apparent pun on “Tell me if you see ICE coming.” ICE is an acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Standing near her in the photo is a man dressed as an ICE agent.

The costume drew condemnation from Latino advocacy groups in Colorado.

“She should be ashamed of herself,” said Stacy Suniga, the president of the Latino Coalition of Weld County. “Though I believe she is incapable of any emotion that generates human decency. Her bigotry and ignorance are clearly evident in her chosen apparel this day.”

Boebert represents a part of Weld County in the 4th Congressional District. According to the Colorado Redistricting Commission, the ruby red Eastern Plains-centered district was at least 14% or so Latino as of the 2020 census — having the lowest Latino representation among the state’s eight congressional districts. The 4th District also includes populous Douglas County.

Boebert has generated headlines before for charged commentary and personal behavior that has proven embarrassing — enough to where she apologized for her words and actions.

Not this time. When asked about the Halloween photo, Boebert said through a spokesperson that “it’s a Halloween costume.”

She did not answer several questions put to her office by The Denver Post about the photo, instead lambasting Democrats for repeatedly voting against a short-term spending bill, called a continuing resolution, that would end the federal government shutdown.

“Tell our Senators to vote for the CR and open the government,” she said. “They are choosing to let millions of American families suffer.”

Four years ago, Boebert apologized after a video circulated on X, the social media platform then known as Twitter, of her implying that Rep. Ilhan Omar, a fellow member of Congress and a Muslim, could be a suicide bomber. She also apologized for her behavior during a performance of the “Beetlejuice” musical in Denver in September 2023, when she was caught vaping, groping her date and flipping off Buell Theatre staff after they asked her to leave.

Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat who lost to Boebert last fall for the 4th District seat and is running again to represent the district in 2026, condemned the congresswoman over the weekend.

“Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District,” Calvarese said on X.

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, co-chair of the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus, called on Boebert to apologize and said she “should know that our culture is not a costume and being bilingual is an asset, not a joke.”

“The Latino Caucus was made aware of the photo on Saturday and members were outraged,” Gonzales wrote to The Post on Monday. “We immediately began conversations within our caucus of how we wanted to respond. … Congresswoman Boebert chose to mock our community, co-opt our culture, and make a sick joke while immigrant Coloradans with lawful immigration status in her own district, such as fifth-grade teacher Marina Ortiz, are being detained by ICE after doing everything that has been asked of them.”

She was referring to an incident late last month in which Ortiz, who teaches at Global Village Academy in Parker, was detained along with her family during a check-in appointment at an ICE field office. The school said she had legal authorization to live and work in the United States.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-Z-boebert-halloween-01.jpg?w=1024&h=1027,N,,2025-11-04 13:02:25.768126

In labor news, several major U.S. companies have announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of workers. Amazon said it would eliminate about 14,000 corporate jobs, with Reuters reporting that number could more than double, as artificial intelligence tools increasingly replace white-collar workers. Meanwhile, Target announced plans to cut 1,800 corporate jobs, General Motors said it’s cutting over 3,300 electric vehicle jobs, and Paramount began laying off 2,000 workers following the media conglomerate’s merger with Skydance. Meanwhile, shipping giant UPS said it had eliminated some 48,000 jobs this year. Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the second consecutive meeting, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of a weakening labor market. The Fed’s decision came in the absence of key data on inflation and employment due to the government shutdown.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney has died at the age of 84. Beginning in 1978, Cheney served six terms as Wyoming’s lone U.S. congressmember, where he voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa and against a holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He left Congress in 1989 to serve as defense secretary under President George H.W. Bush, overseeing the first Gulf War and the bloody U.S. invasion of Panama that deposed leader and former U.S. ally Manuel Noriega, while killing hundreds of people. From 1995 to 2000, Cheney served as chair and CEO of the oil services company Halliburton, before George W. Bush tapped him as his running mate. As vice president, Cheney was a key architect of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq under the false pretext of preventing Saddam Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction. The invasion led to more than 650,000 deaths, according to a study by The Lancet. As the occupation of Iraq foundered, Cheney argued for the “Salvador option” of using death squads similar to U.S.-supported paramilitaries in El Salvador and other Central American countries in the 1980s. Dick Cheney steadfastly defended the use of torture against detainees of the so-called war on terror. This is Cheney speaking to “Meet the Press” just days after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

Vice President Dick Cheney: “We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will. We’ve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we’re going to be successful.”

We’ll have more on Vice President Dick Cheney’s life and legacy later in the broadcast.

In Sudan, the U.N.'s migration agency says more than 36,000 people have fled El Fasher since the city was seized by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces last week, after 18 months under siege. Displaced families were forced to walk to the neighboring town of Tawila, which is already sheltering more than 650,000 people forced out of their homes. Survivors described streets littered with corpses and families separated by violence, with those displaced forced to trek for days without food or water. This comes as famine grips El Fasher and the town of Kadugli, according to a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world's leading authority on food crises. Famine is also threatening to spread to 20 other areas in the Darfur region and central Sudan’s Kordofan region, as fighting between the Sudanese government and the RSF rages on. Meanwhile, the RSF has vowed to take over the city of el-Obeid in central Sudan, currently under control by the Sudanese army.

Israel is continuing to intensify its attacks across Gaza, further violating the U.S.-brokered truce that went into effect on October 10. Al Jazeera reports Israeli forces have demolished homes and residential buildings in Gaza City as Palestinian families still don’t have access to enough food, clean water, medicines or safe shelter with winter approaching. There are an estimated 75,000 displaced people sheltering in overcrowded UNRWA-run buildings, damaged by Israeli attacks, while tens of thousands of others are living in makeshift refugee camps in Gaza or amid the rubble of what was once their homes. This is a displaced Palestinian man in Khan Younis.

Ehab Hussein: “Today the basic necessities aren’t available. Meat isn’t available, and chicken isn’t, either. As for the situation of vegetables, today it’s unpredictable. Sometimes prices go up, sometimes they go down. The situation is hard. We can’t bear it. We’re living in tents. All our lives we’ve prayed for winter rain, but today we hope winter doesn’t come, because we will be humiliated in tents.”

Israel has released the bodies of another 45 Palestinians after Hamas returned the remains of three Israeli soldiers. As of Monday, Israel has handed over the bodies of at least 270 Palestinians since the U.S.-backed Gaza deal went into effect last month. Israel has also released another five Palestinians in Israeli prison custody; the men were taken to Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah for medical care. Many of the bodies and Palestinian captives released by Israel show signs of torture and abuse. It is estimated that Israel still holds the remains of about 1,500 Palestinians from Gaza.

This all comes as fallout continues following the arrest of a former top lawyer of the Israeli military for her role in the leak of surveillance video that showed Israeli soldiers gang-raping a Palestinian prisoner at the Sde Teiman prison last year. Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested on Sunday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called Israel’s worst PR attack in its history. He’s yet to condemn the rape of the Palestinian prisoner.

In Southern California, advocates are raising more alarm over ICE’s use of force in immigration raids, after agents shot a 25-year-old U.S. citizen in the Los Angeles area as he attempted to warn the federal officers that children would soon gather at a school bus stop where the officers had just pulled over a vehicle. Lawyers for Carlos Jimenez said he was shot while trying to leave the scene and reversed his car in panic. A bullet remains lodged in the back of his right shoulder. Jimenez was then arrested, accused of assaulting an officer, which his lawyers deny. He was released from jail on bond last week as he faces federal charges. The shooting came about a week after ICE agents shot a Mexican immigrant they were attempting to arrest during a botched operation in L.A. late last month.

In more immigration news, two separate courts have ordered the Trump administration not to deport a man who spent 43 years in a Pennsylvania prison for a crime he did not commit. On October 3, 64-year-old Subramanyam Vedam walked free from Huntingdon State Correctional Institution, where he’d been held for over four decades, after his conviction for a 1982 murder was vacated. His freedom came three years after the Pennsylvania Innocence Project uncovered evidence that prosecutors had buried an FBI report that would have exonerated him. He was immediately arrested by ICE agents. Vedam is currently detained at an ICE jail in Alexandria, Louisiana. Vedam came to the U.S. from India with his parents when he was just 9 months old.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/71/79671/full_hd/hd1-Mamdani-Trump-Cuomo.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 13:57:37.578877

Civil rights and immigration advocacy groups sought to make permanent a District of Columbia District Court’s July injunction that found the Trump administration could not block asylum seekers from making asylum claims — a form of protection extended to those fearing persecution.

A separate appeals panel lifted the lower court’s order, permitting the administration to block asylum seekers while the merits of the case were argued.

The Trump administration cited the 212(f) proclamation and claimed that because there is an “invasion” at the southern border, asylum protections – which were created by Congress – could be denied. The 212(f) proclamation gives the president the authority to suspend entry of migrants under certain circumstances.

Encounters with migrants at the southern border have remained the lowest in years.

Immigration crackdown

The executive order from January fell in line with the president’s immigration crackdown, as he aims to limit immigration in the interior of the country with mass deportations and cease migration to the United States through curbing access to asylum and refugee resettlement.

During Monday’s oral arguments, Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argued that Trump has the authority to decide who is admissible into the country, regardless if it’s an asylum claim.

The suit was brought on behalf of three organizations by the American Civil Liberties Union, National Immigrant Justice Center, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, Texas Civil Rights Project, ACLU of the District of Columbia and ACLU of Texas.

Those three organizations are the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. They provide legal services to people seeking asylum and argued that they are unable to do so under Trump’s proclamation.

The judges on the panel included Cornelia T.L. Pillard, Justin R. Walker and J. Michelle Childs.

Former President Barack Obama nominated Pillard and former President Joe Biden nominated Childs. President Donald Trump nominated Walker during his first term.

Trump executive powers

Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said the president’s proclamation was an extension of his executive branch powers.

Ensign argued that the Trump administration views asylum as discretionary, and that the president can “take the steps necessary to make an entry bar effective, including defining consequences for violating it.”

Ensign argued that because the appeals court this summer allowed for the district court’s order to be paused, it means the government is likely to prevail on its argument.

Lee Gelernt of the ACLU argued that the proclamation’s use of 212(f) cannot override asylum law in the Immigration Nationality Act that Congress passed.

“This is an internally coherent statute which Congress has put together the pieces,” Gelernt said of the INA. “And what’s ultimately happening here is that the administration doesn’t like the way Congress has put together the pieces.”

He added that Congress was specific in describing a migrant who would not be allowed to qualify for asylum, such as someone who has ties to terrorism.

“But 212(f) itself cannot override asylum,” Gelernt said.

Ensign also asked the panel of judges, if they decide to allow the lower court’s injunction to go into effect, to give the Trump administration at least two weeks to implement the new policy at the southern border.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/miamitimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/11/61171431-caf0-4740-b25c-80bad2150ff5/686c19620c0f3.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-04 15:01:37.950341

One in four arrests nationwide have taken place in Texas, and the state’s numbers have nearly doubled since President Donald Trump returned to office, outpacing every other state, according to new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained by the Texas Tribune.

Workplace raids on the rise under Trump admin

While Texas is home to the nation’s second-largest undocumented population — more than 1.6 million people of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — immigration attorneys argue local jails have become a direct pipeline to ICE custody.

Under Trump, 60% of detainees have no prior convictions, a sharp rise from the Biden era, and more than half were taken directly from local jails.

David A. Katz, a former assistant U.S. attorney, argued the Trump administration is not focusing on criminals.

“There’s just a focus on undocumented people in general, and that’s why we’ve seen the workplace raids. We’ve seen all of that sort of thing,” Katz said. “He’s gone after the people who are just working for a living, who are here, albeit illegally.”

Attorneys have argued that shift in enforcement priority — from targeting violent offenders to sweeping up non-criminal immigrants — is driving arrest numbers higher in states like Texas and could stretch beyond immigration into voter behavior.

ICE: No plans to target polling sites

In states such as California and New Jersey, immigration advocates say fear of ICE near polling places is keeping some Latino voters home.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of “rolling out enforcement around Election Day.”

“You’ll see that all across this country. I don’t think this; I know this, because we were in those conversations,” Newsom said. “You’re also going to see ICE deployed. You’re going to see these masked men from border patrol also near voting booths and polling places.”

ICE has denied those claims, arguing operations are “intelligence-driven” and that it has no plans to target polling locations.

Katie Hobbs for records regarding her office reportedly ordering state police and the Arizona National Guard to withhold cooperation from federal immigration enforcement authorities (Judicial Watch Inc. v. Office of the Arizona Governor (No. CV2025-039217)).

The lawsuit was filed in Maricopa County Superior Court following the governor’s office’s “no responsive records” response to a December 17, 2024, records request. The request specifically sought:

Any communications, memos, or orders issued to state agencies reflecting a policy of non-participation in federal immigration enforcement;

Documentation of any legal analyses or contemplated litigation related to the governor’s stance on state-level involvement in immigration law enforcement.

Arizona law states: “No official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may limit or restrict the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.”

In November 2024, Hobbs responded to a question on whether Arizona’s state police and National Guard would assist with federal immigration enforcement efforts by stating, “What I will unequivocally say is that, as governor, I will not tolerate efforts that are part of misguided policies that harm our communities, that threaten our communities, that terrorize our communities, and Arizona will not take part in those…. We will not be participating in misguided efforts that harm our communities, and I’ve been incredibly clear about that.”

Federal supremacy in immigration matters is established by the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause and codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act in Title 8 of the U.S. Code. These provisions reserve exclusive authority to the federal government for the regulation of admission, removal, and enforcement of immigration laws.

“Governor Hobbs’ apparent refusal to allow state resources to support lawful immigration operations undermines the rule of law and places law enforcement and other innocent lives at risk,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

The submission – from National Partnership for New Americans, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Detention Watch Network, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Latin America Working Group, and others – emphasizes that the first Trump administration’s signature trade deal did not fix rules in NAFTA that destroyed livelihoods, contributing to forced displacement of millions and mass migration.

Together, the groups note that the USMCA review coincides with a troubling escalation in the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant campaign, marked by mass deportations, expanded detention, and militarized enforcement, which ignores how U.S. economic policies have contributed to migration pressures.

The comments outline key recommendations to transform the USMCA, including:

Replacing corporate-dominated advisory committees with a transparent process that centers the voices of migrant, frontline, and labor communities.

Strengthening workers’ rights and their enforcement, including for migrant workers.

Affirming governments’ right to protect small farmers, regulate investment, and ensure food security.

Removing Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and other corporate privileges that undermine labor and environmental safeguards.

Quotes from signatory organizations:

“As a national network of immigrant and refugee rights organizations, NPNA is proud to support the call for a trade framework that upholds the dignity and rights of workers, families, and communities across borders. For too long, trade policies driven by corporate greed have uprooted communities, deepened inequality, and forced immigrants to live as second-class in societies that have failed to build just trade and immigration systems centered on human dignity.” Nicole Melaku, Executive Director, the National Partnership for New Americans

“Rather than protecting labor rights and the environment, NAFTA and the USMCA traded away the interests of workers in favor of the interests of big business, and freed multinational corporations from public regulation in the northern hemisphere and globally. Workers and unions have been denied legal status, forced to work longer for less pay, and threatened with outsourcing if they did organize for their rights. Global trade must have real benefits for workers and communities. Anything less is simply not sustainable.” Vicki Gass, Executive Director, Latin America Working Group

“At the U.S.-Mexico border, we witness every day how unjust economic systems and failed trade policies uproot families and force migration. Grounded in the call to uphold the dignity of every person, we believe trade and immigration policies must be rewritten to serve the common good. The USMCA review is a crucial opportunity to build an economy that keeps families together, protects communities, and helps address the root causes that compel people to leave their homes in search of survival.” Dylan Corbett, Executive Director, Hope Border Institute",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:05:37.966714

Plaintiffs filed suit alleging that defendant infringed their patent directed to fire wall hanger technology. Following discovery, the court partially granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, holding that defendant was estopped from asserting one of the three prior art references at issue in the proceedings, but that there were “questions of fact concerning whether [defendant] is estopped from asserting” the other two references. Defendant filed a motion to bifurcate the trial into two phases, proposing that the court conduct a bench trial on the estoppel issue, prior to a jury trial on the issues of infringement and invalidity. Plaintiffs opposed the motion. Following briefing, the court granted defendant’s motion, ordering that the trial should be bifurcated, with the issues on PGR estoppel to be decided by the court in a bench trial.

First, the Court noted that district courts routinely decide the application of PGR and IPR estoppel as a matter of law, and stated that “it is appropriate for the Court to resolve the factual disputes regarding PGR [e]stoppel in a bench trial prior to a jury trial on the legal issues.” The Court then turned to the question of whether bifurcation was appropriate here. To decide whether to bifurcate trial, courts consider several factors, including separability of the issues, simplification of discovery and conservation of resources, prejudice to the parties, and juror confusion. The court determined that bifurcation was warranted here. First, a bench trial on PGR estoppel in this case “would not violate the Seventh Amendment because . . . PGR Estoppel is not a common issue with either infringement or invalidity,” involving different witnesses, law, and facts. Second, bifurcation would promote efficiency and aid judicial economy because the Court was already “well-versed in the facts, expert opinions, and law . . . based on the PGR [e]stoppel briefing.” Additionally, a determination on the PGR [e]stoppel issue could also “obviate the need to adjudicate” aspects of defendant’s invalidity counterclaim. Third, any delay caused by bifurcation was small compared to the length of the litigation and was outweighed by the risk of prejudice to defendant from a single jury trial where defendant wasted time and resources arguing invalidity theories that were later mooted. Finally, bifurcation would reduce juror confusion because bifurcation would remove several witnesses and complicated testimony from the jurors’ consideration, allowing them to focus on the issues of infringement and invalidity.

Practice Tip: When involved in parallel proceedings before a district court and the PTAB, parties should consider whether any factual disputes related to PGR or IPR estoppel are better resolved by the court prior to a jury trial on infringement and/or validity. A court may favor bifurcation where it could simplify the trial, particularly where the court has already considered the issue in other briefing.

This was in honor of the Disappeared in America National Weekend of Action.

Over 60 demonstrators gathered together to pray for immigrants being deported or held in detention centers.

Ryan Brown is the wife of Ali who was deported in 2017. He was denied citizenship after their marriage in 2010 because of his asylum case back in 1999.

His case went back and forth in immigration court for decades. Brown said during his time in the U.S. he had legal work authorization, pay taxes, and had a legal drivers’ license.

“He has been gone for 8 years in September and we are working with the immigration law clinic to file waivers to allow his return to the United States. So we are just hoping to make progress on that soon,” she said.

Brown said she attended Sunday’s event to support other families affected by deportation.

She said she still has minimal contact with her husband. He is in a mining area that is not safe, little electricity and water. She said they will go weeks at a time without hearing from him.

“The system is broken. The legal system is broken. People are set up to fail the way things currently run. I am a pretty educated person myself. I have a Master’s degree and I have tried to navigate this system with him for 15 years,” she said.

She said nothing will change until there is an immigration reform to help secure the borders, and provide better assitance for immigrants trying to legally become citizens.

During the prayers, Brown became emotional as she held back tears, holding a sign of her husband.

Reverend Wesley Snedeker is the pastor of the Church of the Isles United Church of Christ of Indian Rock Beach.

“What we want to see is the violations of the human and civil rights of migrants stopped. We want to stop seeing people who are being detained without cause,” Snedeker said. “People who are many people who are trying to follow the process the right way, being detained in immigration courts or outside immigration courts.”

Snedeker also said he wants to ask the system to allow faith communities inside these detention centers to assist with the religious needs not provided for the immigrants.

How to listen to U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments in tariffs case A live audio feed of Supreme Court oral arguments is available online.","Oregon will go in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 5 to argue against some of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The lawsuit was originally filed by Oregon and 11 other states in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 23. It's since been consolidated with cases brought forth by businesses, all of which challenge the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to authorize the tariffs.

The trade court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have both ruled in Oregon's favor, saying the tariffs exceed Trump's authority.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court and requested an expedited timeline.

“This case is about the limits of presidential power,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement. “The Trump Administration’s attempt to use emergency powers as a back door to raise taxes on American families was never lawful.”

Oregon's Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman will speak for the states.

Oral arguments are scheduled to last 80 minutes.

If the court rules in Oregon's favor, the Trump administration could have to refund $90 billion in tariff revenue, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The tariffs have been a key piece of Trump's second term and removing them ""would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,"" the administration wrote in legal filings.

Trump considered attending the oral arguments and would have been the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He decided against it, writing in a social media post that he did ""not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.""

What is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act?

The crux of the case going before the Supreme Court is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

The 1977 law says the president can impose economic regulations in response to ""any unusual and extraordinary threat"" and has been used previously to put sanctions on other foreign powers.

The courts have so far ruled that IEEPA does not grant Trump the power to issue the tariffs.

Attorneys for the states and federal government will seek to convince the justices that their interpretation of the law is correct.

Oregon's lawsuit asked for the court to strike down the tariffs issued using IEEPA as justification.

Those include the ""trafficking"" tariffs placed on Mexico, China and Canada in February.

Trump declared an emergency and issued the tariffs ""to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.""

In April, Trump issued ""reciprocal"" tariffs on most countries, arguing that trade deficits constituted a national emergency under IEEPA.

Tariff lawsuit is one of many Oregon has filed against the Trump administration

Oregon has joined more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration since January, but this is the first to go before the country's highest court.

Oregon and Arizona are co-leading the tariff suit for the states. April estimates predicted the tariffs could cost U.S. households $3,800 annually and local businesses have said the increased costs have impacted profits and relationships.

As of August, the state had spent about 4,000 hours, or $1.15 million on those lawsuits and protected an estimated $4.4 billion, according to the Oregon Department of Justice.

The hiring-policy case is the second time in recent weeks that the California Supreme Court has refused to review a lower-court decision at the request of UC lawyers.
The lawsuit regarding UC’s hiring policy was filed by a former UCLA student and a lecturer in October 2024.
She is urging UC to take the Supreme Court’s decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

The recent refusal to hear UC’s challenge to the lower court’s decision was met with joy by immigrant rights groups. But UC expressed concern.

The university system has grappled with federal grant suspensions and other painful Trump administration actions after being accused of violating federal laws, and UC spokesperson Rachel Zaentz said in a statement that the ruling “creates serious legal risks for the University and all other state employers in California.”

UC is already fighting the Trump administration’s proposed $1.2-billion fine stemming in part from federal allegations that UCLA failed to protect Jewish students’ civil rights during pro-Palestinian campus protests last year.

The hiring-policy case is the second time in recent weeks that the California Supreme Court has refused to review a lower-court decision at the request of UC lawyers. Last month, the state’s high court declined to overturn an order that UC release the document outlining the terms of the Trump administration’s settlement proposal.

UCLA argued that disclosing the information would harm ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and open them up to unnecessary public scrutiny.

The lawsuit regarding UC’s hiring policy was filed by a former UCLA student and a lecturer in October 2024. It alleges that the UC system’s refusal to hire undocumented workers violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.

Plaintiffs argued that, without campus work, students lacking documentation not only miss out on career-advancing research opportunities but also often struggle to afford tuition, housing and even food.

In August, a California Court of Appeal ruled that UC had not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its “discriminatory policy.”

That ruling stopped short of overturning the hiring policy, but rather asked UC to reconsider it using proper legal criteria. Instead, UC opted to challenge the appellate court’s ruling to the state Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case last week, thus allowing the ruling to stand.

Former UC lecturer and plaintiff Iliana Perez said in a statement Monday that, as a formerly undocumented student, she had seen firsthand how employment restrictions limit opportunities for immigrant students. She is urging UC to take the Supreme Court’s decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

“The California Supreme Court’s decision not only reaffirms that discriminating against undocumented immigrants from accessing on-campus employment cannot continue to be tolerated,” Perez said, “but it also gives UC the clarity to finally unlock life-changing opportunities for the thousands of immigrant students who contribute to its campuses, and to the state’s economy and workforce.”

UC is “assessing its options” following the state Supreme Court’s decision, according to Zaentz. The university system did not indicate that it is plans to change its hiring policy.

“UC has been a leader in supporting its undocumented students — remarkable young people who have overcome obstacles and excelled academically — including hiring DACA students,” Zaentz said.

Under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children are protected from deportation and can get work permits.

UC does allow the hiring of students with DACA; however, new applicants have been shut out of the program for years. The Trump administration has proposed reopening DACA to first-time applicants, which would include many students who are now old enough to qualify, but has not done so yet.

Attorneys representing UC have argued that its hiring policy is justified because offering jobs to undocumented students could run afoul of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, a federal law that bars the hiring of people without legal status. Attorneys have said that hiring undocumented students could lead to litigation, civil fines, criminal penalties and the freezing of federal funding.

The three-judge appellate court panel, however, ruled in August that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds for UC to uphold the discriminatory hiring policy.

UC has historically advocated for undocumented students to receive equal treatment at its campuses. Several UCs provide spaces aimed at developing academic and leadership success among immigrant students, such as the Dream Resource Center at UCLA.

Issues regarding undocumented students have become more politically volatile during the Trump administration. At UC, concerns have grown not just around on-campus employment but also potential immigration law enforcement on campuses and in-state tuition rates.

UC, like other public state universities, offers in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who graduate from California high schools. Rough estimates say there are 80,000 students who benefit from Assembly Bill 540, which since 2001 has allowed such immigrants to avoid the much higher nonresident rates.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768062d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6218x3264+0+440/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F36%2F02d1acfc4401a8e3fa400c5273af%2F1297686-me-uc-board-of-regents-daca-students-jlc-0517-10768.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 07:02:04.239120

In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.
When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.
Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said.
But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protest was at Kent State University in 1970.","The Trump administration’s deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops to cities across the country, in the name of reducing crime, are having the opposite effect, according to local leaders — eroding the trust required for them to police effectively, making it harder for them to prosecute violent crimes, and leaving residents feeling less safe.

These concerns are noted repeatedly in interviews with policing experts and community members, and in lawsuits challenging troop deployments in several American cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Memphis, Tennessee.

In Chicago, ICE agents began using increasingly aggressive tactics in September during what President Donald Trump dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” It was a response, ICE said, to crimes committed by migrants in Illinois without documentation. The scenes have been dramatic by design: an overnight raid on an apartment building, with Blackhawk helicopters and U.S. citizens dragged into the street in zip-ties. The tactics have resulted in at least one death: In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González while attempting to pull him over and arrest him.

Locals in Chicago have turned out in force to protest, leading to daily demonstrations at an ICE processing center outside Chicago and elsewhere throughout the city. In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.

Nevertheless, the presence of immigration agents in the city — with their military-style uniforms and tactics — has made it harder, prosecutors argue in a federal lawsuit, to pursue cases against people accused of violent crimes in Chicago.

In one case, the wife of a man who had been murdered did not want to come to court to testify for fear of being arrested by Homeland Security agents. Her fear of arrest “makes it more likely that her husband’s murderers will go free and justice will be denied,” wrote Jose Villarreal, a prosecutor with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, in court documents.

Villarreal listed a wide array of crimes that his office can no longer prosecute because of ICE’s presence in the city: children who are victims of sexual assault, whose mothers fear that bringing them to court might lead to their arrest by immigration agents; domestic violence cases where victims fear testifying because of immigration agents stationed at the courthouse, meaning “the predators who victimized them may walk free.”

Amid the Trump administration’s insistence that its immigration enforcement is meant to ensure law and order, Villarreal argued that Homeland Security’s actions in and around courthouses in Chicago have made it harder “to protect the victims of violent crime and uphold the law through criminal prosecution.” A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office declined a request to interview Villarreal, citing the pending litigation.

Calls to 911 have dropped precipitously in the city since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Chicago Tribune reported, especially in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village. “They don’t really want to call the police because they associate the police with ICE,” Dolores Castañeda, a community activist, told the Tribune. As a result, residents “are feeling more unsafe than ever before.”

After the Trump administration began to flood Memphis with both National Guardsmen and other federal law enforcement agents in October, residents said that traffic stops by officers armed with assault rifles dressed in military garb made them feel less safe. “It makes everyone feel like a criminal. So you just literally criminalize the whole of Memphis,” said Keedran Franklin, a community organizer there.

In Memphis, where local police have struggled to build trust with communities of color — under the Biden administration, the Memphis Police Department was under investigation for using excessive force and racially profiling Black and brown residents — local police officers have been working side-by-side with the federal agents, doing traffic stops and executing warrants. In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.

“That's only made the relationship even more strained,” said Amber Sherman, a community activist and a member of a police reform task force in the city. “And I didn't think there was a chance of repair anyways, but I definitely don't think there is one now. Just because of the level of trauma that's being inflicted every single day.” The Memphis Police Department did not respond to a request to comment on Sherman’s concerns.

The playbook in Memphis was different from the other cities, because unlike governors in California and Illinois, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, supported the move. Several hundred federal law enforcement officers — from the National Guard and a wide range of other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — arrived to participate in an action the government called “Memphis Safe Task Force.” But the county’s Democratic mayor, Lee Harris, has since sued the governor and others. The enormous influx of troops led to over 1,000 arrests, and local jails do not have the capacity to hold that many people. Weeks after the task force began operating, Harris declared a state of emergency to deal with overcrowding in the jails. By the end of October, troops were still there and had made hundreds of additional arrests.

In Los Angeles, where the Trump administration began deploying troops in June, Trump said that the aim was to protect federal employees and property from protesters who objected to ICE’s aggressive tactics when they descended on the city in tactical gear, conducting large-scale workplace raids. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials sued the Trump administration, arguing that military presence would “only escalate tensions” and “erode public trust.”

Their warnings were prescient. When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.

“Soldiers patrolling the streets of Los Angeles have not made anyone safer; indeed, the opposite is true,” according to court filings in California’s lawsuit to end the National Guard deployment. The Trump administration’s “confrontational decision to deploy the military in a civilian city serves only to spread fear and heighten tensions in Los Angeles. If anything, the presence of the military threatens to further destabilize the community and escalate a situation that calls for cool heads and steady hands.” About 100 troops remain stationed there, according to military officials.

In interviews with The Marshall Project and in court documents, police experts argue that National Guard troops and other militarized federal law enforcement make it harder for police to keep cities safe. “For some chiefs, this is their worst nightmare,” said Christy Lopez, a Georgetown Law professor who oversaw Constitutional policing enforcement at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. “They've been working with communities for years — decades — building trust with immigrant communities, marginalized communities. All it takes is one raid to destroy years of goodwill,” she said.

That’s because modern-day policing depends on trust. To prevent and solve crimes, police need community members to call them in emergencies and to cooperate in investigations — actions the public won’t take if they don’t trust that their concerns will be taken seriously. “True public safety is only possible when the community believes that their police department exists to serve them with fairness, equity, and respect,” wrote U. Renee Hall, former Dallas police chief, in a declaration filed in the Washington, D.C., litigation, which began in early September, weeks after troops began patrolling the city with fatigues and armored vehicles.

Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said. “It’s all just people with guns who can tell you what to do.” Federal agents often wear tactical vests that say “POLICE” — although technically they are not — which further confuses people, said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer. “I don’t want the line blurred, because I don’t want ICE giving a bad name to police departments.”

Since the end of the Civil War, the idea that the military should not intervene in the country’s civil government — except in emergencies — has been enshrined in both law and our national values. A handful of such emergencies took place during the civil rights movement, when the federal government sent the National Guard to Southern states to assist with desegregating schools, at times over segregationist governors’ objections. The last time the National Guard was called into an American city was in 1992, when California’s governor requested assistance in Los Angeles amid riots after the acquittal of the White police officers caught on videotape beating Rodney King.

But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protest was at Kent State University in 1970. Amid escalating demonstrations against the Vietnam War, including a building on campus set ablaze, the mayor of Kent, Ohio, asked the state’s governor to send in troops. Shortly after arriving on campus, soldiers opened fire on a crowd, killing four college students.

In October, federal circuit court Judge Ronald M. Gould warned in a written dissent that “to have an armed military faced off against civilian protesters, whatever the motivation of the President, threatens to produce another tragedy, such as that occurring at Kent State University in 1970.” A majority of his colleagues on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Trump to continue with troop deployments in Los Angeles.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/PI7wTMeQ3lRp7cIwUyx4q0xCqCqN12BqLCY6vqCedus/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9mZ2xyeWtsbXBi/NW41ZmJiMnV2c2Zt/dnh6d3B4LzI1MTEw/NC1BTW9yYWxlc19G/RUQtUk9VTkRVUF9N/ZW1waGlzLmpwZw,N,,2025-11-04 06:18:18.095710

He had already levied tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico shortly after taking office in January. But are all these tariffs lawful? The Supreme Court will consider the question Wednesday.

The case concerns what the Trump administration regards as its greatest economic policy achievement to date, and what a bipartisan array of critics describes as a new effort by Mr. Trump to expand presidential power beyond the Constitution’s limits.

Why We Wrote This

After lower courts struck down the legal argument for the Trump administration’s most sweeping tariffs, the Supreme Court now takes up the matter. The case is important not only for the economic policy of the United States, but for the Constitution’s separation of powers.

Mr. Trump brought his case to the justices after three lower federal courts struck down the tariffs. The administration, the courts ruled, authorized the tariffs by misreading an emergency economic powers law. Decades of precedent support their interpretation of the law, the administration counters.

If the high court rules in President Trump’s favor, “it potentially offers unprecedented amounts of authority to the president,” says Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former acting deputy U.S. trade representative.

According to Mr. Trump, this power is critical to America’s economic competitiveness on the world stage.

The case is “one of the most important … in the history of our Country,” he wrote on social media last month. “If we don’t win,” he said at the White House in October, “we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said a ruling against the administration would raise difficult practical questions about what to do with the billions in tariff revenue already collected. Even critics of the tariffs agree with the Trump administration’s assessment – to an extent.

“I’m not sure it’s [one of] the most important cases in American history, but it is one for the ages,” said Michael McConnell, a Stanford Law School professor who is representing small businesses challenging the tariffs, during a call with reporters last week.

“This is a major confrontation between the executive branch and Congress,” he added.

Origins of tariff authority

The Constitution delegates the tariff power to Congress, with Article I stating that the legislative branch has the power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”

But Congress has also passed several laws giving the president some authority to set tariffs. The law at issue in this case is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This law – which doesn’t mention the word “tariff” – says that in the face of an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” the president can declare a national emergency and invoke the IEEPA, which provides them new powers to “regulate … importation.”

The Trump administration is arguing that trade deficits, as well as fentanyl trafficking from China through Mexico and Canada, are national emergencies justifying its tariff declarations. Mr. Trump is the first president to attempt to use the IEEPA to levy tariffs.

The closest another president has come to unilaterally imposing tariffs came in 1971, when Richard Nixon cited a predecessor statute to the IEEPA in ordering a small and “temporary” 10% tariff on imports to the U.S. He ended the tariffs four months later after successful trade negotiations with the affected nations.

The Trump administration says it is following a similar playbook, citing trade deals with the European Union, Japan, and Britain agreed upon after imposing tariffs. Unlike under President Nixon, however, many of those framework deals include a Trump tariff remaining in place.

Mr. Nixon “applied these tariffs for a short period of time,” says Ms. Cutler. “Under the Trump administration’s view, once you declare an emergency you can keep them for as long as you want.”

The Constitution and Congress’s role

The confrontation boils down to America’s earliest democratic principles. Taxation without representation sparked the Revolutionary War, and the Constitution sought to address it by giving Congress the exclusive power to levy taxes. By unilaterally imposing tariffs –effectively a tax on American businesses that import goods, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation) – critics say Mr. Trump is ignoring these foundational principles.

More specifically, the Trump administration has been doing an end-run around the Constitution by misinterpreting the IEEPA, critics from legal groups across the ideological spectrum claim.

The IEEPA, they argue, is effectively a wartime law. When the country faces an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” the act gives the president a range of new powers to address the emergency, including the power to “regulate … importation.”

That is not a power to set tariffs, critics argue. Furthermore, they claim, an emergency the Trump administration is citing is no emergency at all. The executive order imposing the “Liberation Day” tariffs, for example, includes the phrase “large and persistent…trade deficits.”

“Use of the IEEPA is limited to extraordinary emergencies, [and] a trade deficit is not unusual or even an emergency,” said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a legal group that represents a group of small businesses challenging the tariffs.

The center is one of a number of strange bedfellows fighting Mr. Trump’s tariffs. When it last appeared before the justices, the organization won a landmark case restricting union organizing rights around the country – a decision celebrated by conservative America. In the tariffs case, the organization now finds itself allied with left-leaning organizations including the Brennan Center for Justice and the Democracy Forward Foundation.

Also on their side is the Pacific Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that typically represents conservative causes. One of the group’s recent Supreme Court victories struck down a Biden administration loan-forgiveness program.

In the tariffs case “the issues are effectively the same,” says Oliver Dunford, a senior attorney at the firm.

“Here, the president is effectively making new policy,” he adds. “And if we want to address [a policy issue], Congress has to be involved.”

As for the bipartisan opposition, Mr. Dunford hopes it’s a “good omen that … in the future, there will be more bipartisan opposition to presidents when they exceed their authority.”

How the White House defends tariffs

The Trump administration, meanwhile, claims that the trade deficits have created “an ongoing economic emergency of historic proportions.” Using tariffs to pressure China, Mexico, and Canada to limit fentanyl trafficking into the U.S., meanwhile, is a valid use of the IEEPA, the administration argues.

One of the administration’s prominent claims is that the tariffs fall squarely within the presidents’ authority over foreign policy and national security matters.

The IEEPA “is a particularly broad delegation in the domains of foreign policy and national security,” the administration wrote in its petition to the court.

If the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, the administration added, it “would reflect an intolerable judicial intrusion into the President’s responsibility to manage foreign relations and trade.”

Trump administration officials have also raised what could be a persuasive “remedies” argument – one focused on what the administration would have to do should it lose.

In a declaration submitted to the court, Mr. Bessent wrote that billions of dollars in tariffs have already been collected. If the tariffs are suddenly eliminated, he added, “unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”

Given the time-sensitive nature of the case, most courtwatchers believe the justices will deliver an opinion months before the term ends in June.

Some experts also believe that a loss for the Trump administration wouldn’t mean the end of its tariff regime. The justices could uphold some tariffs but not others, and, if some tariffs are struck down, the administration could use other statutes to reimpose them. The administration has also set tariffs under different statutes, such as tariffs on steel and aluminum, that have not been legally challenged.

“If [the tariffs are] struck down, it would be a blow to the president’s trade agenda, but there may be a Plan B,” says Ms. Cutler. “We’ll still be in a world where tariffs are a core part of the administration’s trade agenda.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/11/1103_NTARIFFS_port_ledeL.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-11-04 12:06:17.392608

His family said to El País that he called them daily – until he seemingly disappeared without immediate explanation in June.
Gamboa’s family described not being able to find him until August, after they were scammed by two attorneys and then actually located him with the help of a third attorney.
An air ambulance paid for by ICE flew Gamboa to Costa Rica on 3 September, El País wrote.
But Gamboa’s family told El País that they are under the impression that the Costa Rican government is reluctant to get involved beyond “the bare minimum”.","The recent death of a Costa Rican man who was jailed by US immigration authorities in February before being deported in a vegetative state in September has prompted his family and supporters to speak out with allegations of negligence and inhumane treatment.

Nonetheless, a spokesperson for Donald Trump’s administration – which has aimed to deport as many people as possible from the US since his second presidency started in January – maintained in a statement that the medical treatment Randall Alberto Gamboa Esquivel received before his death is better than many immigrants “have received in their entire lives”.

The statement from assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that Gamboa “illegally reentered the US – a felony – in December 2024”. Citing information from Gamboa’s family, the Spanish-language news outlet El País reported that he had embarked for the US in search of work, and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested him in Texas in February.

Gamboa, 52, initially was held at Texas’s Webb county detention center before being transferred to another facility in the state in Port Isabel. His family said to El País that he called them daily – until he seemingly disappeared without immediate explanation in June.

Eventually, “someone at the detention center said he had a health issue, and that’s why he wasn’t answering us,” Gamboa’s sister, Greidy Mata, told El País. “But they didn’t give us any more information.”

McLaughlin’s statement said “medical professionals diagnosed [Gamboa] with unspecified psychosis and hospitalized him at Valley Baptist Hospital so he could get proper mental health and medical care”.

Gamboa’s family described not being able to find him until August, after they were scammed by two attorneys and then actually located him with the help of a third attorney. By then, Gamboa was bedridden in a vegetative state, and his family’s attorney began the process of having him sent to Costa Rica.

An air ambulance paid for by ICE flew Gamboa to Costa Rica on 3 September, El País wrote. Stricken with encephalopathy, the muscle ailment rhabdomyolysis and the inability to eat on his own, he was admitted to an emergency room in the Costa Rican capital of San José before being transferred to a hospital in his home town of Pérez Zeledón.

Gamboa then died in that hospital on 26 October.

His family has since sought to apply pressure on those in Costa Rica’s government to demand answers from their US counterparts. But Gamboa’s family told El País that they are under the impression that the Costa Rican government is reluctant to get involved beyond “the bare minimum”.

In a video recorded outside Gamboa’s funeral and aired by the Spanish-language news network Univision, his significant other Adriana Ureña said “the medical treatment that Randall got in the United States … in my opinion was terrible”.

One political figure in Costa Rica who has expressed support for Gamboa’s family is the nation’s former president, Óscar Arias, the winner of the 1987 Nobel peace prize.

“Randall Gamboa entered the [US] illegally but in perfect physical condition,” Arias wrote on the social media platform X. Condemning what he called the “complicit silence” of Costa Rica and the US, he added, “Randall’s family deserves to know the truth and to learn what happened when he was in custody of American immigration authorities.”

The Trump administration revoked Arias’s US visa in April, something the two-time Costa Rican president said was done because he oversaw his country’s formalization of relations with China in 2007. Arias, though, said he spoke out about Gamboa because he could not stay silent when “a Costa Rican – a humble Pérez Zeledón municipal worker – was deported in an inhumane condition”.

“I will not shut up when the lives of human beings are jeopardized,” Arias also wrote.

In her statement about Gamboa, McLaughlin contended, “Ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

The Trump administration initially insisted that its immigration crackdown would prioritize targeting violent criminals. But government data reported in September showed that immigrants with no criminal record were the largest group in ICE detention.

McLaughlin’s statement about Gamboa noted that illegally re-entering was a felony. The statement also made it a point to say Gamboa had previously been convicted of driving a commercial vehicle without a commercial license as well as fraud, neither of which is a violent offense.

Furthermore, Trump won his second presidency after separate New York state court juries convicted him of criminally falsifying business records as well as committing civil fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.

“Under President Trump and [homeland security secretary] Kristi Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences,” McLaughlin’s statement said. “Criminal illegal [immigrants] are not welcome in the US.”

Mata said outside Gamboa’s funeral, “The United States needs to realize Randall was not a delinquent – and he was wholly loved. … And he died surrounded by people who loved him.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64f3fc72c4bc20a782d16254b2cee910bddfea6/325_0_2921_2336/master/2921.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1313b6a8dcc586a776b4f95400f23f22",N,,2025-11-04 05:16:55.721263

“Operation Midway Blitz”

This all stems from “Operation Midway Blitz”, a massive ICE operation launched on September 8.

As DHS describes it, Midway Blitz is intended to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

“Governor Pritzker” refers to Illinois Gov. Jay Robert “J.B.” Pritzker (D), billionaire “heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune”, Democratic Party heavyweight, and a long-time and vehement critic of the president’s “mass deportation” plans.

And “sanctuary” in that sentence is a descriptive phrase, not a knock: Illinois and Chicago are each on DOJ’s “Sanctuary Jurisdictions” list, the former thanks to its “TRUST Act” (which the state argues “helps bolster community trust and cooperation”), and the latter its “Welcoming City Ordinance” (arguing that “Partnering with ICE would go against” its “mission to make Chicago the most immigrant friendly city in the country and turn” the city “into a community of fear for immigrants”).

Midway Blitz has resulted in 3,000 illegal alien arrests in Illinois and its environs (including 146 truckers at the Indiana State line), but it has also triggered any number of protests, some of which have turned violent – including one recently that resulted in a rear-end accident cum melee in suburban Evanston.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino

The “immigration chief” referred to in the judge’s order is Gregory Bovino (pictured above, speaking with DHS Secretary Noem), technically Border Patrol Chief in the agency’s El Centro (Calif.) sector but at present the “commander-at-large” in charge of Midway Blitz.

He’s been in the Border Patrol for almost three decades, and is unapologetic about his recent duties, telling CNN: “We’re going to carry out that mission . . . And that’s paramount, or else we shouldn’t be here. We’re going to carry that mission out.”

Pritzker is firing back, contending he “refuse[s] to let Trump, Noem and Bovino continue on this march toward autocracy. . .. Their plan all along has been to cause chaos, and then they can use that chaos to consolidate Trump’s power.”

Did I mention that an alleged Chicago-area Latin Kings member, Juan Espinoza Martinez, has been arrested and charged by DOJ with placing a $10,000 bounty on Bovino’s head?

The chief plainly elicits strong feelings. As Newsweek put it:

Bovino's approach to enforcement has been characterized by rapid, high-intensity operations, often referred to as ""turn-and-burn"" tactics. These methods have attracted criticism from local officials and civil rights groups, who argue that they disproportionately target immigrant communities and violate constitutional rights.

Chicago Headline Club v. Noem

Nowhere have those feelings run higher, though, than in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (greater Chicago), locus of Chicago Headline Club v. Noem.

The lead plaintiff in that case is “a non-profit membership organization of professional journalists working in the Chicagoland area with hundreds of professional journalist members”, and on October 6, it and others filed a complaint against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Bovino, and other officials over what they term to be:

the right of the demonstrator Plaintiffs to exercise their First Amendment rights to peacefully protest and to exercise their religion in the area around the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, and in other places where demonstrators are opposing the Administration’s federal incursion into the Chicagoland area.

They complain “Federal agents have responded” to those “peaceful protests” with “a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians”; on that basis, they sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to stop those alleged abuses.

In response, DOJ contended the plaintiffs are actually seeking “to dictate crowd-control policy in ways that would tie the hands of federal law enforcement officers (‘LEOs’) even in circumstances of imminent danger and would risk bogging this Court down in micro-management of crowd control decisions by federal LEOs”.

The case was assigned to district court Judge Sara Ellis, and apparently, she wasn’t bothered by “micro-management of crowd control decisions by federal LEOs”.

That’s because on October 28, she issued an order requiring federal agents in Midway Blitz “to place an identifier conspicuously on their uniform where one can easily view it and the Agent's equipment does not obscure it”, telling the government to “strive to ensure” agents carry body−worn cameras, and directing DHS to provide the court with “all CBP use of force reports relating to Operation Midway Blitz from” September 2 through October 25, and to continue to do so on an ongoing basis.

DOJ’s Petition for a Writ of Mandamus

Most crucially, however, Judge Ellis also ordered Bovino to appear in her court “in person, week days at 5:45 PM”. That prompted DOJ to file a petition for a writ of mandamus and a stay of that requirement, which the department termed an “extraordinary and extraordinarily disruptive requirement,” with the Seventh Circuit.

Among other things, DOJ argued:

The court’s order is . . . untethered to the plaintiffs’ underlying claims and goes substantially beyond what is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the court’s prior orders. And the order only underscores the extent to which the district court has exceeded its judicial role by arrogating to itself the role of supervising and micromanaging the day-to-day operations of an Executive Branch law-enforcement agency.

As the Legal Information Institute (LII) explains: “A (writ of) mandamus is an order from a court to an inferior government official ordering the government official to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion”. They are often sought in federal court when a party wants to appeal a decision but can’t.

TROs are short-term orders and not generally subject to appeal, but if Judge Ellis issues an injunction along the lines above, expect it to return more formally to the circuit court.

“Two Principal Failings”

In any event, on October 29, the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay of the order directing Bovino’s appearance pending briefing, and on October 31, issued its formal order in the case granting the petition for mandamus.

“While this litigation presents very challenging circumstances, the Seventh Circuit explained, “the district court’s order has two principal failings”:

First, it puts the court in the position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator of the parties’ adversarial presentations. Second, it sets the court up as a supervisor of Chief Bovino’s activities, intruding into personnel management decisions of the Executive Branch.

“These two problems”, the circuit panel held, “are related and lead us to conclude that the order infringes on the separation of powers.” Waiting for an appeal “would not solve the problems created in the interim”.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Bovino-Noem-Chicago.png,N,,2025-11-04 04:56:56.970177

According to the lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the plaintiffs fear that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, or anti-DEI policies, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers from loan forgiveness. They worry that a local nurse or first responder could be denied loan forgiveness because their local leaders defied the Trump administration.

The complaint argues the rule is ""an attempt to target organizations and jurisdictions whose missions and policies do not align with [the Trump administration's] political positions on immigration, race, gender, free speech, and public protest.""

""Politically motivated retaliation, like what the administration has done here, should have no place in America,"" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs.

The plaintiff group also includes the National Council of Nonprofits, which said in a statement upon the rule's release:

""Nonprofits operate food banks, serve veterans, assist domestic violence survivors, deliver meals to seniors, respond to disasters, and much more. Nonprofits must be able to identify and meet those needs without political interference, fear of retribution, or exclusion from a program designed to support their employees.""

Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent denounced the lawsuit.

""It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,"" Kent said in a statement to NPR. ""This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.""

In response to plaintiffs' concerns that the administration could use PSLF as a weapon to punish political opponents, Kent insisted ""the Department will enforce [the rule] neutrally, without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology, or the population they serve.""

The complaint says PSLF has allowed local governments to retain employees, including lawyers and engineers, who could earn more in the private sector. Albuquerque's leaders say that losing access to PSLF ""would likely create an untenable staffing crisis.""

In a statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu added: ""The City is joining with cities, unions, and nonprofits across the country to protect a program that helps Boston's workforce and millions of Americans in public service careers pay for college.""

What activities does the administration consider to be illegal?

One key question raised by this rule change, and the lawsuit, is: How will the Education Department define activities with ""substantial illegal purpose""?

According to the rule itself, such activities could include:

""aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws""

""supporting terrorism or engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy""

""engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of Federal or state law""

""engaging in the trafficking of children to another State for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents in violation of Federal or State law""

""engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination""

""and engaging in a pattern of violating State laws.""

If the secretary determines that an employer has behaved with ""substantial illegal purpose,"" according to the rule, the employer can either engage with the department and accept a corrective action plan or risk losing access to PSLF for its employees for 10 years.

In response to public comments, the Education Department has said, ""[it] would have no basis to remove eligibility from nonprofits engaged in work related to immigrant communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice if those organizations are following the law.""

But the plaintiff cities, which sit on the U.S. Justice Department's ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" list, say the Trump administration has already accused them of impeding the enforcement of federal law, and that this rule ""represents yet another attack on politically disfavored local governments and nonprofits that have local laws, policies, and missions that are anathemas to the Administration.""

""The actions of these cities are legal,"" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, another organization representing the plaintiffs. What's more, she says, ""whether or not these activities are legal, is not a [determination] that the secretary of education has either the right or the expertise to be making.""

The new rule is the culmination of a presidential action, issued in March, in which President Trump accused the Biden administration of abusing PSLF, and said the program ""has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.""

What did Congress intend when it created PSLF?

The plaintiffs argue Congress was clear about what should qualify as ""public service"" when it wrote the law, and that this new rule goes against lawmakers' intent.

""The Higher Education Act defines public service jobs as including government or a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization. It does not provide any discretion or wiggle room within that definition,"" Yu says. ""Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness. The secretary doesn't have the authority to change that.""

In response to public comments, the Education Department has disagreed, writing that ""[it] rejects the suggestion that this rule exceeds its legal authority. The [Higher Education Act] grants the Secretary explicit power to regulate title IV programs. PSLF is a title IV program, and its proper administration requires clear, enforceable standards.""

Another lawsuit was filed in tandem Monday, by a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, arguing on behalf of Democratic-leaning state governments that worry their public employees could likewise be denied loan forgiveness because of state leaders' decisions to support immigrants, promote DEI or provide gender affirming care.

The coalition of attorneys general warned in a press release that the rule would result in ""widespread confusion, fear, and instability in the public workforce, forcing states to confront severe staffing shortages, higher turnover, and skyrocketing costs to maintain essential services.""

According to federal data, more than 1.1 million public service workers have thus far had their federal student loan debts discharged under PSLF.

This story was updated to include comment from the U.S. Department of Education.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

More than a million Americans have had their student loan debts erased because they've worked in public service. Many teachers, nurses, government and nonprofit workers have stayed in their jobs in hopes of benefiting from the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Now, though, the Trump administration is changing the rules around who can qualify. Today, a host of cities and 21 states led by Democrats filed a pair of lawsuits saying they fear their public workers could soon be excluded. NPR's Cory Turner is here in the studio with more. Hey.

CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.

SUMMERS: So Cory, let's just start with a quick reminder of the PSLF program. How is it supposed to work?

TURNER: Yeah, it was created by Congress in 2007, signed by then-President George W. Bush. And the law offers what is essentially a quid pro quo to federal student loan borrowers. If you work for 10 years in public service, the government agrees to erase whatever is left of your student loan debts. The idea was to help nonprofits and state and local governments hire and retain good people even if they can't pay private sector wages. And Congress, we should say, defined public service really broadly in the law to include anyone working in government or a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

SUMMERS: Right, OK. So help me understand, then, how does the Trump administration hope to change this program?

TURNER: Yeah, they released a final rule change last week that will go into effect in July, and it allows the education secretary to deny loan forgiveness if employers engage in activities with, quote, ""substantial illegal purpose,"" Juana.

SUMMERS: OK.

TURNER: There, the department includes, quote, ""aiding and abetting violations of federal immigration laws,"" also engaging in, quote, ""the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of federal or state law."" The concern among these states and cities with this lawsuit is that by being what the Justice Department has called sanctuary jurisdictions, for example, or by following state or local laws that promote diversity or protect the rights of transgender people, the secretary of education could say to them, look, I think your leaders are acting with illegal purpose, and then bar any of that state or local government's employees from getting loan forgiveness. These suits accuse the administration, essentially, of trying to weaponize PSLF and they argue the secretary doesn't have the authority, let alone the expertise, to decide what is illegal purpose or to add restrictions that Congress never intended in the law.

SUMMERS: Cory, what's the Trump administration had to say about those accusations?

TURNER: Yeah, in a statement today from the undersecretary of education, Nicholas Kent, he called it - opposition to the rule unconscionable. Kent also said, quote, ""this is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm."" He also insisted the rule would be enforced, quote, ""without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology or the population they serve."" One last thing, Juana. Employers at risk of failing this new standard will have two options. They can risk being excluded from loan forgiveness for 10 years or they can change their policies as part of a corrective action plan.

SUMMERS: NPR education correspondent Cory Turner, thank you.

TURNER: You're welcome.

The case risks undermining Copenhagen’s strict immigration policy – which, according to newly appointed Immigration Minister Rasmus Stoklund, aims to “make it possible to send more people out of Europe.”

Stoklund will be questioned in parliament on Tuesday after Danish media reported in August a tenfold increase in international students from Nepal and Bangladesh from 190 students in 2019 to 2.146 last year.

Opposition parties, including the Liberal Alliance and far-right Danish People’s Party, have called for an inquiry, accusing the government of “losing control” of the country’s strict immigration policy.

“There is little to suggest that the government understands how serious this matter is,” Mikkel Bjørn, a far-right MP and vice-chairman of the immigration committee in the Danish parliament told Euractiv.

With national elections due next year, the backlash could not come at a worse time, as opponents sense political opportunity in questioning the ruling coalition’s credibility on one of its defining issues.

Frederiksen’s political headache

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s coalition – formed by her Social Democrats, the Liberals, and the centre-right Moderates – has built its reputation on one of Europe’s toughest immigration lines.

Her party’s goal is to prevent refugees from reaching Europe’s borders by establishing third-country facilities where both asylum processing and potential resettlement would take place.

The party has also claimed credit for inspiring a European Commission proposal that would permit the creation of deportation centres outside the EU.

However, the latest scandal has exposed an unexpected flaw in the country’s policy. Under current rules, foreign students from third countries who hold a visa are allowed to bring their families to Denmark – granting both the students and their relatives access to the labour market.

Right-wing parties now argue that the system is being abused, with applicants using the visas as a backdoor to work in Denmark. The number of accompanying family members has risen tenfold in recent years, according to data from Statistics Denmark obtained by the investigative outlet Frihedsbrevet.

Universities in the line of fire

The controversy first erupted two months ago, when Roskilde University – located 30 kilometres west of Copenhagen – was found to have a disproportionately high number of students from Bangladesh. Sixteen percent of the university’s new master’s students now come from the country.

Politicians from several parties, including government parties, accused universities of “running their own immigration policy” in contradiction with the government’s restrictive stance. The far-right party even demanded the resignation of Education Minister Christina Egelund.

Frederiksen herself publicly rebuked the university, saying universities should not “determine Danish immigration policy”. Following her comments, the chair of Roskilde University’s board, Carsten Toft Boesen stepped dow, even though the admissions in question were legal.

The university later acknowledged that its international admissions had “got out of hand” and stressed that Roskilde is “primarily for Danes.”

Closing the loophole

Since the scandal broke in August, the Danish government has moved to tighten oversight and close the loophole of international admissions.

New measures include higher Danish-language requirements for international students, stricter documentation of qualifications, and closer monitoring of recruitment practices. Further restrictions will take effect in 2026, including a ban on foreign students bringing spouses or partners to Denmark.

Still, opposition parties dismissed most of the initiatives as “quick fixes”.

“It’s great that measures are being taken,” said Danish People’s Party MP Mikkel Bjørn. “But I’m puzzled that the government does nothing to repair the damage that has already been done.”

He added that students who entered on “questionable qualifications” should be deported immediately. “If it were up to me, they’d already be on a plane back to Bangladesh.”

According to attorney Bjørn Dilou Jacobsen – an expert in immigration and human rights law – the issue is far from simple.

Each case would require an individual legal assessment to determine whether a student visa had been granted on false information. Even if that were the case, authorities would still need to assess whether deportation could raise human rights concerns under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – which protects the right to family life.

MP Sofie Lippert from the Green Left has also called the situation “an obvious problem”, adding that “student visas must not be used to exploit the system”.

The immigration ministry has not responded to Euractiv’s request for comment at the time of publication.

Louis on the Air” brings you the stories of St. Louis and the people who live, work and create in our region.","On Sept. 2, agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided a St. Peters restaurant and arrested more than a dozen workers. The Golden Apple Buffet’s employees hailed from several countries, including China, Mexico and Indonesia. Some have now spent weeks detained and awaiting deportation.

But the raid did not reveal evidence of human trafficking or any criminal enterprise, said Jim Hacking, an immigration lawyer representing 10 workers.

The raid didn’t target just the Golden Apple Buffet. ICE agents used battering rams to enter homes in St. Charles where about 20 of the restaurant’s employees lived.

“Two of my clients were getting out of the shower, and the person knocking on the door had a gun pointed at them,” Hacking said. “It was a very intense situation.”

Nearly one month later, nine of Hacking’s clients have agreed to a “voluntary departure.” The completion of that plan has been delayed by the ongoing criminal case against the buffet’s two owners, Guo Liang Ye and De Jin Ye, both residents of St. Charles County.

The federal indictment is light on detail. The owners are charged with a single felony of bringing in and harboring aliens. They are accused of acting with “knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that aliens had come to, entered and remained in the United States in violation of the law.” If convicted, the pair face a fine of up to $250,000 and 10 years in prison.

The press release from the U.S. Department of Justice made no mention of the workers or any illegal activities. Still, Hacking said he was compelled to investigate his clients’ living conditions. All of them had come to the U.S. from Indonesia.

Some had been in the country for a few months, others for years. “I was worried that these people were victims of human trafficking,” he said. But that’s not what he discovered. “Based on my conversations with everyone, I became convinced that they had found out about a job posting online, and they moved to St. Louis to take this job and to be able to live in that house.”

Although the indictment accuses the men of unlawfully remaining in the country, Hacking points out that they had all applied for visas. Eight had obtained work authorizations. All of them had made official pleas for asylum.

But those proceedings didn’t offer any protection on the day of the raid.

“People say all the time, ‘Why don't these immigrants just do things the right way?’” he noted. “Well, you know what my clients did? They went to the State Department, they paid a fee, they got a visa to the United States. When they got here, they applied for asylum, and after that, they applied for work authorization.

“And what did it get them? It got them dragged out of a shower at gunpoint, dragged into jail where they were sent to rot.”

Hacking contested some of the details alleged by neighbors, and published by Fox2, that described up to 20 people living in a single home in St. Charles. He said that the number was likely exaggerated and that the workers were spread over a total of four homes.

“I don't believe there were 20 people living in a house,” he said. “The reason I say that is because everyone that I talked to said they had their own room and their own bed.” Hacking acknowledged that the living conditions could constitute a housing violation.

“We can all agree that maybe you shouldn't have 12 people living in the house, and maybe there's housing codes in St. Peters that say you can't do that. Other than that, I think the government might have a hard time proving their case,” he said. “They thought they were going to find a place where everybody was undocumented and nobody had work authorization. I think they were surprised, at least with my clients, that the majority of them did have work authorizations.”

Hacking doesn’t represent all of the workers caught up in the raid. Although his clients were offered the choice of taking “voluntary deportations,” he said some of the workers are still being held in jail as potential witnesses.

Five of his clients have already left the country. He expects the other deportations will be carried out in the next couple of weeks.

Hacking sees the raid against the Golden Apple Buffett as part of the larger anti-immigration sweeps targeting individuals and businesses across the country. On Wednesday, ICE agents in Staunton, Illinois arrested a restaurant owner and detained him in the Ste. Genevieve jail, prompting hundreds to protest over the weekend.

“Making somebody stay in immigration detention is a very strong tool in their arsenal of getting people to leave the United States,” Hacking said. His clients spent weeks in the Ste. Genevieve jail, cut off from contact with their families and supporters.

These cases, he said, are spreading fear throughout the country.

“I can only imagine what people are going through,” he said. “Worried that they are going to get snapped up when they drop off their kids at school, or when they go to the doctor or they go to the gas station. It's just a really, really dark time.”

Multiple people from Honduras have been detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a shipyard in Harvey. Agents inspected the worksite, Barrois Welding Service, on Oct. 30, leading to the arrest of 25 workers. ICE said the operation stemmed from an investigation by HSI New Orleans in March after an employee was arrested for immigration violations. During the investigation, HSI agents served a notice of inspection and immigration subpoena on the owners of Barrois Welding Service. Barrios failed to provide the required employee documentation, including I-9s, identification documents, or a current employee listing. According to ICE, many of those arrested had criminal histories, including prior illegal entry, DUI, discharge of a firearm within city limits, and resisting an officer by giving false information. HSI New Orleans continues efforts to determine potential criminal culpability related to the investigation.

Last week, a federal judge ordered Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to appear in court every evening and turn over use-of-force files, although this has been paused pending appeal.","A security guard working at a superstore owned by an ally of Donald Trump was fired after filming a brutal Department of Homeland Security immigration raid in its parking lot.

Ricardo Mendez was positioned at the door of Menards—a Midwestern chain of home-improvement stores whose billionaire owner, John Menard Jr., is a GOP megadonor—in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, Illinois, when agents deployed by DHS arrived on Tuesday afternoon.

Like so many in the city since “Operation Midway Blitz” began in September, Mendez had been “on the lookout” since federal immigration officers “started taking over,” he told the Daily Beast.

When he saw the masked officers in unmarked vehicles drive into the lot, Mendez decided to pull out his cameraphone and start recording—“to do my part,” he said—as Illinois governor JB Pritzker has repeatedly asked people.

What came next was brutal, as the Puerto Rican security guard filmed two Border Patrol agents smashing the window of a white Ford pickup with their batons.

“The poor guy was surrounded by agents, workers, and customers,” said Mendez, 27, who added that the incident was so dramatic and shocking that other store staff also came out to film.

The officers then pulled out a Hispanic man before handcuffing him, and bundling him into an unmarked red vehicle.

After the man was detained, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in a separate unmarked blue Chevy Tahoe threatened to tear-gas anyone who intervened, Mendez says, before they all drove out of the lot as one ICE officer can be seen in his video flipping him the bird.

But despite Mendez having done what he believed any good citizen should have, he says a supervisor “sent me home” after Mendez objected to his superior’s demands to stop filming and go back to his position at the shop door.

Mendez, who claims that Menards’ bosses demanded store staff who had filmed the episode delete their footage, was then fired altogether the same day, according to a termination notice obtained by the Beast.

The letter from security contractor O’Brien & Associates—which provides security staff to Menards—cites “insubordination” and claims Mendez left his “designated post,” argued with an “ICE employee,” and “almost [got] pepper-sprayed.”

It states that he then returned to the lot twice against instructions, and when sent home, he told his site manager, “Make me.”

The letter says: “You are terminated as of Tuesday October 28th, 2025.”

Mendez disputes some of what his former company says, claiming managers had previously insisted the lot was private property and off-limits to immigration operations.

Having worked at the store for two years and now seeking a new job, he was unrepentant. “Would I do it again? Yes, I would,” Mendez said.

Menards is owned by John Menard Jr., a long-time Republican donor who has bankrolled conservative causes and worked with Donald Trump to advise on economic reopening in 2020, according to Urban Milwaukee and the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s summary of his giving to GOP-aligned groups. Federal contribution records show that Menards-linked donations flow overwhelmingly to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.

Since September, “Operation Midway Blitz” has seen the growth of hard-edged Border Patrol actions in and around Chicago, which have increasingly overshadowed ICE’s presence in the city, as the Trump administration escalates more widespread raids to increase deportation tallies.

Their actions have drawn blistering judicial scrutiny following tear-gas and pepper-ball deployments in residential areas and at a children’s Halloween parade. Agents allegedly broke a 67-year-old man’s ribs during the fracas.

Last week, a federal judge ordered Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to appear in court every evening and turn over use-of-force files, although this has been paused pending appeal. Barack Obama-appointed Sara Ellis also told Bovino he must wear a body camera.

The Daily Beast contacted Menards and O’Brien & Associates for comment twice on Thursday. Neither had responded by the time of publication.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the arrest had been part of a “targeted immigration enforcement operation,” which led to the arrest of Santos Mena-Flores, “a criminal illegal alien from Mexico with previous arrests for domestic battery, aggravated DUI, and violating a restraining order for assault.”

She said that Mena-Flores had “refused to comply with lawful commands to open his door during the operation, agitators started surrounding the vehicle, yelling profanities at agents and blowing whistles.

“Mena-Flores then started backing up his vehicles and officers fearing they would be run over, broke the vehicle’s window and placed him under arrest.”

McLaughlin added that Border Patrol “did not deploy any crowd control measures.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gV48gMEdAgfQ6x48q1OPOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/2a7bef3d4640b39b4bed1c2fbfed3770,N,,2025-11-04 01:56:39.676242

Tim MacDonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, is leading the legal challenge through court filings alongside immigration attorney Hans Meyer. They are arguing that ICE is conducting warrantless arrests that violate federal law. The lawsuit names four plaintiffs who were detained without warrants, including a Utah college student stopped after a traffic violation and a Colorado business owner who was mistakenly identified as someone else.

""It's really important that ICE complies with the law,"" MacDonald said. ""Our laws are harsh enough as they are.""

According to court documents, the plaintiffs include Refugio Ramirez Ovando, Caroline Dias Goncalves, and two others identified as J.S.T. and G.R.R. The lawsuit alleges ICE has a pattern of making warrantless arrests without determining whether individuals pose a flight risk, as required by federal statute.

MacDonald cited a case in Durango where ICE detained a father and two children despite searching for someone else, sharing that these types of situations occur often.

""ICE admitted in court that was a mistake,"" he said.

The family was transferred to a family holding detention facility in Texas.

""We are seeing these are not the exceptions,"" MacDonald said. ""This is what ICE is doing across the country while their rhetoric claims they are going after what they call criminals.""

The ACLU argues that federal law requires ICE agents to have probable cause that a person is both in the country unlawfully and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained.

""Before they seek to detain and arrest someone, they ought to make sure they have the right person and they do it lawfully,"" MacDonald said.

In response, ICE declined to comment on pending litigation. However, in court filings, the agency argues that ""Congress has authorized immigration officials to interrogate individuals and to conduct arrests with or without a warrant.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/3a14be32-1dc6-4153-ab12-1dd66d6d1735/20251104T014901/3a14be32-1dc6-4153-ab12-1dd66d6d1735_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 01:56:53.760923

The Episcopal bishop of Texas said the priest, who was a ""legally employed Kenyan clergy member who works for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,"" was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials this week while returning home from his workplace.

The statement added that the priest, who was not named, has been transferred to an immigration detention center in Conroe, north of Houston, and had been able to speak to his family. In its statement, the diocese, which covers most of the eastern part of the state, called for assistance from ""representatives in power"" and said pastoral and legal teams from the diocese are ""accompanying the priest's community and family as they continue to seek justice and understanding in this matter.""

Asked about the priest's arrest, the bishop, the Rt. Rev. C. Andrew Doyle, said the detained priest is ""OK"" but that church officials are still seeking answers. ""We do not know yet why he was targeted,"" Doyle told Religion News Service in an email. ""He is working legally and his immigration status is documented with a work permit.""

Doyle said that the diocese is also in contact with some elected officials in the region, although he did not name which.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At least one other religious leader, Muslim hospital chaplain Ayman Soliman, had been detained earlier by ICE as part of President Donald Trump's ongoing mass deportation effort. Soliman was detained in July and held for weeks before being released in September. A South Korean college student whose mother is an Episcopal priest was also detained over the summer, prompting outcry from faith leaders before her eventual release.

The administration's immigration policies have been widely criticized by religious leaders, including prominent Episcopal Church leaders. At a service at the Washington National Cathedral celebrating Inauguration Day, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, the Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, made headlines for her sermon, in which she asked Trump, who was in the pews, to ""have mercy"" on immigrants. The president later dismissed Budde as a ""so-called Bishop.""

A few weeks later, the Episcopal Church became a plaintiff in a faith-led lawsuit against the administration challenging the president's decision to rescind an internal government policy that discouraged ICE raids in ""sensitive locations"" such as churches. ICE and DHS agents have conducted enforcement activities near or even on church property at least 10 times this year.

In May, the Episcopal Church formally ended its longstanding partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees, citing the government's decision to halt the refugee program for virtually everyone except for white Afrikaners.

Religious leaders of various traditions have also protested the administration's immigration policies, with some being shot with pepper balls and pepper rounds and hundreds of others publicly pledging to put their ""bodies on the line"" to advocate for immigrants.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/webRNS-Episcopal-Diocese-Texas1.jpg?h=ada05aa9&itok=ZjAe_Psg,N,,2025-11-04 01:17:44.488327

Some restaurants are closing earlier than usual, street vendors are fewer and farther away, and more and more customers are using food delivery services instead of dining in.

On a recent Wednesday, only a handful of people were nervously standing at the bus stop on Hamlin Avenue across from Carnitas Uruapan. Inside the popular Mexican restaurant, tables sat empty during what would typically be a busy weekday lunch hour. Staff were screening customers at the door before letting them in.

It had been a chaotic morning marked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the city’s Southwest Side. Federal immigration agents, accompanied by Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, had swarmed one of Chicago’s oldest and largest immigrant communities — known as “Mexico of the Midwest” — and neighboring Cicero, arresting at least seven people, including U.S. citizens, and clashing with residents who filmed them. The security camera at Carnitas Uruapan had caught what appeared to be an ICE agent trying to enter — but the door was locked.

“We’re being selective about who we let in today, I guarantee most places out here right now have their doors locked,” Marcos Carbajal, owner of Carnitas Uruapan, told the Tribune on Oct. 22. “Lately, we have to keep an eye on the door just to make sure we’re only letting people in who look like they’re a regular diner.”

Intense immigration enforcement continues to ripple across the Chicago area as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz.” And the restaurant industry has been feeling the impact: Significantly fewer customers are dining in, owners are locking their doors when they feel unsafe and businesses are operating at a loss.

Since September, Little Village had largely avoided large-scale ICE raids. But on Oct. 22, the shrill sound of whistles filled the neighborhood as volunteers sprang into action, warning people to duck into stores or hide inside private properties.

“We are dying a slow death,” Carbajal said. As soon as the threat of the immigration enforcement “blitz” happened, weekday traffic dropped 50% at the Little Village restaurant, he said. And looking at an entire week, they are down 35%-40% compared with any given week before the operation started, Carbajal said.

Carnitas Uruapan opened its third location in Little Village at the end of January, shortly after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when fears about potential ICE raids were already circulating. Business started picking up in the summer, but it was short-lived.

“We’ve become unprofitable — we’re running at a loss,” he said. “I’m using my other two (locations) to keep people employed here and running at a loss so that I can try to get to the other side and just keep the doors open and keep people here. If I didn’t have three locations, this would have been over. I would just have to shut down.”

Carbajal employs 19 people across the locations and relies heavily on takeout from the Pilsen shop to stay afloat. The Gage Park location, tucked away on 55th Street and California Avenue, has seen a 15%-20% drop in revenue.

“If there are active raids in the area, you see a sharp impact in any of these places — if there’s anything going on that day, it almost lingers,” Carbajal said. “The rest of the day you’re going to have an empty dining room and the few days after will probably be slow too.”

On Sundays, Carnitas Uruapan has a security guard at the front entrance watch for suspicious activity that might require the restaurant to lock its doors, and to make sure customers are safe. On Saturdays, Carbajal and his father, Inocencio — also known to locals as “El Guero” — man the door.

The Tribune spoke to several restaurant owners about the impact of immigration enforcement on their businesses and on diners. The blow to foot traffic is widespread across the city, but was felt most in neighborhoods with higher Latino populations. The fear of run-ins with agents, or worse — detainment — has dampened an otherwise energetic shopping district in Little Village.

Little Village and Pilsen, much like Devon Avenue’s Little India in Rogers Park or Greektown on Chicago’s Near West Side, are microeconomies that rely heavily on a shared culture to keep things moving.

“A lot of people that work in these neighborhoods feel comfortable working in these neighborhoods because they speak the same language and share the same traditions,” Carbajal said, noting that his father came to Pilsen in the ’80s, settling in an area that reminded him of Mexico.

Chicago Ald. Mike Rodríguez, 22nd, who represents Little Village on the City Council, said the foundations that hold up the local economies will begin to crack when interconnected communities are attacked.

“The people who have worked in these neighborhoods their whole lives are just hurting,” Rodriguez told the Tribune.

Rodriguez said he didn’t see a single street vendor on 26th Street the Monday following the Oct. 22 raid in Little Village, an area typically humming with venderos selling produce or chicharrones. He said the raid was a turning point for the neighborhood. Locals are much more scared than they were before that day, Rodriguez said.

A certain part of the overall revenue funneled into Little Village has always been from individuals from neighboring states, Rodriguez noted. And it’s most often migrant tourists looking for specialty goods or dishes not found elsewhere.

“Those folks aren’t coming because they also don’t want to put their families at risk,” he said. “They may be going somewhere else, or just waiting for this to blow over.”

Rodriguez said some business owners he spoke to reported that weekly sales had already dropped around 70% even before the Trump administration took office in January. So it’s not all attributed to Trump or the increased immigration enforcement activity, Rodriguez noted, as some restaurants in Little Village have yet to fully bounce back to pre-pandemic levels of revenue.

At Rubi’s Tacos on 18th Street in neighboring Pilsen, business is steady, but the general fear of ICE is equally unsettling. Maria Landa, owner of Rubi’s, said she has to think about protecting both her customers and her staff.

“We tell our customers, you are safe here. You want to come, come here,” Landa said. “We’ll lock the doors if we ever need to.”

Landa, who moved to the U.S. in 1984 when she was 18 years old, focuses on the authentic flavors of Mexico’s Guerrero region at Rubi’s. The restaurant has been fortunate enough to serve a decent amount of diners, Landa said, but there are several longtime customers who haven’t been to the restaurant in over a month.

Community groups have recently begun organizing events that draw customers to local restaurants. Belmont Cragin United launched a mini “Taste of Belmont Cragin” event at the end of October. The restaurant crawl featured mom-and-pop shops like Latin Patio, Avenida Peru, El Taconazo Jr. and The Fancy Scoop, as well as street carts operated by the vendors’ children and grandchildren.

Ambrocio Gonzalez, chef and owner of La Catedral Cafe, which has locations in Little Village, North Lawndale, New Eastside and Brighton Park, said community events are the one silver lining: People are coming together and becoming even stronger.

Gonzalez, who employs a staff of 80, said he’s grateful for customers who purposefully come into his Mexican restaurants to support the culture.

“We’re trying to survive and at this point, we are living day by day,” he said. “Sales is a huge factor because if we don’t sell, we are not able to cover expenses or payroll. And on top of that, we don’t know what’s going to happen the next day.”

Gonzalez said his dining rooms barely fill up anymore, and it isn’t just the location in Little Village seeing less traffic.

“This is where we see that it’s not just about race, it’s about everyone being fearful because even if you’re out and you’re a citizen, (immigration agents) have been seen coming after people just for trying to help someone,” he said.

Gonzalez, like Carbajal at Carnitas Uruapan, also locks his doors as needed, but will soon go one step further.

“We’re trying to see if something can be done about the masks (that agents are wearing). So if you have those gator-type masks on, we’re not going to open the door,” Gonzalez said, noting that customers with medical masks and face coverings for religious reasons will be allowed in. “The amount of things that we have to be thinking and worrying about is just crazy.”

Gonzalez and several other restaurant owners compared the current climate to how small businesses fought to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic. But Esam Hani, a restaurateur who owns several restaurants along Milwaukee Avenue in Logan Square under the group One of a Kind Hospitality, said it’s significantly worse.

Hani, who is Palestinian, has had to make some difficult but necessary operational decisions to ensure his employees get their paychecks.

“I have to dip into my personal savings to keep the doors open, but for how long can I do that?” he said. “The landlords are not making concessions for us like they did in COVID. We’re still making the monthly rents, paying our employees, paying gas and electric … all that kind of stuff. Those costs are still there.”

A representative for One of a Kind Hospitality said the company employs over 100 people, of whom 80% identify as Latino.

“Three of my restaurants are Mexican restaurants I’ve had for 24 years now, so we built an old base of a Hispanic clientele that’s been with us and loyal to us and they’re not coming out anymore because of this,” Hani said.

Among the seven restaurants the group oversees is Cafe Con Leche, serving mostly Latin fusion food and coffee, as well the gastropub Harding Tavern and Saba Italian. Hani said the ICE-related lull, while affecting immigrant communities the most, is also prevalent in other demographics.

“At Saba, it was pizza Wednesday, and we have $10 pizzas that night as a special … I literally had three tables last week — it was horrible,” Hani explained. “Normally, we have a packed house. And I had a similar situation at one of my other restaurants where we didn’t even break $1,000 in sales.”

Hani is reporting a 35%-40% loss in sales with expenses “through the roof.” A drop in customers day to day, week after week, is not just abnormal for a restaurant, it’s also unsustainable, Hani added.

“And unfortunately, if this does go past the next couple of months, you’ll see a lot of small businesses start closing because they can’t pay their staff or they can’t pay their rent,” he said. “That’s just how it is in our industry.”

Those running restaurants stressed one thing over and over: Customers who are not afraid and are not being targeted should go out to eat now more than ever.

“We’re a whole ecosystem — we hire local people, we buy all our produce from local vendors, the people that are driving the delivery trucks that bring our meat, the people that are bringing our ingredients, these are all neighborhood people and the majority of them are Latino,” Carbajal said. “We all depend on each other.”

Carbajal said Carnitas Uruapan will happily drive beyond their normal delivery areas to field orders from office workers downtown, which could offset some of the impact of their empty dining room.

“I know it’s hard for people to go far outside of where they are or where they usually eat, but we need people who consider themselves allies to really make it a point to visit local restaurants,” he said. “Grab a drink with friends, join us for lunch, tip our staff well — we really are struggling for our livelihoods out here.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-ice-restaurants-02_245450020.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-03 23:17:11.509286

An immigration judge stayed his deportation on Thursday until the Bureau of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his case.
He has maintained his innocence in the murder case throughout his time in prison and his conviction was overturned this year.
His lawyers argue that the four decades he wrongly spent in prison, where he earned degrees and tutored fellow prisoners, should outweigh the drug case.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said on Monday that the reversal in the murder case does not cancel the drug conviction.","Two different courts have called on immigration officials to halt deportation of a Pennsylvania man who spent more than 40 years in prison for a murder conviction that was recently overturned.

Subramanyam Vedam, 64, was brought to the United States by his parents when he was nine months old. Vedam is a legal permanent resident, and according to his lawyer, had his citizenship application accepted prior to his arrest in 1982. He is known by his relatives as “Subu”, per the Associated Press.

He is currently being held in a short-term center in Alexandria, Louisiana, which is equipped with an airstrip for deportations.

An immigration judge stayed his deportation on Thursday until the Bureau of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his case. That could take several months. Vedam’s lawyers also got a stay the same day in US district court in Pennsylvania but said that case may be on hold given the immigration court ruling.

Vedam was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1983 and received an additional sentence of two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offense a year later, as part of a plea deal that was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence.

He has maintained his innocence in the murder case throughout his time in prison and his conviction was overturned this year. He was released from state prison on 3 October only to be taken straight into immigration custody.

The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking to deport Vedam over his no contest plea to charges of LSD delivery, filed when he was about 20. His lawyers argue that the four decades he wrongly spent in prison, where he earned degrees and tutored fellow prisoners, should outweigh the drug case.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said on Monday that the reversal in the murder case does not cancel the drug conviction.

“Having a single conviction vacated will not stop ICE’s enforcement of the federal immigration law,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, said in an email.

Vedam’s sister and lawyers argued that his stay in jail for over four decades negates the drug charge.

“We’re also hopeful that Board of Immigration Appeals will ultimately agree that Subu’s deportation would represent another untenable injustice,” Saraswathi Vedam said, “inflicted on a man who not only endured 43 years in a maximum-security prison for a crime he didn’t commit, but has also lived in the US since he was nine months old.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a407cbc15b94a40a300fe4bda076808981f83b5a/14_0_1761_1409/master/1761.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4b93ffef1886526034b58377a298039",N,,2025-11-03 20:57:17.615739

As the agents dressed in uniform walked on the property, numerous residents blew whistles and recorded video on their phones. The idea is to warn people that the agents are nearby and to document their actions.

""They see somebody outside and they just take 'em. No questions asked. It's just done,"" said activist Aileen Lopez.

A sign outside the complex warns unwelcome visitors to stay away. But the agents paid it no mind.

It is unclear who they were possibly looking for, but a few minutes after 10 a.m., they took a man into custody. Friends said he does not live there but was stopping by to give a coworker a ride to work.

One woman, who wants only her first name, Adriana, used, was recording from her balcony.

Nebraska will be paid about $2.5 million per month to house up to 300 immigration detainees under the contract, which is set to last through 2027.
Pillen had previously said he expected detainees at the facility Nov. 1, but he walked that back last week, saying there were a couple of issues that still need to be worked through.
“Phase one will be up to 200 detainees, and we'll start accepting detainees this week into the McCook facility,” Pillen said.
“ It'll probably take up to two to three weeks to get the first phase 200 and then the other phase has work to be done.","Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday that he expects people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to start arriving at a repurposed state prison in McCook sometime this week.

Pillen announced in August that the state would enter into an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to operate an immigration detention facility at the former site of the Work Ethic Camp, a minimum-security prison in McCook. The contract between DHS and the state was signed on Sept. 20 and released publicly last month. Nebraska will be paid about $2.5 million per month to house up to 300 immigration detainees under the contract, which is set to last through 2027. The state will also receive a $5.7 million reimbursement for modifications made to the Work Ethic Camp.

Pillen had previously said he expected detainees at the facility Nov. 1, but he walked that back last week, saying there were a couple of issues that still need to be worked through.

At a news conference Monday, the governor said there will be two phases to the plan to house inmates at the repurposed WEC.

“Phase one will be up to 200 detainees, and we'll start accepting detainees this week into the McCook facility,” Pillen said. “ It'll probably take up to two to three weeks to get the first phase 200 and then the other phase has work to be done. And don't have an exact timeline, but my guess would be that it would be by the end of the year.”

Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, “Dude, you can’t take my phone.” Ms. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent’s back to get his attention.","Brice Current, the police chief in the Durango, Colo., knew there was a problem the moment he saw the video of an immigration agent putting a protester into what the chief saw as a chokehold and throwing her down an embankment.

Immigration agents had arrested a Colombian man and his two children on their way to school last week, provoking a furious response from this liberal college town of 20,000 in the mountains of southwest Colorado. Dozens of residents — many with their arms linked — descended on the small Immigration and Customs Enforcement building where the family was being held, set up camp outside the razor-wire gates and tried to block authorities from removing the family from Durango.

What set the protest apart from similar clashes between residents and immigration agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities was Chief Current’s determination that the masked federal agent involved in the scuffle had crossed a line and his request for an investigation. He said he even considered filing criminal charges himself against the agent.

“It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” he said in an interview at police headquarters.

The scene from Durango, captured by fellow protesters and put on social media, was violent and jarring, but no more so than many others across the country. Several protesters, including elected officials and a Democratic congressional candidate, have been arrested or charged with federal crimes at immigration detention centers. American citizens have been whisked into unmarked vehicles and charged with resisting arrest or attacking officers, though the people arrested have maintained they did no such thing.

Protesters, journalists and clergy have sued over federal agents’ use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions against protesters. A U.S. citizen who was violently thrown to ground in Chicago has vowed to “pursue all legal avenues” against the agents involved.

But so far, no local prosecutors are known to have filed criminal charges against immigration agents.

In an interview, Chief Current said that rather than bring charges himself, he decided that state investigators were better equipped to handle thorny legal questions of whether the agent had broken any laws, or could even be prosecuted in Colorado.

Federal agents have broad legal protections, and the Trump administration has argued that the Constitution puts federal officers out of reach of state laws when they are carrying out their duties.

Still, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating any “state criminal law violations during the incident,” and would send its findings to local prosecutors to make a decision about whether to file any charges.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation declined to comment further. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sean Murray, the district attorney in Durango, said that before he made a decision about filing any charges, he would have to weigh whether laws were violated and whether the agent had immunity. If he did file a charge, he said he expected it would prompt reams of litigation.

Last month, when Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House Speaker, said local police could arrest federal agents who broke California law Ms. Pelosi’s assertion provoked a furious response from the Justice Department. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, called such an arresting “illegal and futile,” and fired off a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Ms. Pelosi warning them to “stand down or face prosecution.”

In Durango, Franci Stagi, 57, the protester who was involved in the altercation with the masked immigration agent, said she supported Colorado’s decision to investigate. The Times obtained videos which showed how the events unfolded from people on the ground, seen from multiple different angles.

Mr. Solano, his wife and their children landed in Durango about 18 months ago after fleeing political violence in Colombia, and applied for asylum, according to Enrique Orozco-Perez, a co-director of Compañeros, an immigrant resource center in Durango that worked with the family.

“They felt a sense of security because their case is active,” Mr. Orozco-Perez said.

Mr. Solano worked three jobs, and his wife did cleaning work, made empanadas and cared for the children in a rundown trailer park outside Durango. The family had no run-ins with local law enforcement, officials said.

Mr. Solano was driving Jana and Kewin to school that Monday when immigration agents stopped him at about 7:30 a.m. and pulled him from his car. He shouted to passers-by that his children were in the car.

His arrest turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, an ICE official in Denver later said during a court hearing reported earlier by The Denver Post. In Durango, Chief Current said he pressed ICE officials to at least release the two children from custody to reunite with their mother, but he was rebuffed.

Ms. Stagi said she does not attend many protests, but as a mother, she was outraged that two children could be arrested and held for more than 24 hours inside the ICE office that operates in a former carwash on the edge of Durango.

“They’re little kids,” she said.

Ms. Stagi’s confrontation with the immigration agent — who has not been identified by local law enforcement — occurred at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to videos from the protest.

The masked immigration agent was walking through a crowd of protesters when Ms. Stagi approached him, phone in hand, and asked, “You won’t even show your face?”

The agent hit her hand, knocking away the phone and possibly grabbed it. Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, “Dude, you can’t take my phone.”

Ms. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent’s back to get his attention. The instant she did, she said, he wheeled around, grabbed Ms. Stagi by the hair, put her into a chokehold, dragged her through the street and threw her down a grassy embankment.

Ms. Stagi said she realized in that moment she should not have touched the agent — an action that experts in police use of force said could be used to argue that the agent was acting reasonably.

“It was a knee-jerk reaction,” Ms. Stagi said. “I’m 5-2. I’m not assaulting him. I was just looking for my phone. He crossed the line.”

The protest again spiraled out of control later that day when more than a dozen federal officers — some in military-style gear — arrived to clear away protesters so agents could remove Mr. Solano and his children.

Videos show officers pulling the protesters away from the fence surrounding the ICE building and cutting through chains that protesters had put around the front gates. Officers pepper-sprayed protesters and fired crowd-control munitions at them. Some protesters appeared to push officers and throw water bottles.

Chief Current said the F.B.I. had opened an investigation into the clashes, raising the possibility that some demonstrators could face federal charges. An F.B.I. spokeswoman in Denver declined to comment, citing the government shutdown.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/04/multimedia/04nat-durango-ice-current-jvwq/04nat-durango-ice-current-jvwq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 19:02:11.994611

That theme continues even after she dismissed the case last year, because she hasn’t ruled on long-pending motions seeking the release of special counsel Jack Smith’s report on the matter, which she blocked in January.

On Monday, the federal appeals court that covers Florida issued an order putting Cannon on a two-month clock to rule. In a one-page order, a three-judge panel noted that the Trump-appointed trial judge has had release motions pending before her months, but that she “has not ruled or conducted any other further proceedings on the pending motions.”

The panel said that amounted to “undue delay” and gave the judge 60 more days to rule.

American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University have been pressing for release of Smith’s report.

Depending on what Cannon eventually decides, the issue could wind up back on appeal at the circuit court that had previously reversed her handling of the documents litigation before Trump was charged. After Cannon dismissed the case last year on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed, he appealed to the circuit court but, before the court ruled on Cannon’s dismissal, he withdrew the appeal after Trump won the 2024 election, citing the Justice Department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

,Policy,2025-11-03 22:30:43+00:00,NOTUS,Trump Administration Stops Publishing Immigration Data as It Ramps Up Deportations,"Jackie Llanos, www.notus.org, jackie-llanos",,,,,https://www.notus.org/immigration/trump-administration-immigration-data-deportations,"Agencies overseeing immigration have stopped publishing certain data, making it increasingly difficult to track effects of drastic policy changes in the second Trump administration.
However, the official didn’t answer questions about how the agency defined deportations to reach the overarching number.
Freedom of Information Act requests have become one of the only ways the public can obtain data about Trump’s escalation of deportations.
Even outside of the shutdown, obtaining data from a FOIA request can take years, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.
“Data transparency for us right now in immigration is like an oversight tool,” she said.","Agencies overseeing immigration have stopped publishing certain data, making it increasingly difficult to track effects of drastic policy changes in the second Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security announced last week what it called a record-breaking number of 527,000 deportations, with 364,800 coming from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 162,200 from Customs and Border Protection.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest and remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in our country,” a senior DHS official wrote in an email to NOTUS.

However, the official didn’t answer questions about how the agency defined deportations to reach the overarching number. DHS hasn’t published underlying data on removals and repatriations this year.

This is a switch from past administrations — including Trump’s first one.

“There’s no accountability, no way to assess, no public understanding about what’s really going on that is not curated by a press release from the agency, and that means that we just don’t know a lot about what is going on with most of the immigration system right now,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, describing the lack of data as crushing to DHS’ credibility.

ICE also hasn’t updated its removal operations statistics dashboard since January. That dashboard details arrests, detention and removals broken down by information including criminal history — a key indicator of how an administration is prioritizing enforcement.

The government does not track how many U.S. citizens it detains, according to a ProPublica investigation that prompted an ongoing probe by Democratic members of Congressional oversight committees.

Freedom of Information Act requests have become one of the only ways the public can obtain data about Trump’s escalation of deportations. However, getting a response to a FOIA request can be a lengthy and expensive process.

During the shutdown, getting information is even more difficult. NPR reported that it filed a FOIA request in August for waivers that exempt ICE agents from using federal license plates, but received an email in October saying requests were on pause during the shutdown.

The Deportation Data Project, created by a group of academics and attorneys who publish anonymized individual data on arrests and deportations, has stopped updating during the shutdown due to lack of information from the government.

Even outside of the shutdown, obtaining data from a FOIA request can take years, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.

“Really, FOIA is not an adequate substitute for transparency. It is very valuable, but it cannot substitute alone for the government proactively disclosing data to the public on a regular basis so that people can track the scale of government operations and help fact check claims made by the government,” Reichlin-Melnick said.

DHS and its subagencies are not the only ones with a data problem.

The Department of State hasn’t published its monthly reports on the number of visa issuances per country and category since May and refugee admissions since December. That missing data makes it more difficult for analysts to assess the changes in the legal pathways through which people can enter the country.

There’s no data available on visa issuances since before the government started social media screenings for international students during the summer, meaning that the scope of the changes is impossible to know.

Although aggregating data isn’t instantaneous, Cecilia Esterline, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, said the lapse in time without data was beyond what is normal.

“Data transparency for us right now in immigration is like an oversight tool,” she said.

Outside of permanent and temporary immigration processes, Esterline said the economic boost expected from the World Cup next year would be hard to predict without data on the number of tourist visas the government is issuing ahead of the tournament.

Over the last several months, Investigate Midwest has been reporting on how the Trump administration is reshaping the agriculture industry through the rollback of immigration programs and a mass deportation campaign.

Here are seven takeaways from that recent series:

Chicago-area raids have created fear among food warehouse workers

Undocumented immigrant workers in Chicago’s food warehouses face heightened fear of ICE raids and mass layoffs. This climate of anxiety has disrupted workplace routines and led to some workers leaving their jobs. The raids and policy rollbacks have also meant that the temp workers fueling much of this work have become even more vulnerable to exploitation, as they are now less likely to seek help.

The Trump administration is challenging state efforts to protect immigrant workers

Illinois lawmakers and worker centers have attempted to pass new laws and provide resources to protect immigrant workers, including education rights, driver’s licenses and legal support during ICE audits or raids. Despite these efforts, ongoing federal lawsuits and budget cuts at labor enforcement agencies have hindered progress, creating additional vulnerabilities within the workforce.

Policy reversals have created mass layoffs at meatpacking plants

Not only has the Trump administration deported thousands of undocumented residents, but it has also created more undocumented workers by rescinding various programs. This includes a humanitarian parole program, which allowed individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily to seek safety or escape political persecution. Many of those immigrants found work in meatpacking plants, but were recently fired, including at a JBS plant in Beardstown, Illinois.

Mass deportations are creating an agricultural labor shortage

Large-scale deportations and the rollback of programs allowing immigrants to work in U.S. agriculture legally have significantly reduced the available workforce for farmers and the broader food system. Efforts to fill these vacancies with U.S.-born workers have largely been unsuccessful, leaving vital sectors like farming and meatpacking facing acute labor shortages. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization.

Deportations are likely to expand the use of temporary foreign worker visas

The Trump administration’s aggressive deportation agenda is pushing the agriculture industry to rely more on temporary visa programs, such as H-2A and H-2B, rather than recruiting U.S.-born workers as Trump intended. Dairy, meatpacking and crop operations have increasingly turned to foreign labor to fill jobs vacated by deported or deterred undocumented workers.

Expansion of the H-2A visa program offers only short-term relief

In response to those labor shortages, the administration has modified the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for extended periods. However, this is widely considered a stopgap rather than a systemic fix — dairy and other year-round operations remain largely ineligible, and full-scale reforms have stalled without congressional action.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

Political and administrative inaction hinders long-term solutions

Despite acknowledgement from both government officials and industry leaders that labor shortages threaten farm viability and the nation’s food supply, there has been little legislative movement. A federal government shutdown and a lack of hearings in Congress have delayed substantial immigration and labor reforms, leaving small farms especially vulnerable while favoring larger, industrial producers that are better equipped to navigate visa complexities and automation.

For the second time in a little over a week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedly shot someone in Los Angeles, California. This time, it was a US citizen who ICE officers shot from behind while he was driving a car, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times.

The victim was a 25-year-old named Carlos Jimenez, who is a father of three. He was shot after getting out of his car to tell ICE agents, who had pulled over a vehicle, that children would soon be gathering in that spot for the school bus, his lawyer, Cynthia Santiago, told the newspaper. The agents’ cars had blocked a southern lane on the road and jutted into a second lane, according to the LA Times. “He was telling them, ‘Excuse me. Can you guys please, you know, please wrap this up.’ And immediately, the masked agent pulls out a gun and exchanges some words,” Santiago told the newspaper.

The lawyers allege that Jimenez then got in his car, reversed because he was afraid, and was shot in the back of his right shoulder, where a bullet remains lodged. “Use of deadly force is to be used as a last resort,” Santiago said. “Coming out to communities with guns drawn is the opposite.”

ICE, for its part, has offered a more sinister characterization of the events. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told the LA Times that Jimenez “attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping” and that the shots were “defensive.” Jimenez was charged in federal court with assault on an officer and released on bond Friday.

In the ICE agent’s criminal complaint, filed in federal court on Friday, he claims Jimenez “engaged in a verbal altercation with the officers” and that the complaining officer then told Jimenez to leave and grabbed his pepper spray. As this unfolded, the complaint claims, Jimenez pulled his car forward and to the left, and then apparently turned and “rapidly accelerated in reverse.” One of the officers at the scene apparently “feared that the [Jimenez’s car] would hit [the officer]” and the car they had previously pulled over.

There does not yet appear to be any publicly available video of the incident. Jimenez’s condition was not immediately clear.

There have been other recent reports of immigration officers shootings. Between August and October, ICE officers reportedly shot into four cars—one in LA less than two weeks ago; two in Chicago, including one that was fatal; and one in San Bernardino.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, told the LA Times that the latest incident is “another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day in and day out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals.”

But what it more likely indicates is even more proof that, as my colleague Noah Lanard wrote last week, ICE seems to pose a far greater danger to civilians than the other way around—contrary to the agency’s claims that they require the National Guard’s protection.

As he wrote:

A Mother Jones review shows that there is little evidence that ICE agents face such severe and widespread danger compared with other law enforcement agencies that they need military personnel to come to their aid or to break from centuries of public accountability by hiding behind masks.

The Trump administration has provided almost no information to back up its statements about rising assaults, which makes its claims hard to assess. But details about ICE officers who’ve died on the job are readily available on the agency’s website.

Those records show that none of ICE’s agents have ever been killed by an immigrant in the agency’s more than two-decade history. Instead, the leading cause of death by far among ICE officers is COVID-19. According to ICE’s data, the second leading cause of death is cancer linked to 9/11. (The pandemic and cancers connected to the September 11 terrorist attacks account for 75 percent of the deaths in ICE’s history.)",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_11_03_ice-e1762204511785.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-03 17:17:13.722415

Massachusetts, New York and 20 other states, also filed a separate lawsuit Monday, making similar arguments. Both lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

Plaintiffs in both suits allege the administration is trying to use the loan forgiveness program as a political weapon.

“Contrary to law, the regulation allows current and future administrations to change PSLF eligibility according to their priorities or ideology, inviting government overreach and abuse and creating instability that will undermine the program’s success.

In September, the Commission asked a local judge to allow its suit against Corrections Department Secretary Alisha Tafoya Lucero for allegedly violating a new state law —the Nondisclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Act — that prohibits state employees from sharing personal information, including immigration status, to anyone outside of their agency except in limited circumstances.

New Mexico probation officers accused of referring ‘problem’ probationers to ICE for deportation

The Commission received a complaint, which it then investigated, that alleged state probation officers referred information about at least three probationers’ immigration status to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency after July 1, when the law went into effect.

At the time of the lawsuit, ICE held two of the probationers in ICE custody, and deported one to his unspecified home country, causing “hardships to their New Mexican and American family members,” according to the lawsuit. The other two probationers’ status remained unclear as of Monday.

The Ethics Commission alleges probation officers lured the probationers to meetings “under false pretenses” at their local probation offices, where ICE agents were waiting to detain them.

While the NSPIA empowers the Commission to sue alleged violators, the agency asked a First Judicial District judge in Santa Fe to weigh in on whether a pair of federal laws conflicts with the new state law.

Those 1996 federal statutes say local and state governments can’t “be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service,” which became ICE in 2003.

In response to the Ethics Commission’s request in state court, the Corrections Department on Oct. 17 filed a motion in federal court that argued a federal judge is best suited to weigh in on the Commission’s request, given that the Commission’s motion seeks interpretation of federal law.

In that filing, the department did not address the underlying allegations about its probation officers’ collusion with ICE.

But the Ethics Commission pushed back against the suit’s removal to federal court in its Oct. 31 motion, saying that federal courts have routinely ruled they don’t have jurisdiction to take over requests like the one the Commission made in state court.

According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.
Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge.
In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport people who illegally crossed the Texas-Mexico border.
Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest immigrants.","On the evening of July 1, Luis Medrano called Houston police for help after his wife had gotten violent and punched him twice in the face during a schizophrenic episode in which she was hearing tormenting voices, according to a police report.

Medrano, 50, a Mexican immigrant who met his wife when they crossed the Rio Grande with a group of about a dozen other migrants more than three decades ago, had tried to take his 47-year-old wife to the hospital, but she refused to go. So he did what he’d done three times before: called the police so they would take her to a hospital.

But this time, the officer arrested her on suspicion of assault and booked her into jail. And after a prosecutor dismissed the case, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, picked her up from jail and eventually deported her to Mexico.

“My children blame me for all of this,” Medrano said. “But believe me, this was not my intention; I only wanted to get her help.”

In Texas, which has the second-largest population of immigrants living illegally in the country — with more than 1.6 million of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — the local criminal justice system has become the main funnel sending immigrants into ICE custody, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of federal government data.

Medrano’s story is emblematic of how the Trump administration has intensified its immigration enforcement compared to Trump’s first term, which focused largely on the southern border amid a record number of asylum seekers. The administration’s focus has now shifted to Democratic-led states such as California, Illinois and New York, where witnesses have recorded masked ICE agents using force in some cases to arrest people at worksites, immigration courts, commercial parking lots and at their homes.

From Trump’s inauguration to July 29, ICE made 138,068 arrests nationwide, 24% of them in Texas.

The Tribune analyzed ICE’s enforcement data from September 2023 to late July 2025, comparing the last 18 months of the Biden administration with the first six months of the Trump administration’s second term. The data, obtained through a public records request to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by the Deportation Data Project, a group of immigration lawyers and professors, shows that in Texas:

ICE’s average daily arrests have more than doubled from 85 under Biden to 176 under Trump.

Daily arrests have jumped about 30 percentage points in the ICE regions that include Houston and Dallas.

About 52% of ICE arrests have been of people in local jails, down from 61% during the Biden administration.

Arrests of people who had not been convicted of a crime have increased from 42% under Biden to 59% under Trump.

The Harris County Jail leads the country in ICE detainers — a request from immigration agents to hold a person for deportation — while jails in Dallas, Bexar and Travis counties have also been in the top 10.

The data is the most detailed information to be made publicly available since Trump’s return to the White House and offers a glimpse into its aggressive immigration enforcement in the nation’s interior.

Legal observers have noted the administration has stopped consistently publishing detailed immigration data that his predecessors routinely shared with the public — in some cases, previously published data has been deleted from government websites. For example, a Department of Justice report that showed immigrants in Texas commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens disappeared from the DOJ website soon after Trump took office.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to questions from the Tribune by citing an Oct. 30 social media post by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin that said “70% of illegal aliens ICE has arrested have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.

“And that doesn’t even account for those wanted for violent crimes in their country of origin or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists,” the post says. “The list goes on. The media continues to act as a PR firm for criminals.”

Paul Pirela, a Houston-based immigration lawyer, said the data reveals that the Trump administration’s strategy is simple: “Deport as many people as possible and as fast as possible.”

Cesar Espinosa, executive director of the immigration activist group FIEL in Houston, said his organization can gauge how quickly the Trump administration is working compared to the Biden administration by the number of phone calls they get.

During the Biden administration, he said, “We might get one or two calls with somebody getting picked up by ICE every month, every other month. Now we’re averaging about 15 to 20 calls a day.”

That’s because Texas has been among the most receptive states to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, said Rocio Paez Ritter, a sociology and criminology associate professor at the University of Arkansas.

“What is happening in Texas is that there seems to be a system in place that makes it easier to help ICE deport people, compared to other states like California, where there is more resistance,” she said.

Less than half of arrested immigrants had criminal convictions

In its first term, the Trump administration focused on the southern border as hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many from Central and South America, came seeking asylum. The administration implemented policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “remain in Mexico” policy, under which more than 70,000 non-Mexican people were forced to wait in Mexico until their asylum cases wound through U.S. immigration courts.

But the second Trump administration has been even more aggressive in clamping down on immigrants living illegally in the nation’s interior, setting a goal for ICE of at least 3,000 arrests a day. The data shows that in the first six months of this term, ICE averaged 727 arrests a day, more than doubling the 304 daily arrests under Biden.

To help meet that goal, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration enforcement in July aimed at expanding immigrant detention centers and hiring as many as 10,000 additional ICE agents by the end of the year — which would more than double its current staffing of 6,500 agents — and enticing recruits with a $50,000 signing bonus.

“So as those new officers come on, that is inevitably going to lead to a major increase in arrests, and as detention centers come online, more people will be detained, and so immigration enforcement is going to get more aggressive over the next two years,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, a group in Washington that advocates for immigrants. “I don’t see this as just an initial surge followed by a slowdown. I think the goal of this administration is pedal to the metal at all points.”

During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump promised “the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,” and administration officials have repeatedly said they are going after “the worst of the worst.”

But during its first six months, the data show that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who don’t have a criminal record than the Biden administration did in its final 18 months. In Texas, 58% of people ICE arrested under Biden had criminal convictions, compared to 42% under Trump, according to the data, which doesn’t specify the type or seriousness of those crimes.

The rhetoric that the Trump administration is going after hardened criminals gives the impression that the administration is focused on the general public safety, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology at the University of California, Irvine.

“Are like 95% of these people arrested the worst of the worst? I don’t think so,” she said. “So the net keeps widening for who is being caught up in these practices and policies.”

César Cuauhtémoc García-Hernández, an immigration law professor at Ohio State University, said the deportation quotas the administration set for itself are pushing them to look beyond people convicted of crimes.

“There simply are not enough migrants in the United States who have committed serious crimes to reach the kinds of detention and deportation numbers that the president and high-ranking and immigration officials in his administration have committed to,” he said.

Two Texas arrests: One on the street, one at an ICE check-in

The data shows that even though the Trump administration has mostly depended on local jails to find and arrest immigrants living in the country illegally, ICE agents have also conducted more non-custodial arrests on the streets, in homes and during ICE check-ins. Some immigrants who have been allowed into the country are required to report to ICE offices periodically while their immigration cases — such as asylum requests — are pending.

Under the Biden administration, 80% of ICE arrests came from county jails and federal and state prisons. Under Trump, that number has dropped to 64.1% — which underscores the increasing ICE activity outside of the criminal justice system.

One of the people arrested recently was Marwan Marouf, who was on his way to work after dropping off his 15-year-old son at a Dallas high school in September. According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.

Marouf, a Palestinian born in Kuwait with Jordanian citizenship, came to the U.S. on a student visa to study electrical engineering at Louisiana State University, then landed a job as an electrical engineer in Dallas. That’s where he met his wife, a fellow Jordanian who was visiting her sister. A year later, they married and had their first child, Mohammed Marouf, now 27.

The elder Marouf became active in the local Muslim community, volunteering to mentor young people and deliver sermons at a local mosque. He also volunteered with other religious groups, including local Christian and Jewish leaders, his son said.

As part of his volunteer work, he donated to a Palestinian-led charity called the Holy Land Foundation, which the Bush administration shut down in 2001 and later prosecuted its leaders, accusing them of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, which the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization.

Marwan Marouf, like many others, said he donated to the charity believing the group’s efforts were solely to support Palestinian people affected by the Israel-Palestine war.

So when he applied for his green card in 2014, immigration officials notified him that they planned on denying his application. Five years later, their U.S.-born son sponsored his parents for a green card — his mother’s application was approved in 2020.

But on Sept. 22, when ICE agents arrested Marwan Marouf, they gave him a letter notifying him that his green card application was denied. Since then, he’s been in custody at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, about a three-hour drive from Dallas. His lawyers are attempting to fight his deportation.

“We’re very spiritual, so we know God has a greater plan for us,” Mohammed Marouf said.

Marwan Marouf has never been charged in connection with his donation to the now-defunct charity. But a statement attributed to McLaughlin, from Homeland Security, said: “A green card is a privilege, not a right. If you are pushing Hamas propaganda, supporting terrorist organizations, and conducting other anti-American actions, you will face consequences.”

A month before Marouf’s arrest, ICE agents detained Austin resident Yony Perez-Oduardo, 42, but they didn’t have to go looking for him.

Perez-Oduardo had entered the country in Brownsville in May 2022 and when Border Patrol arrested him, he was placed in the Migrant Protection Protocols and was allowed to remain in the country while his asylum request was pending, as long as he checked in with ICE in San Antonio.

Meanwhile, his 40-year-old wife, Ana and their 14-year-old daughter — who came to Texas through a Biden administration program that allowed Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to enter the U.S. under a parole program that Trump has since shut down — eventually received green cards, making them legal permanent residents.

Meanwhile, Perez-Oduardo continued to do his semiannual check-ins with ICE, waiting for a decision on his asylum case. On Aug. 12, Perez was arrested at an ICE office in San Antonio as his wife and daughter watched.

“They took him away and our girl had to witness it,” said his wife. “It traumatized her.”

ICE deported Perez-Oduardo to Mexico in the past month, his lawyer said, because it’s a faster process than trying to deport him to Cuba. If he fought his deportation, he could have been kept in detention for months and banned from the country for a decade, said his lawyer, John Tutton. Perez-Oduardo may have a chance to eventually return to the U.S. because his wife has sponsored him for a green card, his lawyer added.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago

After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge. When he tried to post bail for her release, Harris County Jail officials told him ICE had placed a detainer on Gonzalez so agents could deport her after her case was settled.

When prosecutors dismissed the case, she was immediately transferred to an immigrant detention center, then deported to Mexico on Oct. 1. Medrano, who was also living in the U.S. illegally, followed her, leaving their four U.S.-citizen adult children behind. They have since relocated to San Luis Potosí, where they have some distant relatives.

In 2017, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office agreed with ICE to let its agents have access to the jail to investigate inmates’ immigration status.

“This agreement has allowed our agency to redeploy deputies who previously were performing ICE duties in the jail to local law enforcement duties that enhance public safety,” said Jason Spencer, a Harris County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson.

Unlike California, which has the most immigrants living illegally in the country, Texas has followed the Trump administration’s lead in cracking down on them under Gov. Greg Abbott.

Since 2021, the state Legislature has approved more than $11 billion for border enforcement and building border walls — all part of Abbott’s signature Operation Lone Star, which since 2021 has sent thousands of state troopers and National Guard soldiers to the Texas-Mexico border.

In 2017, the Legislature approved a bill that outlawed any local policies that prevent cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement, a law that has forced immigrant-friendly cities and counties to work with ICE, even if local leaders oppose it.

In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport people who illegally crossed the Texas-Mexico border. The Biden administration, El Paso County and immigrant rights organizations sued the state to overturn the law, which is on hold while the case remains pending in the courts.

And in this year’s legislative session, lawmakers approved a law requiring Texas sheriffs to enter into formal agreements with ICE that allow them to deputize some deputies to work as immigration agents. Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest immigrants. Between late January and early September, troopers arrested 3,131 people across the state, most of them on suspicion of improper entry into the country.

In Harris County, which leads the country in ICE detainers, Abbott recently launched a violent crimes task force that includes state troopers and local police, and said residents should expect a higher law enforcement presence “swarming” the area.

“The Trump administration is relying quite heavily on partnerships with local law enforcement agencies in Republican-led states, because those are the places that are willing to work hand in hand with ICE,” said García-Hernández, the Ohio State professor.

Those partnerships can help turn a misdemeanor arrest into a deportation.

Once a person is in jail for any offense, ICE agents can check their immigration status, and if they’re in the country illegally, ask sheriffs — who commonly run the jails — to hold the person for them so they can be transferred to ICE custody and deported.

“Sometimes it’s been as simple as a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt or a DUI or other charges,” said Pirela, the Houston immigration lawyer.

Medrano said he and his wife, who have lived most of their adult lives in the U.S., will struggle to establish new lives in Mexico.

“Before all this, we had a comfortable life,” said Medrano, who worked as a construction contractor most of the time that they lived in Houston.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ICE_AP_25262430533418_NAT_0920,N,,2025-11-03 16:57:10.095633

Guerra Leon was released on October 31 after a federal judge from the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on October 30 calling for his immediate release. Defying the order, ICE officials refused to release Guerra Leon when his attorneys arrived at the detention facility that same day – forcing his legal team to file an emergency motion.

Within minutes of receiving the TRO, Guerra Leon’s attorneys drove more than five hours to Jackson Correctional Facility in northern Louisiana to bring Guerra Leon home. When they arrived, facility staff refused to release him despite being shown the federal order. ICE officials claimed to have “no knowledge” of the ruling and took no action to comply. Instead, the facility called the local sheriff on the attorneys.

“Carlos is an 18-year-old who wanted to go home to his mom,” said Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project. “There was no basis for him to be detained in the first place. Even with a team of attorneys and a federal court order requiring his immediate release, Carlos was forced to spend another night in jail. This is just another example of how immigration enforcement that targets everyone without regard to legal limits and failure to immediately act on court orders is harming our community members in irreparable ways.”

Ordering the government to respect Guerra Leon’s valid immigration protections – deferred action status and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) – Judge Terry Doughty wrote that Guerra Leon’s release, “…serves the public interest by ensuring that the Government adheres to its own laws and by preventing the public interest from being undermined through unnecessary detention.”

“The fact that Carlos sat unlawfully locked up for yet another night–beyond the already nearly three months of unlawful detention–packed into a room with over 100 grown men is abhorrent,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director for the ACLU of Louisiana.“One would have hoped that an administration so focused on law and order would uphold that very same law and order when it came knocking. That it was not upheld, calls into question the administration’s respect for the very foundation of our democracy and our three co-equal branches of government.”

“As a young person with special humanitarian protections, Carlos should’ve never been detained in the first place,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at RFK Human Rights. “But like so many others, he was snatched from his community and disappeared to Louisiana – a move we’ve seen time and time again as the government continues to weaponize immigration detention. We applaud the court for upholding Carlos’ fundamental rights and we applaud Carlos, who demonstrated amazing resilience and heart in an unimaginable situation. We remain committed to fighting for the many others like him who have been wrongfully subjected to this administration’s cruelty.”

Guerra Leon is a recent high school graduate from Spring Valley, New York. He came to the United States from Guatemala when he was ten and was later granted deferred action status and SIJS, a humanitarian immigration program designed to protect children who have survived parental abuse, abandonment, and neglect. His status allowed him to attend school, work legally, and build a stable life in the U.S. But on August 9, Guerra Leon was stopped by federal officers and arrested without a warrant. He was sent to Jackson Parish Correctional Center, a Louisiana ICE facility a thousand miles from his home.

Guerra Leon has now been released and reunited with his family in New York.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, has hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.

Here’s what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.

What are the charges?

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

What is the motion to dismiss about?

Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive” and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn’t matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.

“The relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,” McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are “plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.”

What is the main motion to suppress evidence about?

Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.

In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.

Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had “no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.”

Is he being deported?

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",https://wpcdn.us-midwest-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.fox21online.com/content/uploads/2020/05/fox-21-avatar.png,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:31.814146

Trump’s enforcement efforts have unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.

Here’s what to know about the latest legal efforts on the issue:

Tennessee court addresses Guard deployment in Memphis

Monday’s hearing on the Memphis deployment is before Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal in Nashville.

Democratic state and county officials contend in a lawsuit that Republican Gov. Bill Lee cannot deploy the Tennessee National Guard for civil unrest unless there is rebellion or invasion, and even then, it would require action by state lawmakers.

In a legal filing last week, the state said the plaintiffs are misinterpreting how the Tennessee Constitution classifies the National Guard. Tennessee law gives the governor “the authority to dispatch the Guard when needed and to determine when that need exists,” the state added.

Since their arrival on Oct. 10, National Guard troops have been patrolling neighborhoods and commercial areas of Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid in downtown, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police.” Officials have said Guard members, who are armed, have no arrest power.

Trump announced in September that the National Guard would accompany authorities from a slew of federal agencies as part of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force.

Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who is not involved in the lawsuit, said he never requested that the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump made the announcement and Lee agreed, Young and others have said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders.

Since they arrived Sept. 29, the federal agencies have made more than 1,500 arrests and issued thousands of traffic citations, according to statistics provided by the U.S. Marshals Service. Arrests have been made on charges ranging from homicides and drug and weapons violations to immigration warrants. Lee has said the National Guard would “play a critical support role” for local law enforcement.

Young said earlier this month that operations include some 150 Guard members.

The Memphis Safe Task Force includes 31 partner agencies across different levels of government and more than 1,700 personnel, according to a court declaration by Chad Hunt, chief inspector with the United States Marshals Service and the task force’s commander.

Judge considers West Virginia deployment in D.C.

West Virginia is among several states that sent National Guard members to Washington, D.C., to support Trump’s crime-fighting efforts. Last month, a West Virginia judge asked attorneys for the state to address whether Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s deployment of up to 300 Guard members to the nation’s capital in August was legal.

A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says in a lawsuit that Morrisey exceeded his authority. Under state law, the group argues, the governor may deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state’s emergency request.

Morrisey’s office has argued the deployment was authorized under federal law.

After one witness for the plaintiff group testified Monday, the judge said the hearing would continue on Nov. 10.

Kanawha County Circuit Judge Richard Lindsay in Charleston heard initial arguments in the case Oct. 24. The civic group argued it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from government accountability and transparency.

The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision. Lindsay rescheduled the hearing and ordered the state to focus on whether what Morrisey did was lawful.

The West Virginia National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November.

While Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, the U.S. Justice Department says violent crime there is at a 30-year low.

Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them.

Separately, a federal judge heard arguments Oct. 24 on District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb ’s request for an order that would remove National Guard members from Washington streets. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not rule from the bench.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-10-17T014416Z_908606297_RC29DHARRXYM_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MEMPHIS-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:37.846082

Wyden and 10 other senators raised concerns with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) “near-total secrecy” as part of its mass deportation agenda. IAO has been centrally involved in immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump administration.

The senators pointed to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers. Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” the senators underscored in their letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Reports of a recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several deportees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them their destination. In addition, deportees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. Lastly, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” the senators concluded.

The senators pressed Noem and Lyons to answer questions that would provide Congress and the American people much-needed transparency, including the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

The administration announced last week a rule that would curtail the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and restrict the types of workers and fields eligible for the benefit. The program has historically allowed government and nonprofit workers to apply to have their remaining federal student loans canceled after 10 years of service and monthly loan payments.

A coalition of nonprofits and city and county governments, including a variety of teachers unions and legal aid and immigration rights groups, filed suit in Massachusetts seeking to block the rule. A second lawsuit, also filed in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by 21 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia.

The Trump administration said the rule finalized last week would exclude employers that “engage in unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose, including supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration.”

Critics warned that the rule could give the administration the power to exclude nonprofits and government agencies that back policies at odds with the administration’s agenda. Groups that aid undocumented immigrants or support diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children could potentially be at risk.

The city of Chicago — a frequent target of President Trump — said it feared it would be penalized because of its inclusion on a Justice Department list of so-called sanctuary cities that the department claimed impeded enforcement of federal immigration laws. Albuquerque, Boston and San Francisco, which also appear on that list, are also plaintiffs in the suit filed by cities and nonprofits.

The states’ lawsuit said the new rule would “empower the Department of Education to serve as a roving enforcer of the administration’s animus” by stripping the loan forgiveness eligibility from workers whose employers are disliked by the administration.

Both lawsuits claim that the new rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeds the Education Department’s authority.

“It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,” Nicholas Kent, the under secretary of education, said Monday in response to the lawsuits. “This is a common-sense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/03/multimedia/03trump-news-pslf-topart-tbcj/03trump-news-pslf-topart-tbcj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 14:01:11.549450

Johnson opened by describing higher education as a place “to dive in murky waters, and not necessarily to find a way out.” That set the tone for an exchange that moved between biography and theology. He asked Yanklowitz what had first drawn him toward the rabbinate. Yanklowitz traced it to his interfaith upbringing with “one parent evangelical Christian and the other a Reform Jew,” and to his embrace of Judaism as a “religion of protest.”

“It’s not a religion of submission. It's primarily a subversive force of protest.”

He went on to outline a spiritual journey from his interfaith youth in Chicago through years exploring Reform Judaism, “black hat” Orthodoxy, and even a West Bank settlement, searching for a “sweet spot between particularism and universalism.”

Johnson found parallels in his own path from a conservative African American Baptist church to more activist congregations. Both men noted that early religious formation had demanded certainty, only for adulthood to demand nuance. For Yanklowitz, Orthodoxy’s “black-and-white” appeal eventually gave way to what he called “progressive Orthodoxy—an oxymoron,” one that insists on moral complexity while holding fast to tradition. “I’m trying to figure out a way to live in the complexity and the paradoxes and the messiness of the fullness of life, and yet also not lose those basic simple truths,” said Yanklowitz.

Dialogue Across Difference

When Johnson turned to the question of religion’s place in a polarized democracy, he wondered how to teach students who know only “constant chaos” and view consensus as weakness. Yanklowitz replied that hope depends on proximity:

“When we’re distant, just on social media, it’s very hard to hold on. The more proximate we get, the more hopeful I can be.”

He argued for a pluralism that resists both relativism and authoritarian unity, invoking the Tower of Babel story as a defense of “the dignity of difference.”

Johnson answered from a political historian’s lens. African American faith, he said, had long oscillated between realism and hope: “We wanted to believe in something that hadn’t materialized.” Students, he added, hunger for honesty about “the racial roots” of current crises and for courage to speak publicly about them.

God, Justice, and the Work of Humility

The dialogue then turned inward to the question of God in social change. “I cannot imagine a more robust philosophy of caring about human rights than the notion that there is godliness in every person,” Yanklowitz said. Yet he cautioned that “the scariest people I know are positive they’re on the side of good.” Faith, he argued, must cultivate humility, not certainty: “A racist is a rejecter of God. If you look at a skin color and don’t see God in that person, you’ve denied God.”

Johnson, invoking theologian Anthony B. Pinn, wondered aloud whether God-language still holds meaning for a people “constantly acting and hitting our heads against the wall.” For him, belief remains both necessary and challenging: “Politically, I know we have to act in the world. Yet we were definitely abandoned.” The two found common cause in that tension, seeing religion’s power less in dogma than in its capacity to bind wounded communities.

When audience members asked about the temptation to misuse religion in politics, Yanklowitz conceded the danger. “It’s easy in the sanctuary to hold ideals,” he said, “but once you become a practitioner, you have to sacrifice.” On immigration, he described his own activism grounded in Jewish scripture’s repeated command to “love the stranger,” while acknowledging the practical “messiness” of borders and property.

Learning to Hope Again

The evening closed on the question of pessimism. Johnson called Afro-pessimism a discipline of truth-telling, “a way to check our bad faith.” Yanklowitz agreed that utopias were illusions but urged faith in process: “Justice, justice you shall pursue—the first justice is the ends, the second is the means.” He concluded with a story about an asylum-seeking mother and her young child who had stayed in his home for Shabbat after their journey through the desert. Unable to communicate with her because of the language barrier, he watched as his own toddler began to play with hers, and their laughter filled the room.

“If we can learn to play together again in a society where we’re just yelling at each other, if we can learn to form these new groups across these lines and laugh together,” he said, “pessimism becomes impossible.”

In a season defined by division, the conversation offered no neat resolution, only what Johnson had promised at the start: a willingness to “sit in the murky water” together and keep faith that dialogue itself is a moral act.",https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/Johnson-Yanlowitz%20Faith%20Event%20%282%29.png,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:35.146533

At the time, Manzo was taken aback by how fast the immigration officer apprehended the man on 63rd Street.

Huerta Cisneros was “minding his own business — not creating havoc.","CHICAGO LAWN — Fresh bread in hand from Carniceria La Hacienda, Edgar Manzo was returning to his car when a red minivan pulled up quickly.

The situation caught Manzo by surprise. The red Chrysler Pacifica came close to the front of his car on West 63rd Street, and he briefly “thought someone was pulling up” on him the morning of Oct. 15.

As he got into his own car, Manzo saw an apparent officer in “full uniform,” but no badge, exit the minivan, pull up his mask and approach a man walking toward the same grocery store Manzo had just left.

Manzo pulled out his phone and started recording, he said.

Manzo’s quick decision would end up providing a Chicago Lawn family with the only concrete evidence they could find that their missing loved one — who has schizophrenia — had been taken by federal agents.

At the time, Manzo was taken aback by how fast the immigration officer apprehended the man on 63rd Street.

“Maybe two seconds — two or three seconds — that’s all it took for him to take out the zip ties, tie him up, and then he walked him to” the car, Manzo said. Another officer joined them.

“I was trembling myself,” Manzo said. “I’m recording and I’m not sure if these guys are going to throw their car at me next or come to my window next for some reason.”

The apprehended man was “so calm, he didn’t fight back,” Manzo said, adding that he couldn’t make out anything agents might have said to the man.

Then the agents took the man away. Manzo didn’t know who he was, but posted the video on Facebook.

It soon circulated among community groups, and made its way to a pastor who recognized the man as Omar Huerta Cisneros, a permanent U.S. resident who has had a green card allowing him to live and work in this country since 1988, according to his family. The pastor, Rose Garcia, contacted his family.

Without the video, barely longer than 30 seconds, Huerta Cisneros’ family says they wouldn’t have known what happened to him. And, because he has schizophrenia, he “doesn’t have the mental capacity to reach out to anybody,” Araceli Favela, his sister-in-law, previously told Block Club.

“He doesn’t know anybody’s phone number,” she said. “He does not even have a cellphone himself.”

The family scrambled to find him.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement wouldn’t help them, even after the family reached out to members of Congress and the Mexican consulate. Family members searched for Huerta Cisneros for two weeks before Favela received tips about someone matching his description near a Walgreens in Franklin Park. She rushed to the area and found him Tuesday morning.

Family members believe immigration agents dropped him off there — possibly a day after detaining him. But federals officials never contacted the family with details, and they don’t know where he slept during his time away from home.

“He said something about ‘They said it was too far’ to take him home,” Favela said.

Spokespeople for immigration agencies didn’t respond to requests for comment on the detainment.

Manzo said “with everything going on in the neighborhood” it was his “instinct” to record because “what if something bad happened?” Filming Huerta Cisneros’ detainment was the first time he’d documented an immigration arrest, Manzo said.

He was “emotional” afterward, calling his wife and his parents to “let it out.”

“I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this poor guy. This is crazy the way they’re doing these things,'” Manzo said. Huerta Cisneros was “minding his own business — not creating havoc. He’s just a guy … a dark-complected guy.”

Manzo doesn’t know Huerta Cisneros but has learned about him through community posts and realized he went to school with his niece. The family thanked him via Facebook for taking the video, he said.

The speed with which the car pulled up and how quickly Huerta Cisneros was detained has stayed in Manzo’s mind, leaving him mulling the question, “What if it was your family?”

“It’s just the fact that he was an older gentleman, walking down [the street], doing nothing,” Manzo said. “It’s like ‘wow.'”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Cisneros.png,N,,2025-11-03 14:56:38.422497

A recent Stateline article highlighted concerns among public-health experts that racial health disparities in the United States may widen as the federal government has begun dismantling programs designed to address inequities. Many grants and offices aimed at supporting health outcomes for communities of color, low-income populations, and rural areas have been terminated or scaled back.

The reductions include thousands of research grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related agencies, and the discontinuation of funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which had been used to mitigate historic gaps in care, environmental burdens and chronic-disease burden among racial and ethnic minorities.

With program capacity shrinking and federal backing waning, state, local, and nonprofit organizations are struggling to fill the vacuum and it’s doubtful they can match the scale of lost support. Experts believe this could mean slower progress or even regression in closing health-outcome gaps across race and place. From the article:

“You’ve got declining capacity, and increasing need — which is a formula for problems,” said Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy. “It’s impossible to make all that up with state and local dollars,” he continued.

This issue of federal policy impacts on minority communities will also be the subject of a 2025 MACo Winter Conference panel titled, “Federal Policy and Marginalized Communities: County Strategies for Support and Equity.” This session will take place Thursday, December 11, 2025; 1:30 PM – 2:30 PM and feature speakers discussing impacts including civil rights protections, immigration enforcement, LGBTQIA+ communities, and more.

WASHINGTON, DC — UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, released today findings from its Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, the biggest bipartisan poll of Latinos. The survey of 3,000 registered Latino voters finds that 81% are concerned Congress is not fulfilling its checks-and-balances role and is ceding too much of its constitutional authority to President Donald Trump and the executive branch. This electorate is the nation’s second-largest voting-age population and a critical group whose priorities carry significant weight, particularly in an environment of razor-thin margins.

Nearly two-thirds (62%) disapprove of how the Republican Party is leading Congress, and a similar share (61%) hold Republicans responsible for the recent federal government shutdown, compared to just 22% who blame Democrats. If the 2026 midterm elections were held today, with 75% saying they are certain or likely to vote, 52% of Latino voters would vote for the Democratic House candidate, 28% for the Republican. This signals both parties have work to do to win over more of these voters.

Regarding President Trump, 64% disapprove of his job performance. Of those who voted for him, 13% say they would not vote for him again and another 9% are uncertain they would choose him. The issues most shaping views of President Trump include the cost of living and inflation, immigration arrests and deportations, jobs and the economy and cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.

“Like a majority of American citizens, Hispanic voters are blaming the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans for not focusing enough on the economy, especially the rising costs of food, housing and health care. We are now in the longest government shutdown in history, and families are dealing with disruptions to critical services and skyrocketing insurance costs,” said UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía. “Equally alarming is that Hispanic voters feel that civil rights, freedoms and their personal safety, and that of their loved ones, are at risk. They are deeply concerned Congress is not exercising its duty to provide a check-and-balance on the administration.”

Pocketbook issues continue to dominate Latino voters’ priorities — reflecting heightened concern over the cost of living, jobs, housing and health care affordability, with immigration rounding out the top five. In addition to economic insecurity, Hispanic voters are also feeling their freedoms are under threat. The poll found that:

72% oppose the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use appearance, languages, and work/labor as grounds to arrest someone on suspicion of immigration violations.

59% believe civil rights and liberties have become less secure.

A majority do not support the way in which federal military/national guard deployments are occurring, including 31% who believe such deployments should not happen at all.

49% are very concerned that they or someone close to them may become a victim of political violence, with 44% believing that recent increase in political violence is mostly due to Republican talk, as opposed to 19% holding Democrats responsible.

41% think people fear immigration authorities will arrest them even if they’re U.S. citizens or have legal status.

“For Latino families in rural America, the economic challenges emphasized by this poll hit even harder, from rising housing and health-care costs to wages that fall short. Nearly half of rural Latino families say they’re struggling just to meet basic expenses,” said Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas, based in Glenwood Springs, CO. “The future of rural America is deeply connected to the Latino experience, and if our elected officials want to understand where the country is headed, they need to start listening to the Latino communities that feed it, build it and keep it running — and begin working to address our needs.”

Other key findings nationwide include:

On Issues and Economic Landscape

Four of the top five priorities for Hispanic voters continue to be driven by pocketbook issues:

#1 Cost of living/inflation (53%) — Cost of food and basic living expenses, housing affordability, gas prices and electricity bills.

#2 Jobs and economy (36%) — Wages, job security, prices and job creation.

#3 Housing (32%) — Rising cost of rent and cost of electricity, utilities, taxes, home insurance, home maintenance/repairs and lack of affordable housing.

#4 Health care (30%) — Rising health care costs, monthly premiums, co-pays and deductibles.

#5 Immigration (20%) — Path to citizenship for law-abiding, long-residing undocumented individuals; safe and humane facilities for those in detention; giving people their day in court.

Compared to last year, 39% feel their economic situation is worse now; only 14% say they are doing better. Looking ahead to next year, 50% believe the Trump administration’s economic policies will make them worse off.

65% believe President Trump and Congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on improving the economy, a 5% increase since April 2025.

On the Political Landscape and Environment

Views on parties: 55% say the Democratic Party cares a great deal about the Latino community while 29% say the same of the Republican Party. In contrast, 33% say the Republican Party is hostile towards the Latino community, compared with 7% of respondents saying the Democratic Party is.

Which party is better on specific issues: Hispanic voters say they trust Democrats more to handle health care (55%), climate change, voting rights, and immigration reform (each at 51%) and inflation and affordability (50%). Conversely, they believe Republicans would do a better job managing border security (37%).

Military deployments: 33% believe federal military deployments should only happen if state or local leaders request them. 31% say federal military deployments should not happen at all and only 24% say the federal government should be able to send military forces even if local governments do not want them.

On Immigration

On recent immigration policies and actions, 33% said employers have lost workers because people fear being arrested if they go to work, and 29% say children are missing classes because their parents fear being arrested while taking their kids to school.

Top immigration policy priorities include a path to citizenship for law-abiding and long-residing undocumented individuals, including those who were brought to the country as children (43%); ensuring detention facilities are safe, sanitary and humane once immigrants are detained (35%); ensuring people in deportation proceedings have a chance to make their case in court (34%); and cracking down on human smugglers and drug traffickers (33%).

In addition to the press briefing noting national results, UnidosUS will host a series of virtual press briefings to share findings at the state level:
