Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29 and originally from El Salvador, has been charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Tennessee with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

He was released from federal detention on Friday after being held since March, when he was arrested and then deported back to his home country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

In a new filing to the Tennessee court on Saturday, Mr Garcia's defence lawyers said that immigration officials threatened the 29-year-old with deportation to Uganda earlier in the week.

According to the filing, while he was held in Putnam County Jail on Thursday, Mr Garcia declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and remaining in prison.

After he left jail on Friday, ICE notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

That same day, the Trump administration ""informed Mr Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning - precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office - to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever"".

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Mr Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded in a statement and said: ""A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community.

""This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Mr Garcia's attorneys, said he would ""fight tooth and nail against any form of deportation to Uganda"" or nearby countries in Africa.

""It is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn't even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options,"" he said. ""This family has suffered enough.""

However, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg appeared to suggest that deportation to Costa Rica might be favourable for his client, saying: ""That's a pretty reasonable option, right? I mean, Costa Rica makes sense.

""It's a Spanish-speaking country. It's proximate to the United States. His family can visit him there easily.""

Mr Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his American wife and son, was deported to El Salvador under a controversial 18th-century law. He was then imprisoned in its notorious maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

Democrat senator Chris Van Hollen, who met Mr Garcia in CECOT, said the 29-year-old was ""traumatised"" by the experience.

The Trump administration admitted that deporting Mr Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Mr Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Mr Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, US President Donald Trump, vice president JD Vance and other officials claim Mr Garcia was a member of MS-13 - an international criminal gang formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs.

Mr Garcia's lawyers strongly deny the claims.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/04/1600x900/skynews-kilmar-abrego-garcia_6876345.jpg?20250404233516,N,,2025-08-23 20:57:27.293788

Since June 23, the majority of flights operated by the Coast Guard C-27J Spartan fleet — at least 263 flights — are likely to have been for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), transferring immigrants to and from ICE’s nexus of detention centers in Alexandria, La., Harlingen, Texas, and the Florida Everglades camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” according to an analysis of public flight data.

On August 13 and August 22, Rolling Stone watched as federal agents loaded shackled immigrants onto Coast Guard aircraft in Baltimore.

The Coast Guard’s larger propeller aircraft, the HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules, also appear to be operating ICE flights, though to a lesser degree. Flight data for the C-130 fleet show at least eight flights to and from Alexandria or Harlingen since late June.

Like federal emergency funds being used for immigrant detention centers, and agents across the federal government being directed to snatch up delivery drivers in their militarized takeover of Washington D.C., the Coast Guard flights are yet another example of the Trump administration funneling vast federal resources toward its mass deportation machine.

“A Coast Guard C-27 conducted a mission today at the request of ICE and landed at BWI airport,” a Coast Guard spokesperson says, explaining: “The Coast Guard continues to surge assets and leverage its unique capabilities to protect America’s borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty by assisting with the national transport of aliens to designated locations where the Department of Defense will transport the aliens internationally.”

The spokesperson adds that “three USCG aircraft are currently being used” for ICE, which is consistent with the flight data for August 22. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment. ICE deferred to DHS.

Editor’s picks

“It seems like a misuse of Coast Guard assets to me,” says Tom Cartwright, the retired JPMorgan executive who has been tracking ICE flights since 2020. “And you have to wonder why it’s been kept so quiet.”

The Coast Guard, which is part of DHS, has a wide-ranging purview protecting U.S. maritime interests, which includes search-and-rescue missions, disaster response, and enforcing fishing laws. It also does drug and migrant interdiction, which generally means surveilling and intercepting suspected smuggling vessels in the water.

Coast Guard aircraft have been used for a handful of ICE flights in the past, but hauling prisoners across the country is far afield from its normal duties — particularly for the C-27, which until recently was primarily used for search and rescue.

The C-27 missions follow a similar pattern, leaving their stations in Clearwater, Fla., or Sacramento, Calif., flying to the ICE hubs of Alexandria or Harlingen, and spending the next week flying out-and-back trips to midsize cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Kansas City, and Tampa — “NFL cities,” as one activist, “JJ in DC,” describes them — where ICE has been active. Of eight Coast Guard C-27s that have operated since mid-June, all but one appears to have been dedicated to ICE flights. They have landed at the tent camp in the Everglades nine times beginning on July 23 and as recently as Thursday.

The trips have become so regular that JJ in DC was able to figure out their schedule and predict their next moves.

Rolling Stone went to a public parking lot next to a loading area at the back of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on August 13 to observe an incoming C-27.

Once it landed and taxied to the loading area, the aircraft’s back ramp opened and three vehicles pulled up toward it — an unmarked van, an unmarked SUV, and an SUV with a DHS seal. Federal agents and guards removed a shackled man from the aircraft and put him into the DHS SUV. Agents spent about an hour signing paperwork, chatting, and loading plastic bags holding immigrants’ belongings into the aircraft, while a Coast Guard pilot did a walk-around safety check for the next flight.

An agent carried an armful of chains to the van, and a short time later, seven people shackled at the hands and ankles were led from the van to the aircraft’s ramp, where they were patted down. All of them appeared to be men, ranging in age from late teens to forties. All appeared to be brown or Latino.

Once they were loaded onto the aircraft, the shackled man in the marked SUV was moved again to the unmarked van. Soon afterward, the agents appeared to notice they were being filmed from the public parking lot and put on hoodies and balaclavas. Two marched toward the fence dividing the loading area from the lot and filmed a random guy who had just parked there.

The man removed from the C-27 and one of the men loaded onto it were wearing gray sweatsuits often issued to immigrants in detention centers, while the other men were wearing their own clothes, suggesting ICE was transporting a mix of people who had been in their custody for some time and some who had been recently arrested.

On August 22, the C-27 parked in an area farther away from the public parking lot. About nine people in unidentified uniforms got off the aircraft from the boarding door and walked to a nearby charter jet. Federal agents then loaded several shackled people, at least one in a gray sweatsuit, up the back ramp. The charter jet flew to Charlotte, N.C.; the C-27 returned to Alexandria.

In addition to the midsize cities, Coast Guard has apparently operated ICE flights to these cities since late June: Biloxi, Mississippi; Columbus, Georgia; Dallas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Indianapolis; Knoxville, Tennessee; San Antonio; Springfield, Missouri; and Tallahassee. All are near ICE detention facilities.

Immigrants have long reported harsh conditions, safety problems and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by guards onboard ICE flights. Like the men in Baltimore, all adult passengers on ICE flights are shackled at the wrists and ankles. (This may be the case for some immigrant children, too.)

Flight attendants for GlobalX, which currently operates the majority of ICE flights, told ProPublica in April that when they raised concerns about how shackled passengers could safely evacuate in the event of an emergency, they were told to “just get up and leave.” In July, activists watching a Seattle airport livestream spotted ICE-contracted guards push to the ground a shackled immigrant with a hood over his head while boarding an ICE flight on Avelo Airlines.

Which detention centers people in ICE custody are transferred to is based largely on capacity, according to the agency, which often results in people being moved multiple times and hundreds or thousands of miles away from their homes. Advocacy groups say this cuts off immigrants from their families and legal assistance, and that frequent and capricious transfers can be used to punish people in ICE custody.

“We’re told that it is a question of logistics, sometimes it often appears that these transfers may be retaliatory in nature, because people are trying to access counsel,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “There is also a suspicion that authorities may be transferring people for more favorable case law in different areas of the country.”

For example, when Georgetown professor Badar Khan Suri was detained in March on specious allegations of ties to Hamas, he was sent on a week-long journey to five different facilities, each farther away from his home in Arlington, Virginia, according to court documents. He ended up in a dirty, overcrowded facility in Alvarado, Texas, despite there being plenty of room at two of the facilities in Virginia where he was briefly held. (Suri was released in May and settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration earlier this month.)

In another case first reported by Capital B News, Haitian national Rony Dieujuste was moved from Palm Beach County to Miami, then to Texas, Arizona, and California. At one facility, he and other detainees had unexplained nosebleeds; at another he slept on a bare metal platform. His American partner struggled to keep tabs on him using ICE’s detainee locator system and would only find out he’d been moved when he called her from a new facility, often in the middle of the night.

“I told him to remain strong. But he is breaking,” she told Capital B in June.

“It takes a huge toll on families, especially when they’re so far away,” Cho says. “It’s as if somebody has died or has disappeared.”

It is unclear how many times on average immigrants in ICE detention are transferred before their cases are resolved, because ICE does not release this data. Nor does it release data about its massive — and growing — air operation.

It’s that lack of transparency that compelled Cartwright, the former JPMorgan exec, to start tracking ICE flights nearly six years ago. He releases meticulous monthly reports frequently cited by the media.

“I just believe the public has a right to know what the scale of this operation is,” he says. “When things are opaque like this and basically totally dark, no one thinks about the people on the planes.”

Cartwright began noticing the Coast Guard’s presence in Alexandria and Harlingen in July, but did not include those flights in his statistics for the month because he wasn’t yet sure they were ICE flights. Now he is certain, he says, and he and Human Rights First — the nonprofit he recently announced is taking over his flight-tracking operation — are working to amend the June and July reports to include them. Even before the additions, Cartwright recorded more ICE flights in July than ever before — 727 domestic transfer flights and 207 deportation and third-country removal flights — on ICE’s network of charter airlines, private jets, and a growing number of military aircraft.

Cartwright also noted that when the Coast Guard assisted ICE in the past, it released public statements about that assistance. This time, the Coast Guard appears to have adopted ICE’s stance of saying little.

On Wednesday, NBC News reported that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wanted to use billions in funding from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” for ICE to buy and operate its own fleet of 30 or more aircraft. That same day, Air Force members received an email, obtained by journalist Marisa Kabas, inviting them to take part in a program “supporting border operations.”

Noem has been living rent-free in a spacious home designated for the Coast Guard commandant, The Washington Post reported last week. Trump fired the previous commandant, Admiral Linda Fagan, on the second day of his second term, accusing her of an “excessive focus” on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Bolton has thus far not commented on the raid.","Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official, signaled Saturday that he could be the next target of President Trump’s FBI after ex-national security adviser John Bolton’s Washington-area home was raided by agents early Friday.

Taylor, who served as a deputy chief of staff at DHS under Trump’s first term, was asked by MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart about the raid and whether he is concerned about the administration’s next moves.

“Yeah, we expect it. I mean, really, we expect it,” he told Capehart. “And that’s what is so surreal about this is we can all hear as we’re talking about this, be so certain of the president’s revenge campaign to know potentially who that next target might be or one of those next targets.”

The former DHS aide added, “I mean when my wife and I woke up and saw the news, she basically said to me, ‘It’s coming.'”

The FBI confirmed Friday that “court-authorized law enforcement activity” was conducted in the area of Bolton’s home in Bethesda, Md. The search was reportedly related to his handling of classified information.

The search of Bolton’s home and office marked an escalation in the feud between Trump and his former national security adviser, with critics seeing it as a potential act of retribution.

Taylor, who previously suggested the president kept a “blacklist” for persecution, said as much in his appearance Saturday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.”

“Folks don’t have to play the violin for John Bolton or Miles Taylor. Maybe they don’t like either of us. That’s fine, because it’s not about us,” he told the panel. “It’s about the criminal justice system that all Americans expect to be able to treat them fairly.”

“It’s a president of the U.S. weaponizing the tools of his office to reshape our society. And he’s doing that. He’s making sure the scales of justice tip in his favor,” he continued, adding later, “There’s no telling where this could go next.”

Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that he was not told ahead of time about the raid but expected to be briefed later. Bolton has often criticized his former boss over foreign policy decisions. He was also a witness during the president’s first impeachment probe.

Vice President Vance defended the FBI’s moves in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which will air Sunday, pushing back on allegations that the raid is related to retribution.

His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
“It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.” 113","NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.

The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.

Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.

Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.

Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.

“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.

Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”

“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.

Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.

The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.

The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

Court documents Saturday showed President Trump’s administration plans to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he turned down an offer to be sent to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges.

His case has attracted attention amid Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges, which the Maryland resident denies.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead attorney in his lawsuit against the Trump administration, said in a statement Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client by “attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language.”

Abrego Garcia’s attorney’s court filings show the administration requested he appear at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday and could be deported again.

In a statement Friday at his release, Abrego Garcia said he saw his family for the first time in more than five months.

“We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served,” he added.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denounced the decision to free Abrego Garcia, stating that the administration will not stop fighting until he’s out of the U.S.

The Trump administration casts him as an MS-13 gang member and immigrant smuggler.

Abrego Garcia and his attorneys reject those claims. They portray him as a family man and construction worker who was arbitrarily deported and vindictively charged.

As his story takes yet another turn, here’s what to know:

The Costa Rica-Uganda offer

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement told his attorneys he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities Monday.

Later Friday, the government told Abrego Garcia he has until first thing Monday to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table, his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the court brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, “A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes ... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.”

The Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he should report to immigration authorities on Monday in Baltimore to face deportation.

Uganda has agreed to a deal to accept certain migrants being deported from the United States.

‘Well-founded fear’ of returning to El Salvador

Abrego Garcia, 30, grew up in El Salvador and fled at 16 because a local gang extorted from and terrorized his family, court records state. He traveled to Maryland, where his brother lives as a U.S. citizen, but was not authorized to stay.

Abrego Garcia found work in construction and met his future wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. In 2018, he moved in with her and her two children after she became pregnant with their child.

In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he was detained by local police, court records state. He was suspected of being in MS-13, based on tattoos and clothing.

A criminal informant told police Abrego Garcia was in MS-13, court records state, but police did not charge him and turned him over to ICE.

A U.S. immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia’s subsequent asylum claim because more than a year had passed since his arrival. But the judge granted him protection from being deported to El Salvador, determining he had a “well-founded fear” of gang persecution there, court records state.

Abrego Garcia was released and placed under federal supervision. He received a federal work permit and checked in with ICE each year, his lawyers said.

‘Audacity to fight back’

In February, the Trump administration designated MS-13 a foreign terrorist organization. In March, it deported Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador, violating the U.S. immigration judge’s 2019 order.

Abrego Garcia later claimed in court documents that he was beaten and psychologically tortured while held at the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele denied the allegations.

The Trump administration described its violation of the immigration judge’s 2019 order as an administrative error. Trump and other officials reiterated claims that Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.

Vasquez Sura filed a lawsuit to bring her husband back. The Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in June after a Supreme Court order. But it brought human smuggling charges against him.

The smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving with nine passengers. Tennessee police suspected human smuggling, but allowed him to drive on and didn’t charge him.

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty.

His lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case based on “vindictive and selective prosecution.”

Deportation fears realized

U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes in Nashville ruled in June that Abrego Garcia has a right to be released from jail while he awaits trial.

But Abrego Garcia remained in a Tennessee jail at his attorneys’ request for about 11 weeks over fears that ICE would immediately try to deport him.

Thomas Giles, an assistant director for ICE, testified in July that Abrego Garcia would be detained as soon as he’s freed.

U.S. officials argued Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because an immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Judge provides some protections

In response to concerns Abrego Garcia would be deported without due process, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis prohibited ICE from immediately detaining him upon release in Tennessee.

Xinis, overseeing the lawsuit in Maryland, ordered restrictions on ICE in late July. She required any removal proceedings begin in Baltimore.

Xinis also ordered that ICE provide three business days’ notice if it intends to initiate removal proceedings.

The Trump administration has “done little to assure the Court that, absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected,” Xinis wrote.

Electronic monitoring and home detention

Soon after Xinis’ order, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys asked the federal judge in Tennessee to release him.

Holmes, the U.S. magistrate in Nashville, released him Friday, requiring Abrego Garcia to stay with his brother in Maryland and be subjected to electronic monitoring and home detention.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cda1f0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/10934x5740+0+774/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F29%2F17%2F6eba3c0f4869a240854c2aedeba4%2Fd735ec074dc04cf9a6b8e904c244352b.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 18:57:02.071125

The Foreign Secretary has ramped up security efforts to prevent would-be asylum seekers from reaching the UK amid concern over a “spike” in attempts.

Government officials have noted a big increase in the number of people from sub-Saharan Africa trying to enter Britain on fake student and healthcare visas.

It comes as Labour struggles to grapple with the small boats crisis, which has seen asylum applications hit a record 111,000 during its first year in office.

Sir Keir Starmer is under huge pressure to significantly cut levels of illegal migration after Reform pledged to run five deportation flights a day if it wins power.

The Foreign Office has dispatched immigration experts to countries in West Africa, including Ghana and Nigeria, to try to shut off the air route into the UK.

British officials are working with local police to crack down on people smugglers and helping airline staff to improve security checks and spot fake visas.

Mr Lammy said: “Tackling irregular migration demands cooperation across borders and industries to disrupt the pathways used by those attempting to enter the UK illegally.

“We are strengthening partnerships with our partners in West Africa, the airline industry, and enforcement agencies, to secure our borders and deliver on the Plan for Change.

“Together we are sending a clear message – air travel simply isn’t an option without proper authorisation and registration.”

‘Spike’

Ministers said that last year saw a “spike” in the number of fraudulent attempts to enter the UK by air with fake documents from sub-Saharan Africa.

More than 250 would-be asylum seekers were stopped, with student and health and social care visas amongst those that are most commonly forged.

Some of those people were then arrested and successfully prosecuted in their home countries for attempting to illegally travel to Britain.

Smuggling routes

Ministers have also stepped up joint policing efforts with Western African nations to try to take down organised crime groups running smuggling routes.

UK experts are working with the local authorities in Ghana to trace the gangs that are supplying false travel documents to migrants.

Similar work is under way in Nigeria, where an Organised Immigration Crime Unit has been set up to target smugglers exploiting the UK visa system.

It comes as Sir Keir is under growing pressure after figures showed that asylum claims and the number of migrants in hotels are up under his government.

There were 111,000 asylum claims in the year to June, up 14 per cent on the previous year and higher than the previous peak of 103,000 in 2002.

The number of migrants in hotels also rose during Labour’s first 12 months in office to 32,059, though it remains below the 2023 peak of 56,000.

Sir Keir has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels, which have become the scene of protests across the country over the last few weeks.

Nigel Farage has looked to capitalise on growing public anger over the Prime Minister’s failure so far to bear down on illegal immigration.

This weekend, the Reform leader unveiled a blueprint for the “mass deportation” of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers if he wins the next election.

He told The Times that he would pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights and launch five deportation flights every single day.

Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is reviewing the application of the ECHR in British courts, especially around the right to family life.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was released from a Tennessee jail on Friday, is now facing deportation to the East African country of Uganda, according to court documents shared by his lawyers on Saturday.

Abrego Garcia turned down a deal to be sent to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges. Now the administration has requested his appearance at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday, at which point he would be facing a second deportation.

Why does the Trump administration care so much about Abrego Garcia?

The case of Abrego Garcia has been a messy ordeal for the government. He was initially swept up as part of Trump's war on undocumented migrants.

Abrego Garcia has a US wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. However, he immigrated to the United States illegally.

The White House depicted him as a member of the violent MS-13 gang and a people smuggler, justifying his deportation to a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador.

However, Abrego Garcia was under a court protection, issued in 2019, saying that he faced ""well-founded fears"" of violence if he was returned to his home country.

The US Supreme Court ordered the US government to ""facilitate"" his return after the Trump administration admitted it had sent him there by mistake.

He was returned in June, and then detained and charged with smuggling undocumented migrants. On Friday, he was released from the Putnam County Jail in Cookville, Tennessee, on the basis of a judge's order.

Abrego Garcia sees family again for first time in over 160 days

The legal struggle over Abrego Garcia's future has turned him, to some extent, into the face of those impacted by Trump's hardline immigrant policies.

His lawyers have called the government's continued pursuit of their client a vindictive attempt to punish his challenging of the original deportation.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reacted with anger over his release on Friday, saying the administration will continue until ""this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.""

At the same time, migrant rights organization CASA released a statement quoting Abrego Garcia as saying it was a ""very special day"" after seeing his family for the first time in almost six months.

""We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served,"" Abrego Garcia said, according to CASA, which described him as a ""symbol of strength, resistance and hope.""

The truck Francisco Longoria was driving the morning of August 16 was parked in the driveway of his home, where Friday's news conference took place. A smashed window and bullet holes could be seen on the passenger side of the vehicle.

""We're here to call upon city, county and state officials, asking them to investigate this shooting because there is a lot that we don't know,"" attorney Jason Sanchez said at the news conference.

Both parties involved, the Department of Homeland Security and Longoria, have differing versions of events on August 16.

According to an Aug. 17 DHS summary of the event, a person refused to exit his vehicle during an attempted traffic stop while a targeted immigration enforcement operation was taking place. The agency said the man ""drove his car at the officers,"" striking two.

At that point, the officers fired multiple shots at the vehicle, which had three people inside at the time. No one was struck and the driver escaped the scene.

Longoria's account, as told by his attorneys, claims that he was driving home when several people stopped him in an unmarked car. Individuals wearing different uniforms and masks approached his truck, ""some with guns drawn, and attempted to gain access to his vehicle, without identifying themselves and without presenting a warrant,"" Sanchez said. ""They then smashed the window in an attempt to gain entry to the vehicle and hit Mr. Longoria.""

Shots were allegedly fired into the passenger side of the truck where the teenager was sitting, as Longoria fled, according to attorneys. Sanchez said at the news conference that DHS has identified the masked individuals as their agents, and he said they claim they were acting in self-defense.

Longoria's family said earlier that he has lived in the United States for 23 years but has been continually denied citizenship. His three children are U.S. citizens and the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice said earlier that the man has no criminal record.

""Where is their warrant? Why were they shooting if they feared they were going to be run over? Why were they shooting at the passenger side of the vehicle? Where are those bullet casings? Where is any other video? Why if there was a shooting, hasn't there been an investigation yet?"" Sanchez said.

""Those are the answers we would like to know.""

And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors.
While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross.
Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president.
No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.","Republican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.

On Aug. 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force.

Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a white man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.

“Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won’t be mayor very long because we’ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it’s supposed to be run,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday, calling the city a “crime-infested rat hole.”

Earlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.

Using the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.

And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.

While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”

“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.

“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”

For Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit.

In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.

Though Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.

“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”

Victoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.

“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”

Wendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.

“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”

The manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.

The president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.

Crockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”

Black women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.

Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”

In Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.

“I thought: ‘Hell no,’” Collier said in a video released to the public.

Collier settled in for her long night on the House floor with a blue eye mask and white-and-red blankets and a small Texas flag that marked a page in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” She abruptly left a video call with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday after someone off screen informed her she faced a felony charge for speaking from the Capitol.

Scott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now. Mayors are able to directly communicate with constituents in ways that may have been more limited in the past. Plus, social media platforms allow the public to see the impact of troops on the streets in these heavily Democratic communities where they are not welcomed.

“There’s a narrative that’s being placed on them, but they’re able to negate those narratives by what they themselves put out there on social media,” she said. “These are folks who are not shying away from the media … they want to talk about what they’re doing.”

The lawsuit, filed Friday in the federal court's Middle District of Florida, is the third major legal challenge to the detention center, erected by the DeSantis administration as part of the state's support of President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

Lawsuit argues that federal agreements don't give state agencies authority to operate detention centers

DeSantis and state officials maintain that they are operating the facility through what are known as 287(g) agreements, which local governments can enter with the federal government to provide training and authority to local police to help enforce immigration laws.

But the lawsuit filed Friday contends that the agreements do not give authority to state agencies or their contractors to run detention centers and that the officers who are working at the Everglades facility lack federally required training to participate in immigration-enforcement efforts.

""The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court,"" the lawsuit said.

Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, ""are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,"" the lawyers argued.

The 287(g) agreements are part of a federal law known as 1357(g) that allows states to support federal immigration-enforcement efforts.

""This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,"" the lawsuit said. ""In the thirty years since the statute was enacted, state officers have never claimed the authority to detain people under this statute, other than the short period after an arrest during transport to an ICE facility.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of a detainee identified as ""M.A."" and also are seeking class-action certification in the challenge.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.

The federal law ""does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process. And it certainly does not let them place detention in the hands of untrained, unsupervised private contractors who are not and cannot be deputized to perform immigration functions. By ignoring these standards, Florida has created exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,"" the lawsuit said.

Questions about Florida's authority were asked in other lawsuits

Questions about the state's authority to run the facility also have been raised in two other legal challenges.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Thursday sided with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida in a lawsuit alleging that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study be conducted before the detention center was erected.

Williams' order gave the state 60 days to begin winding down the facility. Lawyers for DeSantis quickly asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals to put her ruling on hold while the state's appeal proceeds.

Lawyers for DeSantis have argued, in part, in that case that the federal environmental law did not apply because the state is operating the facility.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning, the governor — who has fiercely defended the state's immigrant-detention efforts — shrugged off Williams' decision.

""We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do. This is not anything that was unexpected, but we will make sure to get the job done in the end,"" he said.

In a separate lawsuit, attorneys representing detainees allege that people being held at the center have inadequate access to legal representation and confidential meetings with their attorneys.

The latest legal challenge said that court records in the other cases show the facility is ""Florida-owned and Florida-operated.""

""State and federal officials have stated in court filings that Florida exercises 'complete discretion' over operations and over who is detained at the facility,"" Thursday's lawsuit said.

Numerous state agencies have 287(g) agreements allowing their law-enforcement officers to participate in immigration efforts, the lawsuit noted.

""But those agreements do not give any authority to the state agencies themselves — only to those individual employees who have been fully trained and certified by DHS (Department of Homeland Security),"" the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also said it is unknown how many state officers working at the facility have completed federally required training, which can take months.

DeSantis earlier this month announced that the state plans to convert a shuttered state prison in Baker County into a second immigrant-detention center. That facility will be staffed by members of Florida's National Guard.

The Florida Department of Emergency Management is set to receive $605 million from the Trump administration for the state's immigrant-detention efforts. The department hired contractors to help build and operate the Everglades facility, which can hold up to 4,000 people and is estimated to cost roughly $450 million per year.

The lawsuit alleges that federal law does not allow the private contractors to be ""deputized to perform any immigration functions.""

The lawsuit also alleges that workers at the facility are pressuring detainees to sign voluntary deportation orders.

Gov. Spencer Cox during his monthly news conference, saying Utah has not received direct communication from Washington about potential involvement.

“As a dual-authority state, like others, the federal government does have the opportunity to call up the National Guard. The president has that authority,” Cox said. “What we’ve said from the very beginning is this: we are willing to work to support the efforts to remove people who are here illegally. However, with a couple caveats.”

Cox said Utah troops would only serve in support roles.

“Our National Guard will not be putting hands on people, will not be arresting people. That is not the role of the National Guard, and we would not allow that to happen,” he said.

He added that Utah has previously offered help with transportation since the state does not have an ICE facility. Moving detainees, he said, often pulls Homeland Security staff away from processing and other responsibilities.

Cox outlined two conditions for participation: The Guard would only assist with support functions, and the federal government must cover all costs.

“That’s where we would be able to help. Condition number one. Condition number two is that the federal government has to pay for this. It can’t come out of state funding,” Cox said. “We’re in active communication with the federal government, and I think that’s true of most states.”

Utah National Guard officials later confirmed they have received a request from the Department of Defense seeking volunteers.

“Yes, we can confirm Utah National Guard has received a request from the Department of Defense through normal channels for volunteers for administrative and clerical support for Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement,” said Lt. Col. Chris H. Kroeber, public affairs officer for the Utah National Guard.

He said the Guard does not yet know what that support will involve and is in the “question-and-answer stages,” working through logistics. The request still requires approval from Cox, though Kroeber said the expectation is that the governor will sign off. Funding, he added, would come from the federal government.

When asked if he would approve deploying Utah troops to other states, Cox said he does not expect that scenario.

“We’ve had the need to deploy the National Guard here before, when we’ve had riots and property damage in Utah when lives were at risk. We’re hoping we don’t need to do that here,” Cox said. “Our job is to make sure we don’t need the National Guard in Utah.”

The issue was also discussed on this week’s , who raised questions about federal authority in Washington, D.C., and whether Trump could expand his efforts to other cities.

John Dougal, former state auditor, said he is uneasy with the trend of relying on the Guard for civilian matters.

“I have serious concerns, law enforcement is trained differently than the military. I hate the fact that we keep deploying the National Guard to this, that and the other,” Dougal said. “I think they have a certain duty they should respond to, and we should not deploy them on all sorts of other matters.”

Dougal also questioned Trump’s reach.

“When the president starts talking about other cities and other places, he doesn’t have the authority to do that,” he said.

Maura Carabello of the Exoro Group said she believes this move is more about showmanship than governance.

“He deploys the military and 48 hours later says 'huzzah, problem solved, children are smarter in D.C.' He will move on to his next victory because that is part of his story arc,” Carabello said.

She argued that the approach is not geared toward long-term solutions.

“He’s not about long-term sustainable solutions; he is about his legacy and what he can do for us, and so I don’t even think he’s looking at public policy. This is not a serious attempt to solve a problem,” she said.

The Home Secretary said yesterday the Home Office will seek to appeal against the injunction forcing migrants to be removed from the Bell Hotel in Epping.

Ms Cooper warned the asylum system would be plunged into 'chaos' if migrant hotels were forced to close as a result of 'piecemeal court decisions' by councils bringing copycat litigation.

It comes after a judge ordered the hotel to temporarily shut after Epping Forest District Council argued it was necessary for 'the safety of nearby residents' and to reduce the threat of 'violent protests'.

Meanwhile, police forces were braced for a wave of protests at hotels across the country this weekend as communities seek to replicate the results of Tuesday's High Court ruling.

The first protests took place in nine towns and cities including Cardiff, Bournemouth, Leeds and Leicester last night – with a total of 32 expected to take place this Bank Holiday weekend.

Yesterday Ms Cooper sought to head off Epping-style legal challenges and avoid the ugly scenes seen during last summer's riots as the Government took the first steps to appeal against the court ruling which gave her until September 12 to move asylum seekers out of the Bell Hotel.

The Home Secretary said: 'We agree with communities across the country that all asylum hotels need to close, including the Bell Hotel, and we are working to do so as swiftly as possible as part of an orderly, planned and sustained programme.

'That is the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way.'

But Tory Chris Philp branded the hotel injunction 'a victory for local people'.

He said: 'It is completely wrong that the Labour Government is taking legal action to keep open the Bell Hotel.

The move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. He had been held there since he was returned to the United States in June to face federal human smuggling charges, which he denies.

In the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment.

Abrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay. His attorneys write that ""within minutes of his release"" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that ""the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,"" ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning.

His attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.

""On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning—precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office—to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his attorneys say.

""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" Abrego Garcia's lawyers write.

His attorneys say in the filing that the administration's threat of deportation to Uganda supports their motion to dismiss the smuggling charges on account of vindictive and selective prosecution.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.

Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE on March 12 and deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador three days later in what the Trump administration has since called an ""administrative error.""

Legal, environmental, and reputational risks are no longer isolated incidents but systemic challenges that could reshape the sector.
For CoreCivic and GEO Group, the path forward hinges on their ability to reconcile profit motives with ethical and regulatory demands.","The U.S. immigration detention system has become a focal point of systemic risk for investors, particularly as state-federal partnerships expand under politically charged agendas. The second Trump administration's aggressive push to reopen and scale detention centers—operated by private prison giants CoreCivic (CXW) and GEO Group (GEO)—has created a volatile landscape marked by legal battles, environmental controversies, and reputational damage. For investors, the intersection of policy, profit, and public accountability demands a rigorous assessment of these risks.

Legal Liabilities: A Growing Minefield

The legal challenges facing CoreCivic and GEO Group are no longer hypothetical. The 2025 Washington State Supreme Court ruling mandating minimum wage for detainee labor forced GEO Group to replace unpaid labor with paid staff, costing the company an estimated $17.3 million in back pay and operational adjustments. This precedent, upheld by the Ninth Circuit, threatens to ripple across the industry, as similar lawsuits in California and Colorado test the applicability of state labor laws to federal contractors.

The companies' reliance on “guaranteed minimums” in contracts—where the federal government pays for beds regardless of occupancy—has also drawn scrutiny. A 2023 Office of Inspector General report revealed $160 million in payments for unused capacity at 17 facilities, exposing inefficiencies that could trigger further legal and financial penalties. Meanwhile, state-level lawsuits, such as Leavenworth, Kansas's challenge to CoreCivic's unpermitted detention center, underscore the tension between federal enforcement priorities and local governance.

Environmental and ESG Compliance: A Fragile Facade

While CoreCivic and GEO Group tout ESG initiatives, their operations remain mired in environmental and ethical controversies. The “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida, for instance, drew bipartisan condemnation in July 2025 for conditions including excessive heat, infestations, and inadequate sanitation. Despite ICE's National Detention Standards (NDS) mandating environmental health safeguards, enforcement remains inconsistent.

The lack of state-level oversight exacerbates these risks. Unlike state-run prisons, immigration detention centers are often exempt from local inspections, creating a regulatory vacuum. A 2024 GAO report highlighted ICE's failure to ensure sustained compliance with environmental standards, while Amnesty International and the ACLU documented violations such as poor air quality and unsafe temperatures. These issues not only violate ESG principles but also expose investors to reputational harm as public scrutiny intensifies.

Reputational Risks: A Booming Sector, A Shrinking Social License

The reputational toll on CoreCivic and GEO Group is evident. GEO Group's 2025 appeal of the Washington minimum wage ruling has been framed as a defense of “profit over people” by advocacy groups, while CoreCivic's Leavenworth facility has been labeled an “absolute hell hole” by a federal judge. Such narratives, amplified by media coverage and social media, erode trust and pressure institutional investors to divest.

Morningstar Sustainalytics has assigned both companies a “medium” ESG risk rating, citing persistent human rights concerns. Yet the broader market has shown resilience: CoreCivic and GEO Group's stock prices surged post-2024 amid Trump's re-election and the $45 billion immigration funding bill. This disconnect between ESG metrics and market performance raises questions about the long-term sustainability of their business models.

Investment Implications: Navigating a High-Risk Sector

For investors, the immigration detention sector presents a paradox. While political tailwinds and federal contracts offer short-term gains, the compounding risks of legal penalties, environmental violations, and reputational damage could undermine long-term value. Key considerations include:

1. Litigation Exposure: Monitor ongoing lawsuits in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which could force nationwide wage reforms.

2. ESG Alignment: Assess how ESG rating agencies might downgrade CoreCivic and GEO Group if compliance failures persist.

3. Policy Volatility: The sector's dependence on partisan agendas (e.g., Trump's detention expansion vs. Biden's alternatives-to-detention policies) introduces political risk.

Investors should also weigh the ethical implications of funding a system criticized for exploiting vulnerable populations. While the sector's profitability is tied to political cycles, the growing emphasis on corporate accountability and ESG compliance suggests a potential reckoning. Diversification or hedging against policy shifts may be prudent strategies.

Conclusion: A Call for Prudent Caution

The expansion of state-federal immigration detention infrastructure under the Trump administration has created a high-stakes environment for investors. Legal, environmental, and reputational risks are no longer isolated incidents but systemic challenges that could reshape the sector. For CoreCivic and GEO Group, the path forward hinges on their ability to reconcile profit motives with ethical and regulatory demands. Investors, meanwhile, must navigate this landscape with a clear-eyed understanding of the risks—and the potential for a paradigm shift in how detention is funded, governed, and perceived.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 17:58:20.692598

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP’S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE The news comes as almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers from Washington DC and six states have been deployed to support law enforcement in Washington DC.
At the authorization of Secretary Hegseth, those National Guard members can now carry weapons if needed for their individual tasks.
A U.S. Defense official said while the mobilizations in 19 states and activation of DC National Guard both fall under President Trump’s larger directive protecting territorial integrity and immigration policies, the missions are distinct and separate.
""Bottom line: The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President’s actions to stop crime in D.D.,"" the official added.","Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are set to mobilize in 19 states in the coming weeks to assist the Department of Homeland Security with President Trump’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, Pentagon officials confirmed to FOX News.

Documents obtained by FOX News show planning for activations in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming – with status effective from August through mid-November. Texas is projected to host the most significant Guard presence.

The National Guard soldiers being mobilized will effectively serve as a support pillar to a sweeping federal interagency effort, while also serving as a visible deterrent force, a U.S. Defense official said. The service members supporting ICE will be preforming case management, transportation, logistical support, and clerical functions associated with the processing of illegal migrants at the facilities. ""The in-and-out processing may include personal data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing of personnel in ICE custody,"" the official said.

TRUMP JOINS POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES IN WASHINGTON STREETS

President Trump has indicated in recent days his administration aims to broaden the DC operation to other states, telling a group of federal agents and National Guard troops at a DC patrol center Thursday, ""We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places.""

On Friday in the Oval Office, Trump said, ""I think Chicago will be our next. And then we'll help with New York,"" Trump said.

A U.S. Defense official told FOX, ""We won’t speculate on further operations, but can tell you that the department is a planning organization and continues to work and plan with other agency partners to protect federal assets and personnel.""

Fewer than 2% of the authorized forces have mobilized so far, but missions coordinated under state governors are projected to expand in the coming weeks – including in Virginia, where approximately 60 soldiers and airmen will begin training August 25th to begin duty by early September, the Virginia National Guard confirmed.

""VNG personnel will not conduct law enforcement functions, and VNG support will not include making arrests,"" a spokesperson for the Virginia National Guard tells FOX. ""VNG Soldiers and Airmen will report directly to ICE leadership at their assigned duty locations but remain under the control and direction of the Virginia Governor and Adjutant General of Virginia.""

The deployment of National Guard troops — a state-controlled reserve force — will allow the U.S. military to provide a more direct role in supporting federal immigration enforcement amid as the Trump administration pushes forward with mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, use of the military for civilian law enforcement is limited – but the National Guardsmen will be mobilizing under Title 32 Section 502F authority, to which Posse Comitatus does not apply. At the request of DHS, in July, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved hundreds of additional forces for DHS-ICE Interior Enforcement support, and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status.

""We understood ICE’s needs at that time to be more administrative in nature…as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different,"" a U.S. defense official told FOX.

Service members supporting ICE will be performing case management, transportation, clerical functions, and logistical support – which may include data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swapping, and photographing of personnel in ICE custody.

""As you can imagine and appreciate, some of those start to get close to that law enforcement line. So it's best that these people are in a Title 32 status so that we are absolutely staying within the law of what we're doing and providing the appropriate support,"" the official said.

Most deployments remain in the planning and coordination stage with DHS and governors, but documents show operations beginning in Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada during the first week of September.

""Under Title 32, the guardsmen are under the command and control of their governors. So, it's up to the governors when they'll bring those forces …as the governors and the states coordinate with DHS, that timeline will differ state by state,"" the defense official said. Vermont declined to activate its National Guardsmen, despite the authorization from the Pentagon to assist the DHS-ICE Interior Enforcement Mission.

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP’S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE

The news comes as almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers from Washington DC and six states have been deployed to support law enforcement in Washington DC. Under direct presidential authority, Guard members were assigned to posts at monuments, checkpoints, and traffic stops in all eight wards, with a mission focused on deterring crime and keeping a visible security presence around the city.

At the authorization of Secretary Hegseth, those National Guard members can now carry weapons if needed for their individual tasks. But DC is different under Title 32. For the states it would be up to the individual governors who act as command and control.

A U.S. Defense official said while the mobilizations in 19 states and activation of DC National Guard both fall under President Trump’s larger directive protecting territorial integrity and immigration policies, the missions are distinct and separate.

""The big question is how long do we stay? Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.

Officials have tied the effort in Washington DC to beautification ahead of next year's 250th Independence Day celebration. But President Trump has hinted he may request the Guard stay in DC for an extended period of time, and then take the operation to other parts of the country.

""We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places,"" Trump said to a crowd of National Guardsmen and federal law enforcement at a DC patrol center this week.

The White House emphasized that planning for National Guard activations in 19 states for DHS logistical support preceded President Trump’s comments within the last 48 hours about replicating enforcement efforts seen in Washington, D.C., in other parts of the country.

""This isn’t new, nor is it tied to the President’s efforts to address violent crime in DC. DoD announced last month that National Guard troops would assist DHS with clerical support and other logistical tasks for processing illegal aliens at ICE facilities,"" a White House official said. ""It is separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown.

Many people, including some of the president’s “Make America Great Again” base have pressured Trump’s DOJ to release more files.","President Trump on Friday said he wouldn’t object to the release of all files tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as requested by the House Oversight Committee.

“I’m in support of them keeping it open. Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, when asked how he felt about the release of documents. “I couldn’t care less.”

“You’ve got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be, you know, people, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach,” he added.

His comments came as the Department of Justice (DOJ) released its first batch of Epstein files to Congress. The move came in response to a subpoena from the Oversight Committee seeking transparency around the documents following weeks of turmoil over the Trump administration’s handling of the case.

The Epstein saga came back into light last month after DOJ and the FBI issued a joint memo concluding that the disgraced financier did not keep a “client list” and that additional documents did not need to be released to the public. The findings rivaled what Attorney General Pam Bondi had suggested months prior, which raised questions on both sides of the aisle around the administration’s vow to be transparent with its probe.

Epstein, who died in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was known to hang out in circles with wealthy businessmen, celebrities and powerful politicians. A Wall Street Journal article earlier this year shed light on Trump’s relationship with the late financier, which the president has brushed off.

Trump said Friday that he’s directed Bondi to provide Congress members with “everything you can give them” amid the narrative that his administration is hiding information.

“The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax,” he added. “So, we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don’t know what to do, so they keep bringing up that stuff. But it affected them.”

Former President Clinton’s name has also been tied to Epstein, after he allegedly flew more than a dozen times on the convicted sex offender’s plane. Comer said he will be a “prime suspect” in its probe, as lawmakers review the documents.

Polling has shown that most U.S. adults disapprove of the way the Trump administration has handled the Epstein investigation. Many people, including some of the president’s “Make America Great Again” base have pressured Trump’s DOJ to release more files.

The department, at the president’s request, asked the courts to release the grand jury testimonies from Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell — who is serving a 20-year sentence. However, all three requests have been rejected.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has met twice with Maxwell, who was moved to a lower-security prison last month, and the transcript from their conversations were also made public on Friday.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Donald-Trump-Epstein-files-08.23.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-23 14:56:33.139022

Homeland Security officials say President Donald Trump's sweeping mass deportation campaign requires a build-up of detention centers to bridge the gap between arrests and removals. They've turned to the U.S. military and private contractors to get the job done, including erecting the nation's largest immigrant detention site on Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

But stewards of Japanese American history, including the children and grandchildren of those who were held in detention, are criticizing the use of Fort Bliss and the plans to expand immigrant detention on American military bases.

Fort Bliss was a ""cog"" in the United States Japanese internment machine, said Brian Niiya, a historian and content director at Densho, a nonprofit that chronicles Japanese American internment.

Niiya's own grandfather, the managing editor of a Japanese language newspaper, was arrested the night of Japan's Pearl Harbor attack, on Dec. 7, 1941, in Honolulu and held in six different internment camps over the next two years.

""It’s important to look to this past to maybe try to understand what’s going on in the present and what the end results could be,"" he said.

DHS: Detaining the 'worst of the worst'

The Fort Bliss facility known locally as Camp East Montana rises like a white tent city on a flat desert plain. It falls within the confines of the military base but is visible from El Paso's bustling Montana Avenue and sits adjacent to an unmarked building that is the local headquarters of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

At a cost of $1.2 billion, the camp has capacity to detain 5,000 people. Roughly 1,000 men were being held there in mid-August, according to U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, an El Paso Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, called comparisons between detention centers for people in the country illegally and World War II internment camps “deranged and lazy.”

""The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst – including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists"" she said in a statement.

A Cato Institute analysis of government data in June found ICE was arresting four times more non-criminals each week on the streets than people with convictions. ICE's own data show that 45% of the roughly 59,000 people in custody in mid-August had no criminal record or charges.

Mike Ishii, executive director and co-founder of Tsuru for Solidarity, an immigrant rights advocacy group, said he sees parallels with the current administration “coming in and removing people from their homes, from their workplaces, often with no explanations.”

Ishii, whose family was held at the Minidoka concentration camp in Idaho, said, “Right now, it's very frightening for people,” he said. “In 1941, it was also frightening.”

'No accounts of wrongdoing'

Eighty years ago, Fort Bliss housed dozens of people labeled ""alien enemies"" by the government in a detention camp that included two compounds surrounded by double barbed wire fences, according to Densho.

Smaller numbers of immigrants from Germany and Italy were also sent there after the United States joined European Allies and declared war against those countries.

At least 113 first-generation Japanese Americans were shipped to the base before being sent to other holding areas across the country, according to records compiled by Ireizō, a nonprofit database of Japanese Americans held in internment.

The people detained at Bliss were immigrants. They would be the first in the eventual internment of over 125,000 Japanese Americans across the country, most of them U.S. citizens.

For the vast majority, ""there were no accounts of wrongdoing other than being seen as 'enemy aliens,'"" said Karen Umemoto, director of the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The 1798 Alien Enemies Act

After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the American government viewed Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans as potential traitors, Umemoto said. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt immediately invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to detain people and confiscate their property.

Trump invoked the same law this year to designate some immigrants as ""alien enemies"" and target them for rapid deportation. The Supreme Court has blocked him on certain removals.

The Biden administration also used Fort Bliss to house migrants who crossed the border as unaccompanied children.

Under Biden, the Fort Bliss ""emergency intake site"" run by a private contractor was used to process the children for admission into the United States – not for deportation. Still, survivors and descendants of Japanese internment staged a protest at the facility in 2021 to call attention to the poor conditions there, including problems related to child safety and case management that were later documented in a 2022 federal report.

Asked about the base's history of internment, the Pentagon referred USA TODAY to an Aug. 7 news briefing in which spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson said Fort Bliss would ""be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission, the deportation of illegal aliens.""

Learning lessons from history

At midday on Aug. 21, construction and passenger vehicles came and went from the Fort Bliss camp. Puffy, storybook clouds hung in a pale blue sky.

There was no signage on the road in to announce the facility, other than warnings affixed to plywood: ""All vehicles subject to search. No cameras, cellphones or video recorders allowed.""

As historians, Niiya said, ""we always used to say that it's important to know this (history) so that we can prevent things from ever happening again… But perhaps we can't say that anymore.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/22/USAT/85784061007-usatsi-21475291-168402929-lowres.jpg?crop=1799,1013,x0,y93&width=1799&height=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-23 13:57:01.311827

The court filing on Saturday said the idea of sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda came after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation from the US to El Salvador earlier this year.

Abrego Garcia’s case has become a flashpoint in Trump’s hardline, anti-immigration agenda after the Salvadoran national was mistakenly deported in March.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the US in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

The Costa Rica offer came late on Thursday, after it was clear that Abrego Garcia would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day.

Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family.

Later that day, the US Department of Homeland Security notified his lawyers that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

“The government immediately responded to Mr Abrego’s release with outrage,” Saturday’s filing by Abrego Garcia’s lawyers reads.

“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.”

The filing also accuses US officials of “using their collective powers to force Mr Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat”.

“It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness,” it says.

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Trump administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a defence.

Questions on due process

Abrego Garcia had been living in the US under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers in the US.

But Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia – who denies any wrongdoing – now stands accused of involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries into the US between 2016 and earlier this year.

His trial in his human smuggling case is set to begin in January 2027.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said in a social media post on Saturday that “no matter what you think about Mr Abrego Garcia, if you believe in due process, you should be infuriated” by the effort to send him to Uganda.

“The Trump admin is threatening to dump him in Africa as punishment for not pleading guilty to criminal charges they brought to avoid complying with a court order,” Reichlin-Melnick wrote on X.

The Trump administration has defended its policies, saying the US president was elected on a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in the country’s history.

But Washington’s push to deport people has drawn widespread criticism, with removals to third countries, in particular, fuelling fears that those being sent abroad could face human rights abuses and other dangers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25092821230554_wide-1744658478.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&quality=80,N,,2025-08-23 13:56:53.992092

A new Pew Research Center analysis of census data found about 1.5 million immigrants have left the U.S. this year.

The data doesn't say exactly who is leaving, but the report notes the drop is likely driven by a fall in the number of unauthorized immigrants amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The White House tells Scripps News the data shows President Trump is ""Delivering on his promise"" to carry out mass deportation.

""Fewer immigrants means more job opportunities, higher wages, better benefits, better job security,"" said Kevin Lynn, with the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which opposes increased immigration.

But some economists worry a declining immigrant population could have a negative economic impact.

Hassan has researched how immigration impacts the labor market.

""When you deport a large number of people, they essentially take the jobs that they had with them,"" Hassan said.

“This is a separate mission from the D.C. support mission. Additional questions on personnel support to ICE should be directed to the individual states supporting the mission,” the spokesperson said.

As ICE — facing a quota administration officials have put at 3,000 arrests per day — is carrying out raids in more public places, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a series of statements describing what it says are escalating levels of risk its officers now face. ICE said assaults on officers increased 500% in June, then in July said the increase was 700%. Earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed ICE now faces a 1,000% increase in assaults. To date, the agency has not shared data to back up these claims.

Individual news reports document various cases of people accused of interfering with ICE officers.

On June 19, Arturo Hermosillo was detained after filming an ICE raid in a parking lot. He said agents told him that he obstructed their path by not moving his car correctly. He was held for several hours in the Department of Homeland Security building in Los Angeles and released without charges.

Job Garcia, a grad student, was detained while filming a raid at a Home Depot after he shouted at an undocumented truck driver not to open the door when agents approached. He was held in a federal jail in Los Angeles for over 24 hours before he was released with no explanation or charges, according to a federal civil claim he later filed.

Adrian Martínez, an employee at a Walmart in Pico Rivera, was jailed for three days after he attempted to intervene to keep ICE from arresting an elderly janitor. A U.S. attorney originally claimed that Martínez punched an ICE agent in the face, but security footage from the Walmart showed the agents throwing Martínez to the ground instead. Martínez is facing a felony charge of impeding or interfering with a federal agent and is working to get the case dismissed in court.

Rosenbaum says that ICE agents are not always following the law, but bystanders’ rights to observe them couldn’t be more clear, regardless of their immigration status.

“Even if you’re a citizen of Mars, you’re allowed to film the government,” he says.

Thornier, though, is the question of what constitutes interference.

Any physical contact with an officer could be considered assault, and any loud noise or disturbance, like shouting or blocking an ICE vehicle, is similarly classified as obstruction, Rosenbaum says.

Any U.S. citizen who is detained has the right to swift processing and access to a lawyer, even if they are not under arrest. This detention should last only a “reasonable” amount of time, with the sole purpose of determining whether a crime occurred.

And unless your phone holds potential evidence related to a crime, it would be against the Fourth Amendment for ICE agents to seize it. “It’s hard to imagine a circumstance in which it would be reasonable to take the phone,” Rosenbaum says.

These rights apply to everyone, in any place where a raid occurs, Rosenbaum says.

Whether authorities follow the law is another question altogether.

ICE arrests others too — and starts deportation efforts

ICE has arrested U.S. citizens who say they were not bystanders filming a raid — they just happened to be in the area — and processed them as if they were undocumented immigrants.

On June 24, agents tackled Andrea Velez, a marketing designer, to the ground as she walked to work in Los Angeles. “They were just telling me that I was being arrested for interfering or resisting arrest,” Velez told reporters. “I don’t think I was. I was just resisting because I didn’t know where I was going to end up or who was taking me,” she said.

She was held in immigration detention for over 24 hours before her citizenship was confirmed to authorities. She says she repeatedly told the ICE agents that she was a citizen, but they doubted her claims. ICE originally charged Velez with assault, but the Department of Justice dropped the charges.

On July 10, ICE agents dragged a U.S. army veteran, George Retes, out of his car at gunpoint and held him for three days in immigration detention, without the opportunity to change clothes, call his family or meet with a lawyer. Retes worked as a security guard at a farm in Camarillo, where ICE agents arrested dozens of undocumented workers. “What happened to me wasn’t just a mistake — it was a violation of my civil rights,” Retes wrote in a statement.

In July, Rosenbaum was part of a group that successfully argued for a temporary restraining order to stop raids in seven Southern California counties due to racial profiling on the part of ICE agents. In a news conference, Secretary Noem called the judge in the case “an idiot” and said: “None of our operations are going to change.”

Even before the current Trump administration’s deportation push, federal auditors found that immigration systems make it possible to deport citizens erroneously. The climate of aggressive enforcement may be enough to make some citizens unsure how they’ll prove their legal status if they encounter ICE.

Rosenbaum says that while people shouldn’t have to carry a passport, anyone concerned about being profiled could consider carrying a photocopy to ease their worries.

More importantly, he says, people whose rights have been violated should file legal complaints in their cases. Arrests motivated by racial bias are not mistakes on the part of ICE, Rosenbaum says, but illegal acts. “The government isn’t supposed to accidentally do anything,” he says.

Even though the government has now acknowledged that it is not heeding all court orders, Rosenbaum says anyone who is the victim of an illegal arrest or detention should seek relief through the legal system, in an attempt to hold law enforcement accountable. There are numerous pro bono civil rights law groups operating in Southern California to avoid legal fees.

“When law enforcement is out of control, as it is right now, it’s not unreasonable to be worried, but you’re better protected by understanding your legal rights than you are by avoiding it for fear of reprisals,” Rosenbaum says. “Your security and the security of the nation depends on you.”

Arrests have lingering effects

Barbara Stone was held in the same room for eight hours. Despite asking for a lawyer “about 15 times,” she says, she was not permitted to talk to one. She was not under arrest, but she was also not allowed to leave.

Rosenbaum called these actions “unconstitutional” and “egregious.”

Then, without issuing charges, the officers released her.

Stone says while she was in custody, she imagined what that same situation would feel like for one of the immigrants she saw arrested outside the courtroom.

“I’m not a victim,” she says, noting how she knew even in the worst case scenario, she would be shielded by systems that would not protect deportees. “I just cannot believe seeing these defenseless people being dragged away in the elevator,” she says. “How can we ever get used to this?”

At first, she thought she would return to immigration court to observe ICE. Now, she has decided to express her support in other ways. She is not afraid of ICE, she says, but does not want to be the center of attention.

Arrests of bystanders have changed the way other activists interact with agents too. The group Stone was with still observes in court, but gives the agents a wider berth when they arrest immigrants.

“I see them with their masks on and I want to say something, but I know that I can’t do that, so I stay silent and I just try to look them in the eye,” says Gretchen Bitterlin, an observer at the San Diego immigration court who volunteers with a different interfaith coalition.

She says she “won’t take the chance” to film the ICE raids she witnesses.

Since returning home, Stone says, the bruises from the agents grabbing her and the scrapes from the handcuffs have faded, but that did not signal the end of the ordeal. After her case was broadcast on national news, Stone’s husband received an anonymous phone call with an AI-modified voice, threatening the couple. They have since decided to add extra security lights to their home. Stone says she is plagued by recurring nightmares, in which people break into her home and she cannot escape.

When agents released Stone at the courthouse after her eight-hour detention, they returned her purse, but not the phone she had used to record video that day. The phone was “a weapon,” they told her. Nearly two months later, she still has not gotten it back.

Abrego was released Friday from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee, where he had been held since his return to the U.S. in June after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

Immigration authorities were expected to attempt to deport Abrego upon his release. Abrego “may be removed to Uganda no less than 72 hours absent weekends,” a source familiar with the case told NBC News on Saturday.

That is in line with standard procedure that ICE must give immigrants 72 hours notice before removing them to third countries.

Abrego, originally from El Salvador, had a withholding of removal order from 2019 that prevents his deportation to his home country due to concerns that he would be persecuted by violent gangs.

The removal order was violated when the Trump administration accidentally deported Abrego to the El Salvador’s CECOT prison, notorious for its harsh conditions, in March. However, the 2019 protective order does not bar Abrego from being deported to another country.

Abrego’s lawyers have now notified the judge in the Middle District of Tennessee that ICE has informed Abrego of its intent to deport him to Uganda. Abrego could not face the criminal charges of human smuggling brought against him by DOJ in that case if he is out of the country.

Abrego, a father of three, was reunited with his family on Friday after spending nearly half a year away from home. Images of the reunification, released by advocates, show a teary-eyed Abrego holding his youngest son, who was with his father when Abrego was picked up by immigration authorities in March.

“Today has been a very special day because I have seen my family for the first time in more than 160 days,” he said in a statement on Friday.

“I’d like to thank all the people who have supported me because after this long time I have witnessed that so many people have been by my side with such positivity,” he added. “Today I am grateful to God because He has heard me and today I am out. We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served.”

Immediately upon his return to the United States in June, Abrego was charged with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.

“Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center.
“It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system.","FORT MYERS, Fla.— Immigrants’ rights advocates filed a federal lawsuit Friday evening challenging Florida’s authority to detain people at the notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a hastily constructed facility in the middle of the Everglades, which is surrounded by alligators, snakes, mosquitos, and swampland at risk of dangerous flooding. The case focuses on the state’s expansive and unlawful use of 287(g) agreements to assert independent state control over immigration detainees, which is still at issue after yesterday’s court ruling ending transfers of people to the facility.

The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court.

The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of people detained at the Everglades facility.

The 287(g) program allows individual state and local officers to help with a narrow set of immigration enforcement tasks, subject to rigorous training and close supervision by federal officials. It does not allow them to set up their own independent detention operations. And it does not let state officers sub-delegate immigration authority to private contractors who do not and cannot participate in the 287(g) program. Florida officers are also acting without adequate training in the many complex facets of immigration law. Many are only spending a few hours online, compared to equivalent federal officers who receive multiple weeks of in person training.

These unprecedented violations of the 287(g) statute have immediately led to a host of real-world problems. Physical conditions at the facility are atrocious and dangerous. Detainees are going “off the grid” and being taken out of the normal systems for immigration detention and removal proceedings. Congress required the Department of Homeland Security to maintain custody of immigration detainees, and it imposed tight limits on the 287(g) program, precisely to avoid these kinds of problems.

“This facility has already become a disaster in the first few weeks of its operations, with mounting reports of disease, wrongful removals, and people being denied all kinds of basic rights. This is exactly why Congress did not allow states to set up their own immigration facilities. The government needs to follow the law when people’s lives and liberties are at stake. It’s time for this failed experiment to end,” said Spencer Amdur, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel.

“Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center. Not only have the conditions been abhorrent, but the detention itself is unlawful. People are being held without charge, cut off from their attorneys, and made invisible in the immigration system. Families cannot even find out where their loved ones are. This is a crisis created entirely by the state’s reckless decision to ignore federal law and invent its own immigration jail in the middle of the Everglades. The harm being inflicted on our clients is immediate and irreparable, and it underscores why states are not allowed to overstep into federal immigration processes,” said Amy Godshall, legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney with the ACLU of Florida.

“Our immigrant communities have always been right about this: We are Floridians, too, and deserve the same respect, compassion and due process as anyone else in this state. Florida’s authoritarian experiment cannot continue unchecked, and we are confident the court will see that there is no lawful authority for Florida to operate this immigration facility,” said Miriam Haskell, senior attorney and director of litigation at Community Justice Project.

“It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system. The lack of accountability and resulting deprivation at this remote and inhumane detention camp in the Florida Everglades is exactly why Congress has made it unlawful and directed only the federal government to have custody over noncitizens as they go through the immigration system,” said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center.

The DOJ’s Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO) has issued four decisions over the past year regarding alleged violations of U.S. immigration law.

The decisions concern the valuation of I-9 penalties, subpoena disputes, and the calculation of interest on penalties.

From May 2024 through June 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO)—which is responsible for adjudicating violations of Form I-9, unlawful employment of unauthorized workers, and unfair immigration-related employment practices—has issued only four decisions. Of the four, two decisions concerned the valuation of I-9 penalties, one concerned subpoena disputes, and the final decision addressed calculation of interest on penalties. This year’s summary once again highlights the downward trend in published substantive OCAHO decisions.1 This continued trend appears to be caused by the introduction of a Settlement Officer Program, which has assisted litigants to reach a resolution of a case without further litigation.

OCAHO Continues to Decline to Use ICE’s Matrix

As can be seen in prior Littler articles,2 OCAHO has consistently declined to follow the matrix (a tool that determines the amount of the penalty per the percentage of I-9 violations found in the audit) used by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is based upon the percentage of Forms I-9 with substantive errors.

In United States v. John Ferguson Moving & Storage, 21 OCAHO no. 1651 (Mar. 12, 2025), Respondent failed to prepare any Forms I-9 for its 23 employees; thus, it did not provide any in response to ICE’s Notice of Inspection (NOI). ICE calculated a civil monetary penalty of $45,586 for failure to prepare and/or present 23 Forms I-9. It used $1,982 per I-9 violation, which ICE stated was the highest amount permissible.

Respondent asserted it provided 16 Forms I-9, but they were completed after service of the NOI; thus, they were not considered in the decision-making. It also raised an affirmative defense of good faith. However, good faith is only reviewed for technical errors, hiring employees, and as a statutory factor; thus, it is misplaced as a defense to a substantive violation.

Since ICE used the highest assessment of penalties allowed at that time, it did not use the five mitigating/aggravating factors.3 However, OCAHO did consider the factors and found Respondent was a small employer, which provides for a 5% mitigating factor. Concerning seriousness of the violations, OCAHO found this was a 5% aggravating factor. The other three factors, good faith/bad faith, no employment of unauthorized workers and no history of violations, were determined to be neutral.

OCAHO concluded that it was going to exercise its discretion and find a reduction in the proposed penalty amount that was just and reasonable. Here, OCAHO held:

[The government] proposes a penalty of $1,982 per violation, which is approximately 71% of the maximum of the penalty range the court can consider for these violations.4 Penalties at or near the maximum permissible fine amount should be reserved for more egregious circumstances. Here, the court weighs most heavily the seriousness of the violations for failure to prepare and/or present Forms I-9 and considers that the violations include all of Respondent’s employees…. After considering the remaining statutory factors, the court finds that the violations do not warrant a penalty toward the high end of the penalty range. Rather, the court exercises its de novo authority and finds that a penalty slightly above the mid-range is warranted.

Thus, the ALJ reduced the penalties from ICE’s proposed $45,586 to $36,179.

In United States v. Pasquel Hermanos, Inc., 18 OCAHO no. 1506f (May 27, 2025), Respondent was charged with failure to prepare and/or present Forms I-9 for 22 of the 23 employees. In its defense, Respondent asserted all its employees were authorized to be employed; therefore, there were no substantiative violations. OCAHO summarily dismissed that defense. In reviewing the penalties, OCAHO stated, “The civil penalties for violations of Section 1324s are intended to set a meaningful fine to promote the future compliance.”

OCAHO determined the penalties by reviewing the five statutory aggravating/mitigating factors. In so doing, OCAHO found the employer’s small size was a mitigating factor. Concerning whether there was bad faith, OCAHO stated:

[T]his employer had a poor compliance rate - demonstrating it took virtually no steps to comply with the law before the inspection. However, there is nothing to indicate that during the inspection and in the time preceding the receipt of the Notice of Intent to Fine this employer engaged in any concerning behavior; rather, the record shows the employer was forthcoming about the number of Forms I-9 available for inspection, and seemed otherwise comply expeditiously with the HSI auditors request. Without more, the statutory factor is duly considered, but it does not serve, in this case, to aggravate or mitigate the penalty.

The seriousness factor was met and determined to be an aggravating factor. The final two factors, no employment of unauthorized workers and no history of violations, were found to be neutral.

OCAHO decided to use a mid-range of penalties, not the matrix, in assessing $1,450 per violation for a total of $31,900, rather than ICE’s proposed penalties of $42,856.

On average, OCAHO reduced the penalties by 23% in these two published decisions.

Subpoena Disputes

A subpoena dispute arose in In re Investigation of Adobe, Inc., 21 OCAHO no. 1669 (June 25, 2025). During an investigation of a charge by Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) of the Department of Justice, IER issued a subpoena requesting from Abode information concerning applicants for positions that Charging Party applied, including PERM applicants, information about Charging Party, and personnel files for applicants.

Adobe raised two principal objections. First, IER exceeded its statutory authority in continuing an investigation when there was no reasonable cause for the charge. In response, OCAHO concluded, “A determination on whether IER has conducted a sufficient investigation is beyond this ALJ's authority; nor would this ALJ be aware of whether IER has expanded the scope of the investigation, which has the authority to do.... Further, a resolution of the merits of the case is outside the scope of these proceedings and would be improper in any event without a full evidentiary submission.”

Second, Abode asserts attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege on presenting many documents. However, Adobe failed to present a privilege log under Rule 25(b)(5). As OCAHO stated:

A properly crafted privilege log has the potential to resolve disputes without Court intervention in that it helps the opposing side evaluate whether it should challenge the asserted privileges. When Court intervention is required, that same privilege log allows the court to understand the propriety of the party’s position on privileges. In this case the Court has no basis upon which to resolve the dispute as there is no privilege law and thus no way for the court to evaluate whether it was properly asserted.

The Court orders Petitioner (Adobe) to create a privilege log for any responsive documents it intends to withhold based on a privilege…. [T]he Court asks IER to review the privileged log, meet and confer with the Petitioner, and if any asserted privilege cannot be resolved, the parties may then bring the dispute to this Court to resolve with an in camera review of the withheld documents.

Calculation of Interest on Penalties

In United States v. Majestic Petroleum Services, LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1641b (April 3, 2025), the parties, ICE and Respondent, reached a settlement agreement for an installment payment plan. Thereafter, a dispute arose on the amount of monthly payment based on calculation of monthly interest. The pertinent language is as follows:

It is financially unable to pay the amount due in one lump sum payment, Respondent will pay its $95,000 debt in 108-monthly installments and also agrees to pay interest on the outstanding balance. Each monthly billing set by the FSCB will be for an amount which represents an amount of principal plus the interest….

The interest due will be amortized over the 108-month payment period and will be added to the principal amount due each month.

Respondent asserts that the agreement’s terms, “fixed” and “amortized over the 108-month payment period” with respect to the rate and payment of interest mean that it should have a fixed monthly payment including principal and interest.

OCAHO disagreed with Respondent’s interpretation and stated, “The phrase ‘monthly installments’ is only used in reference to the payment of the principal, separate from the distinct agreement to pay interest on the outstanding balance…. Were this provision to state that both debt and interest on it would be paid in monthly installments, such language would support Respondent’s interpretation that both the principal and interest payment would be one fixed monthly payment; however, such is not the case here.”

Conclusion

There is a continuing trend of OCAHO decreasing the penalties between 23% and 40%. Therefore, it is often beneficial to litigate before OCAHO, rather than accept ICE’s proposed penalties. Alternatively, after a Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF) is filed but before a Complaint is issued, employers should consider using the possibility of litigation before OCAHO to negotiate lower penalties with ICE.

The other two cited OCAHO decisions help employers to understand the subpoena process as well as calculation of interest in settlements.

Employers seeking more information on trends in I-9 compliance can contact immigration counsel.

The president suggested he wanted to improve the city’s rusting light poles, repave its streets and make other beautification efforts. He has previously complained about the appearance of the grass in some of the city’s parks.

“And we’re going to have this place beautified within a period of 12 months,” Trump said.

Asked later Friday how he would come up with the money, Trump said he had already spoken to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and that it would not be a significant amount.

The Trump administration earlier this month began surging federal law enforcement across parts of the District to crack down on what the White House said was an unacceptable level of crime, though statistics show violent crime has declined in the city this year.

Last week, Trump took federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department and deployed hundreds of National Guard troops across the city to further the crackdown on crime. Trump has the authority to do those things because of home rule laws that govern the District of Columbia.

Uganda’s agreement to accept US deportees is a multifaceted development wrapped in both opportunity and challenge.","In August 2025, Uganda announced a ""temporary"" agreement with the United States to accept deportees under a “third-country” deportation policy—a plan where migrants who do not qualify for asylum in the US but are unwilling or unable to return to their home countries are sent to a third nation. This development has sparked intense debate involving government officials, human rights groups, and local communities in Uganda, as the country already hosts one of the largest refugee populations in Africa. This analysis dissects what Uganda stands to gain and face from accepting these deportees, the intricacies of the deal, and the diverse statements from involved stakeholders.

The Nature of the Agreement and Its Scope

The agreement between Uganda and the United States is tailored for migrants deported from the US who do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors. The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that

“the two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented""

but the agreement is understood to be ""concluded"". The targets of this repatriation program primarily include Africans and Asians who sought asylum at the US-Mexico border but did not qualify for refugee status. Uganda has explicitly expressed preference for migrants who are African nationals.

However, some ambiguity remains as to the exact number of deportees Uganda will accept. While the US has deported small numbers to other African countries like Eswatini and South Sudan, Uganda’s eventual intake remains unspecified. The agreement strictly excludes those with criminal histories, a point Uganda underscores to assure the public that the country is not accepting ""illegal aliens.""

Uganda’s Refugee Context and Capacity Challenges

Uganda is renowned for its refugee-friendly immigration policy and currently hosts between 1.7 to 1.8 million refugees—mostly from neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan. This substantial existing population of refugees already places considerable demand on Uganda’s resources, health services, and social infrastructure.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda’s State Minister for Foreign Affairs, has voiced the country’s concerns candidly:

“We do not have the capacity to accommodate such foreign deportees from the United States in Uganda”.

He further questioned the wisdom of taking in people whom their own countries have rejected, stating,

“We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?”.

This position illustrates Uganda’s cautious stance, emphasizing that while Uganda’s refugee policy is benevolent, practical limits must be recognized.

The government is actively negotiating related issues such as visas, tariffs, and sanctions to ensure deportations do not unfairly burden host communities. These concerns reflect broader anxieties within Uganda about the economic and social impact of potentially inflating the population of non-citizens who might strain public services and job markets.

Statements from Stakeholders

The Ugandan government’s communications reflect a dual narrative. On one side, officials confirm a legal, structured agreement exists or is being finalized to accept deportees. Uganda’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, through Permanent Secretary Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, explained the deal applies only to migrants rejected for asylum in the US but reluctant to return home. However, other officials, including Henry Okello Oryem, have publicly denied any finalized deal or capacity to accept deportees, highlighting an internal tension or messaging strategy possibly designed to manage public opinion amid criticism.

From the US side, this policy forms part of a broader strategy initiated under former President Donald Trump, aiming to rigorously enforce immigration laws and reduce illegal immigration by deporting millions, including by using third countries to take individuals who cannot be returned directly to their origin countries. U.S. officials describe third-country deportations as necessary for migrants lacking citizenship but remaining in the US illegally, as diplomatic or political obstacles bar simple repatriation.

Human rights organizations have strongly criticized this approach, warning deportees face risks in countries with less regulatory oversight or hostile environments. They argue these deportations may violate international law and expose migrants to harm, especially given the limited transparency and safeguards in some host countries.

What Will Uganda Gain?

Several analysts propose that Uganda’s acceptance of US deportees may be motivated by geopolitical and economic considerations beyond humanitarian logic. There is speculation that Uganda is positioning itself to gain favor with the US administration to unlock better trade deals and attract foreign investment, potentially leveraging the agreement as a diplomatic bargaining chip.

Accepting deportees can also be viewed as Uganda demonstrating cooperation with global powers on immigration and security matters, which could enhance its international standing. Furthermore, Uganda might negotiate financial or infrastructural support from the US and other donors to offset the costs of integrating or housing deportees.

While these potential gains exist, they must be weighed against the significant social and economic risks linked to adding to an already large refugee population with limited resources. This includes possible strain on Uganda’s infrastructure, public services, and labor market competition.

Complexities and Ethical Dilemmas

Uganda's position reveals a tension between international cooperation and national interests. The government’s explicit rejection of criminal deportees and unaccompanied minors reflects efforts to manage social risks and public perceptions. Local Ugandans express wariness about the impact of more migrants on their resources, fearing inadequate support or social friction.

Moreover, Uganda's acceptance of deportees from various African nations raises ethical questions about the accountability of home countries rejecting their nationals and the fairness of placing the burden on third countries. This approach risks outsourcing immigration challenges without addressing root causes like poverty, conflict, and instability in migrants’ countries of origin.

Uganda’s agreement to accept US deportees is a multifaceted development wrapped in both opportunity and challenge. The nation stands to potentially benefit through improved bilateral relations with the US and possible economic incentives but faces substantial social, economic, and ethical dilemmas. The agreement’s ""temporary"" and conditional nature, excluding criminals and unaccompanied minors, seeks to balance Uganda’s humanitarian commitments with practical limits.

Ugandan officials have articulated concerns about capacity and community integration, signaling caution despite public statements confirming the deal. Meanwhile, international human rights groups continue to scrutinize the policy’s implications for migrant safety and legal integrity.",https://impactpolicies.org/admin/storage/photos/shares/2025/Uganda-Accepting-US-Deportees-Gains-Challenges-and-Stakeholder-Perspectives.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:39.788132

Officials said the arrests followed two shootings connected to the business in the prior two months.

At least one person arrested, Marlen Ortiz Soto, was not at the restaurant and was apprehended while searching for gas.

At least one of the nearly three dozen people arrested in Fairfield for allegedly breaking immigration law had no connection to the Peruvian restaurant at the center of the arrests.

Marlen Ortiz Soto, 24, and her boyfriend were in search of gas, traveling back to her Hamilton home, when they were stopped by Fairfield police and arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Aug. 17, according to her attorney, Krishna Mahadevan.

They had not been at the Sabor Peruano restaurant and nightclub on Ohio State Route 4, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati, where local and federal officials arrested 34 people they said were in the United States illegally.

“They had nothing to do with this restaurant,” Mahadevan told The Enquirer on Aug. 22, the day after the Fairfield Police Department announced the arrests. “They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Now Ortiz Soto is detained at the Butler County Jail and her boyfriend, Daniel Flores, is charged with obstruction of official business.

Shootings prompted arrests, officials said

ICE and local officials ""conducted an operation in and around the Sabor Peruano Night Club” in response to recent violence there, Fairfield police said in an Aug. 21 press release.

In the prior two months, two shootings were linked to the business, the press release said, and “investigations revealed that many of the individuals involved were in the country illegally.”

Those circumstances led officials to the restaurant Aug. 16, where they made the arrests and and then transported the individuals to the Butler County Jail.

Fairfield police did not disclose the exact location of the arrests, the charges against those arrested or details about the shootings. They did not respond to a request for additional information Aug. 22.

Business owner: 'I don't know what's going on'

Sabor Peruano is located at the end of a strip mall that used to be anchored by a Van Leunens department store and is now dominated by the Ohio Valley Antique Mall.

At midday Aug. 22, the restaurant was open, but the parking lot was mostly empty. At the back of the establishment, another entrance is marked with a sign for Rumba Bar. State business records indicate the ownership of the two businesses overlap.

Employees at Sabor Peruano – ""Peruvian flavor"" in English − said the manager was not on site and they were not authorized to speak about what happened.

Owner Mary Ticacala picked up the phone earlier in the day.

“Police haven’t been in the building,” she said when asked about the arrests. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

She declined to answer additional questions, saying she was busy with her lunch business.

Workers at the other businesses in the strip, which includes an African grocery and leatherworking shop, said they hadn't noticed anything unusual about Sabor Peruano. However, nearly all of the other nearby businesses are closed in the evenings.

Sabor Peruano has operated at 7245 Dixie Highway since 2015, in business from a site about a half-mile away the prior eight years. The business moved after its original home was destroyed in a November 2014 fire.

The business Facebook page is dominated by promotions for its music and dancing, starting at 9 p.m. The restaurant, where traditional Peruvian entrées are priced at $16-$18, closes at 9.

Mostly men arrested over 24-hour period

Officials arrested mostly men, ranging in age from about 20 to 40, during the Aug. 16 sweep in Fairfield.

They were picked up over about 24 hours, from about 8 p.m. Aug. 16 to 8 p.m. Aug. 17, according to records from the Butler County Jail.

Around the same time, the Butler County Sheriff’s Office took five more people into custody during a separate traffic enforcement operation. The five “were identified as being in the United States illegally,” Sheriff Richard Jones said in a news release.

Eight of the total 39 no longer appeared on the jail’s roster as of Aug. 22.

Of the still-detained individuals, just two are women. One is Mahadevan’s client, Marlen Jamileth Ortiz Soto.

Woman still 'confused about why she was detained'

Ortiz Soto, a Honduran, came to the United States in January 2019, her attorney said. She lives in Hamilton with her mother and siblings.

Her mother applied for asylum status for herself and her children in 2020, with another hearing in her case before the Cleveland Immigration Court scheduled next month, Mahadevan said.

Ortiz Soto has a valid work permit and operates a cleaning business, the attorney said. She and Flores, a U.S. citizen, are considering getting married, he said.

She remains in good spirits in detention, he said.

“Obviously, she is still a little confused about why she was detained,” he said. “She asked the ICE officers who detained her ... and was never given a reason.”

He has filed a bond request for her release, but said the immigration court won’t likely take that up until early next month.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/22/PCIN/85781445007-img-5781.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-23 10:57:01.390455

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email.

Why It Matters

Cases such as those involving Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was arrested over involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, have drawn scrutiny toward the Trump administration's immigration policy. Legal experts have sounded the alarms that green card holders are being targeted for deportation over reasons connected to their speech.

This could have implications for more than 10 million green card holders living in the United States.

What to Know

Khalil's case is perhaps the most prominent that has led to questions about green card holders' free speech rights, protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He was detained in March after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged he was a national security threat, which he has denied.

Other cases that have raised these concerns include that of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student who was arrested after she penned an opinion piece criticizing the university's approach to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, or Yunseo Chung, another Columbia student arrested after participating in pro-Palestinian protests.

The administration has argued that these detainments and deportations are necessary to protect the national security interests of the U.S. But critics say those two individuals have not demonstrated any threats to national security and that their arrests are tied to constitutionally protected speech that the Trump administration does not agree with.

Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), is among those filing legal challenges against the administration for allegedly moving to deport people for their protected speech.

""This isn't theoretical right now to green card holders,"" he said. ""This is an active threat to their freedom of speech.""

Fitzpatrick said the idea that individual graduate students are ""somehow imperiling"" national security or foreign policy is ""absurd.""

""They're just airing opinions,"" he said. ""That means that they're airing views that Americans can air without fear. And so at the point that you're punishing someone for voicing an opinion that more than 300 million other people in the United States would be able to air and there wouldn't be a problem, it really shows that this is about the ideas that they voice rather than any sort of serious security concern.""

In a court filing, FIRE accused Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio of ""trying to turn the inalienable human right of free speech into a privilege contingent upon the whims of a federal bureaucrat, triggering deportation proceedings against noncitizens residing lawfully in this country for their protected political speech regarding American and Israeli foreign policy.""

Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia University, in an interview with Newsweek cast doubt on that justification, noting that green-card holders like Khalil or Chung do not have criminal records.

The First Amendment ""protects all people on U.S. soil, regardless of their citizenship status,"" and that has been affirmed in Supreme Court cases ""over decades,"" she said.

Many of the immigrants and green card holders targeted so far have been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, but there are concerns the administration could use the foreign policy justification to target others as well, Mukherjee said, describing it as a ""slippery slope.""

""While today, the secretary of state may be invoking the foreign policy deportability ground against those who are speaking out in favor of Palestinian rights, tomorrow, next week, next month, the secretary of state could invoke that same ground, the foreign-policy-deportability ground to target economists who don't believe in tariffs on countries that have been levied by the administration or could use the foreign policy deportability ground to target climate scientists who are outspoken about the Trump administration's destruction of climate policies,"" she said.

The foreign policy deportation ground has historically been used in cases involving individuals convicted of serious crimes elsewhere in the world such as terrorism—not cases involving people attending protests or writing articles about U.S. foreign policy.

""Those cases are worlds apart from what we are seeing today,"" she said.

Many green card holders living in the United States are asking questions about how they should navigate the difficult situation. Mukherjee is providing counsel to some of these individuals who have asked questions about whether they should refrain from participating in protests or sharing their views on social media.

""Unfortunately, I am urging people to proceed with caution given this administration's disregard for the protections that should be offered to all people on U.S. soil under the First Amendment,"" she said.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services this week announced in August that immigration officers have been ordered to apply a more holistic assessment of ""good moral character"" when deciding on naturalization applications—this has fueled concerns about what this may mean for some green card holders.

Gautam Hans, director of Cornell Law School's Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Clinic, told Newsweek the State Department generally has ""extensive leeway"" over questions of deportations.

""The First Amendment arguments are very persuasive, but the courts also often defer to State on issues of immigration,"" he said.

He warned that the administration may be using deportations against pro-Palestinian activists as a ""trial balloon for more draconian measures.""

Former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg told Newsweek the change ""would appear to give immigration officers discretion to evaluate social media posts, or even subscriptions to certain podcasts, as grounds for deportation.""

USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser previously told Newsweek the new process ""ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.""

""This memo ensures that USCIS officers are accounting for an alien's positive contributions to American society—including community involvement, achievements, and financial responsibility rather than the absence of their misconduct. USCIS will continue to restore integrity in the nation's immigration system—especially when it comes to the prestigious privilege of citizenship,"" he said.

Rubio, however, has said the case involving Khalil is not about free speech.

""This is not about free speech. This is about people that don't have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card, by the way,"" he told reporters in March.

He continued, ""So when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down and being complicit in what are clearly crimes of vandalization, complicit in shutting down learning institutions – there are kids at these schools that can't go to class.""

What People Are Saying

Former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg told Newsweek: ""While the First Amendment absolutely should provide protection for any green card holder, the administration has shown, repeatedly, that they do not care about, and will not respect, these constitutional protections,"" he said. ""While a judge may very well, ultimately, rule in favor of the green card holder, in the meantime he/she could be detained in a detention camp in a Florida swamp. At that point, many green card holders may choose to voluntarily self-deport.""

The Department of Homeland Security wrote in an X post this week: ""If you hate America, you have no business demanding to live in America.""

What Happens Next

Trump's immigration policies continue to face legal challenges. Hans said some of the cases involving deportations and the First Amendment are likely to eventually make it to the Supreme Court.

Hawaii, I am not optimistic that the Court will do the right thing as a matter of law and protect immigrants and non-citizens,"" he said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708348/mahmoud-khalil-protests-free-speech.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:49.492453

In addition to the new rules regarding truckers, the Trump administration also announced Thursday an expanded review process for as many as 55 million other immigrants, too.

The State Department says it will now have a continuous vetting process for all valid U.S. visa holders.

So what do these new policies actually mean for people who are here on visas?

Some states, however, have sought to restrict recording of law enforcement by passing buffer zone laws that mandate bystanders keep a certain distance from police activity. Some of those laws face court challenges on First Amendment grounds.

Even apart from that issue, recording an ICE encounter is not without risk.

“I understand that some bystanders might feel less able to intervene,” said Austin Rose, managing attorney at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “And the reality is that you’re not going to prevent (the arrest) from happening in the vast majority of situations.”

“There are real risks,” he added. “I think filming is really helpful … it’s important that people know what’s going on.”

Q. Can anyone warn someone about ICE?

Noem has suggested apps that crowdsource ICE activity or flag ICE sightings could interfere with federal law enforcement – and threatened to punish users.

“This sure looks like obstruction of justice,” the secretary wrote in a June social media post. “If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

But any effort to prosecute someone for warning of a potential arrest would run afoul of a considerable body of legal precedent that holds alerting people of a possible arrest is First Amendment-protected speech.

Q. What questions can witnesses ask as someone is being detained?

If someone sees an ICE arrest, it could be useful to learn a detainee’s biographical information – name, date of birth and country of origin – if the witness wants to keep up with the case using public databases or help someone like a reporter, lawyer or relative do so, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center.

“Try and get someone’s name.” he suggested. “Try and say, ‘Is there somebody you want me to call?’”

Still, “sometimes there’s not a chance to do that,” Luken said, warning that bystanders should also assess their own risk – especially if they are undocumented – and adding that no one has the right to directly interfere with an ICE operation.

Bystanders can try to ask ICE agents questions as long as they’re not interfering, Rose said. But, he added, they’re under no obligation to respond.

“ICE is likely not to answer your questions,” he said, “but I think an important thing to ask about is (whether they have) a warrant.”

Q. How serious an offense is it to be undocumented in the United States?

The Trump administration has made clear it views being an undocumented immigrant in the United States as a crime.

“We’re going to enforce the immigration law,” border czar Tom Homan told CNN’s Dana Bash last month. “It’s not OK to be in this country illegally. It’s not OK to enter this country illegally. It’s a crime.”

But when it comes to how immigration arrests are conducted – and what rights a detained person has – the legal basis for the arrest matters, immigrant rights and legal experts told CNN.

It’s important to understand that crossing the border and being undocumented in the United States generally is a civil infraction, not a criminal offense, Lukens said.

This distinction sets the tone for how ICE agents interact with the people they’ve apprehended, he said.

For instance, agents “do not have to Mirandize someone because it’s not a criminal arrest,” Lukens said, referring to the practice of informing someone of their legal rights once they’re in custody.

The civil offense also affects the type of judge who will hear the case, whether an arrestee is entitled to legal representation and how quickly the Department of Homeland Security can remove someone from the United States. (More on that later.)

Notably, re-entering the United States after being deported is a felony, and a conviction could result in a fine and up to two years in prison, the US Criminal Code states. Those penalties increase if the person is also charged with a drug-related or other criminal offense, which could land someone found guilty up to 20 years in prison.

Q. What are an immigrant’s rights during an ICE encounter?

No matter their legal status, everyone is entitled to protection from unreasonable search and seizure and excessive use of force under the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, said Jenn Borchetta, deputy director of the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project.

“There needs to be a reasonable basis to believe the person they’re stopping is either in the country illegally or otherwise is committing some kind of immigration violation,” she told CNN.

Meanwhile, “the unnecessarily aggressive conduct we’ve seen from immigration agents is really an escalation and outgrowth of police tactics that are usually confined only to certain neighborhoods,” Borchetta said.

For example, footage of CBP agents opening fire on and smashing the windows of a family’s truck in San Bernadino, California, during a targeted immigration enforcement operation this week has drawn criticism from activists and immigration attorneys. The officers acted in self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

Constitutional protections “only exist if they apply to everyone,” Borchetta said. “If federal agents don’t need reasonable suspicion to detain people, they can go out and stop anybody on the street. That means they can stop citizens.”

“Every ICE officer goes through Fourth Amendment training every six months and (is) reminded what their authorities are for arrest, detention and questioning so the officers (are) very well-trained,” Homan told CNN.

Q. How does ICE typically identify someone agents are going to question or detain?

ICE is “conducting intelligence-based, targeted enforcement operations,” an agency spokesperson told CNN in a recent statement.

Under past White House administrations, ICE would apprehend someone if they were aware the person had committed a crime or were caught at the border or because a judge granted a warrant for their removal, Lukens told CNN.

While apprehending such a person, he added, it was “not odd for (ICE agents) to also walk down the hallway of the apartment building and say, ‘Do you have your status? Do you have your papers?’”

Anyone who said no could also be detained, Lukens said.

Under the second Trump administration, however, ICE tactics have gotten more aggressive, with workplace raids – like those this summer at Los Angeles-area farms and Home Depot sites – becoming increasingly common, he said.

Trump’s border czar defended the agency’s tactics after a judge blocked the administration from conducting immigration stops and arrests in Southern California over concerns agents were engaging in profiling and lacked probable cause.

“(ICE agents) don’t need probable cause to briefly detain and question someone, they just need ‘reasonable suspicion,’” Homan told CNN last month. “Physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody … It’s a myriad of factors. Every situation is different.”

After Homan vowed to “litigate” the order, a federal appeals court upheld the halting of immigration sweeps.

Q. Does someone have to show ID or answer questions during an ICE encounter?

While state laws require a motorist stopped by police to show a driver’s license upon request, there is otherwise no legal obligation to carry and show an ID – including citizenship papers or a passport – to law enforcement upon request, Rose said.

“You’re under no constitutional obligation to give your name or to give any papers,” he said. “The problem, though, is that you don’t feel you’re free to leave in this situation. And so, I think people understandably try to comply.”

However, the onus changes once someone is in custody or has been arrested, he added.

“Once you’re arrested, you arguably have to provide ID and information, and so timing there can kind of matter and be a little tricky.”

Over the years, Rose has seen “a difference between what the law is and should be, and what the reality is,” he said.

“In general, the law is that noncitizens do have the same constitutional rights with respect to the due process clause (of the Fifth Amendment) and other provisions of the Constitution, as citizens,” he said. “But the practical reality is often different.”

Q. Do immigrants have a right to an attorney?

Because being undocumented is often a civil infraction, immigrants are not automatically provided an attorney as they would be in a criminal case, Borchetta said: “Unfortunately, access to counsel can be a problem. Your access to the outside isn’t as protected as in a criminal context.”

However, some states, like New York, are working to pass laws requiring those who are facing deportation to have access to an attorney. “That’s why you see people getting detained in New York and sent to Louisiana,” Borchetta said.

Attorneys and immigration rights advocates often offer legal services to those in detention, but such organizations are struggling to keep up with the “firehose” of demand, Lukens said.

Further complicating matters, the Department of Homeland Security takes the position it does not have to let attorneys into detention centers, though that stance is contested.

“We’re not in the jails as much as we used to be because they don’t have to let us in,” Lukens said. “So, it’s harder to do the work.”

Q. ICE agents have been wearing masks and driving unmarked cars. Do they have to identify themselves?

Citing concerns over online doxxing and officers’ safety, many ICE agents have begun wearing balaclavas and neck gaiters to cover their faces while conducting immigration sweeps. ICE did not immediately respond to CNN’s questions about its mask policy and whether and how agents should identify themselves.

For now, there is no legal requirement for federal agents to identify themselves, experts told CNN.

“At the same time, it puts both agents and the public at risk if they don’t,” Borchetta said. “If someone is legitimately confused about who is detaining them, then that could cause the person to legitimately respond with force or other reactions that escalate a situation and put everyone at risk.”

Q. How can a loved one or lawyer find someone they believe has been detained over an immigration issue?

Locating someone who’s been apprehended over an immigration issue can be incredibly difficult. The Department of Homeland Security and its agents are not obligated to answer questions from family members, journalists or citizens, experts told CNN.

There are publicly available databases – such as the online detainee locator – where anyone can search for people held in ICE facilities, Rose said.

“All noncitizens, if they’ve had any contact with the immigration system – whether that’s border patrol or ICE – will have a nine-digit ‘A-number,’” he said. “You can use that to find out where they’re detained.”

An A-number can also be used to look up the basics of a pending immigration case, including whether someone has an order for removal or an immigration hearing has been scheduled.

“Having those numbers is pivotal,” Rose said, cautioning the databases rely on information submitted by ICE and Department of Homeland Security employees that, given the increased rate of apprehensions and detentions, may not be up to date.

The ICE detainee database also can be searched using someone’s first and last name, country of origin and exact birthdate.

U visa applicants must also be willing to assist law enforcement in their investigation of these crimes.
Denials can leave T visa applicants vulnerable to deportation.
These policies, alongside escalated coordination between law enforcement and other agencies, have heightened fear among survivors applying for the T visa, Dahlstrom explained.
“We are seeing in real time the results of including requirements around law enforcement engagement, especially when there’s greater cooperation with ICE and greater concerns about deportation,” Dahlstrom said.","The T visa, an underutilized lifeline for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, is experiencing a sharp rise in applications, despite increasing processing times and deportation risks.

Also known as T nonimmigrant status, the visa allows people who have experienced severe forms of human trafficking to remain in the country for up to four years if they are helpful to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of their trafficker. Approved applicants can work in the U.S., are eligible for certain state and federal benefits, and can apply for a green card after three years on the visa (or earlier if the criminal case is closed).

Julie Dahlstrom, founder and director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at Boston University, said increased awareness of the visa and the courts’ expanding definitions of trafficking may have contributed to the increase, along with mounting barriers to other pathways for immigrant relief.

Congress created the T visa in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, intending to bolster law enforcement agencies’ capabilities to prosecute human trafficking crimes while offering protections to survivors. The same law also established the U visa, which provides legal status for victims who have suffered substantial abuse as a result of serious crimes including trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault. U visa applicants must also be willing to assist law enforcement in their investigation of these crimes.

“Many [applicants] are eligible for the U visa as well, but they’re taking now over 20 years for an individual to get access … so I think that has influenced lawyers and survivors, if they are eligible for the T visa … to go ahead and also file T visa applications,” Dahlstrom said. “Especially under the Trump administration, we’ve seen more barriers to asylum access, special immigrant juvenile status access, so I expect we’ll continue to see that move.”

USCIS updated the T visa rules in August 2024 with a process called called bona fide determination that gave survivors earlier access to benefits while their application is pending approval. It also granted them deferred action, which places individuals on a lower priority for removal proceedings.

Erika Gonzalez, training and technical assistance managing attorney from the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking, explained that although early access to benefits had existed in the federal statute, it was never implemented because applications were processing fast enough to not need it.

“They have updated the [bona fide determination] process to now have a formal process to engage with, and it does parallel with the sharp increases in filing,” Gonzalez said.

As T visa applications rose, so too did approvals. Last year, the number of approvals broke 3,000 for the first time though it still fell short of the 5,000 cap.

Processing times for T visas have also increased, jumping from a median of 5.9 months in 2014 to 19.9 months this fiscal year.

Denial rates for T visas, meanwhile, have fluctuated.

“We were seeing increased denial rates under the prior Trump administration and then improved rates under Biden,” Dahlstrom said.

Denials can leave T visa applicants vulnerable to deportation. In 2018, USCIS began allowing removal proceedings if an application was rejected with a notice to appear (NTA).

According to a 2022 report co-written by Dahlstrom, which obtained USCIS data through Freedom of Information Act litigation, USCIS issued a total of 236 NTAs to denied T visa applicants from 2019 to 2021. President Biden rescinded this policy with a January 2021 executive order, but last February, USCIS published new guidance once more expanding the circumstances where the agency could issue NTAs.

These policies, alongside escalated coordination between law enforcement and other agencies, have heightened fear among survivors applying for the T visa, Dahlstrom explained.

“We are seeing in real time the results of including requirements around law enforcement engagement, especially when there’s greater cooperation with ICE and greater concerns about deportation,” Dahlstrom said. “These programs are being politicized and, in some ways, weaponized if you’re denied and you’re placed in proceedings.”

Since February’s policy update, at least one person has self-deported after Immigration and Customs Enforcement denied her stay despite her pending T visa application.

So far in the fiscal year 2025, USCIS has approved 1,035 T-visas and rejected 693, which surpasses the number rejected in each of the last four years.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/024d363/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4482x2353+0+356/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F50%2Fca490cfe4027800418cdae9582aa%2Fhuman-trafficking.JPEG,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:57.206008

But as I placed the pump in the gas tank, I noticed a man running full tilt toward me. I’d barely registered that he looked panicked – Maybe he was going to miss the bus? – when several things happened at once.

As he skidded to a halt in front of pump 1, a black Kia peeled into the station and pulled up level with him. Instantly, the passenger door opened and a man in khakis, a full-face balaclava and a tactical vest jumped out.

“Why were you running?” he asked repeatedly in Spanish. He continued to fire off questions, but I only heard the man he was chasing clearly give one answer.

“What’s your name?” the masked man asked.

“Samuel,” he replied.

I glanced over the roof of the Kia to see the driver had stepped out and was standing there with a rifle. As we made eye contact, he slid a gaiter over the bridge of his nose. Still, it took my brain a few beats to process what I was seeing:

This was an ICE apprehension.

‘The new world we live in’

My morning commute had just placed me in the middle of President Donald Trump’s immigration and deportation crackdown.

I’d never seen an ICE arrest in person – only on the news and in videos online. And while it’s true I didn’t know anything about Samuel – or witness the interaction that led to him sprinting through the parking lot – nothing about this encounter felt official.

For one, the masked men were driving a Kia – a family car I don’t typically associate with law enforcement. And the SUV had generic Maryland flag license tags. Though they appeared to be law enforcement, I didn’t hear them identify themselves. Their tactical gear said “police,” but they didn’t seem to be linked to a particular department or agency, and I couldn’t see any badges.

While I watched the driver stash the rifle in the trunk of the SUV, I considered grabbing my phone to start recording. But almost as soon as the thought occurred to me, I pushed it away.

I’m a Black woman in America. I’ve seen how filming the cops can escalate even the calmest of situations – and this already felt charged.

So, as the first agent cuffed Samuel and demanded to know whether he was “legal or illegal,” I stood between the pumps and decided to make it overtly clear that I was watching.

I rankled when they asked to see Samuel’s papers. There was once a time when masked men could’ve cornered my grandparents and demanded they prove they had a right to be in their own neighborhood. The entire scene felt like history repeating.

The pop of the pump disengaging startled me, and I noticed the driver of the only other car at the station had started recording. Emboldened, I slid into my driver’s seat, cranked the car and pulled around to take my own pictures.

But within seconds, the agents had put Samuel into the back of the Kia and sped away.

I got out of my car and walked over to the other witness. Suffice it to say we were both stunned.

“I think he said his name was Samuel?” I said.

The man, who told me he was an attorney with a public defender’s office, scribbled the name on a legal pad. We both stood there for a beat before he said, “This is the new world we live in.”

I forgot to ask the lawyer his name.

What I saw of the arrest lasted less than five minutes, but it felt terrifying and surreal. I never heard the agents tell Samuel why he was being detained. As the masked men put him in the back of the blacked-out SUV, I felt like I was watching someone being kidnapped.

I dictated notes on my phone as I drove to work and then immediately told my editor and colleagues what I’d seen. We agreed it would be a good idea to get the footage from the lawyer and that’s when reality began to set in.

In my panic and fear, I’d forgotten to ask any of the normal journalistic follow-up questions. I only knew the detainee’s first name, where he was apprehended and that the other bystander said he was a public defender.

With little to go on, I began searching for Samuel.

‘Everybody is scared’

I reached out to ICE to see if they could confirm whether their agents had been active in the area that morning and if they’d detained a man named Samuel.

I also emailed the public defender’s office for Washington, DC, the state of Maryland and nearby Montgomery County. They all agreed to ask around and see if my description of the attorney matched a colleague.

Then, I drove back to the gas station. Until recently, I’d lived less than 5 miles from where Samuel was apprehended. This side of Takoma Park is a suburban, close-knit, predominately immigrant community. It’s also not far from where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once apprehended at a local Home Depot.

The gas station is the kind of place where the attendants warmly greet their regular customers and there’s a table for locals to sit and chat while they play the lottery.

But the people I spoke to inside weren’t aware that ICE had been in the area or that someone had been arrested at pump 1. I drove to the U-Haul rental center across the street and asked two day laborers nearby if they’d heard about the incident.

“Yes,” they said.

Although neither man felt comfortable sharing his name with a reporter, both told me they’d heard ICE had apprehended three people in the area that morning. One man was buying coffee when agents stopped him, they said. Another was “just looking for work.”

“Everybody is scared – everybody,” one of them told me. The other showed me a grainy photo of the arrests that were circulating online. Neither knew Samuel.

As I drove away, I was struck by the fact that Samuel probably had family and friends in the area who might not hear from him for days or even weeks.

He’d left home that morning and essentially disappeared.

‘An extraordinarily abnormal thing to witness’

On Friday, I returned to the station to see if the manager had any surveillance footage of the incident. That’s where I met Solomon, an Ethiopian immigrant who won the State Department’s diversity visa program lottery 25 years ago and emigrated to America on a green card.

CNN agreed not to share his last name because of his concerns about the current climate toward immigrants. But since arriving in the US, Solomon said he’s earned a master’s degree and now owns a business. That, he added, is the beauty of America.

“If somebody comes (and) by chance they can get into this land, let’s properly treat them like a human being,” he said, adding some people who seek refuge in the US are fleeing war, starvation and poverty.

“They don’t have any hope,” Solomon said, “but this is a great country – it’s big (on) hope. If people are disciplined and stay away from trouble, you can benefit from that.”

Later that afternoon, my phone rang. Although I didn’t recognize the number, I instantly recognized the man’s voice. It was the attorney I’d met at the gas station, Sagar Vyas.

After a proper introduction this time, we began comparing notes on what we’d seen.

“It definitely seemed like – one of those old terms from the post-9/11 time – like a rendition was happening,” Vyas said, referring to the government’s extrajudicial practice of capturing and transferring suspects to foreign locations during the war on terror.

Vyas told me he typically sits in the driver’s seat while he’s filling the tank, and he only noticed the men in neck gaiters and camo when he went to hang up the pump.

As he grabbed the pen and paper from his briefcase, Vyas said he, as a South Asian man, also debated whether to record the incident.

But Vyas said he felt a sense of responsibility.

“Your parents say when you grow up, ‘When you see an injustice, stand up for them,’” he said. “Those sort of soft voices were in the back of my head.”

Still, he said he was deliberate about every move he made. While I was moving my car, Vyas said he’d asked Samuel for his name, but the agents scolded him.

“The two agents said something to each other, and they decided to just throw him in the car and take off,” he said. “It’s an extraordinarily abnormal thing to witness.”

But, Vyas said, later that night he and his wife agreed there is power in simply bearing witness. It’s like the adage, “a watched pot never boils,” he told me.

“We all need to be pot watchers – as a community, as a people, as citizens of this country,” he said.

If someone’s not monitoring the situation, he said, it’s going to boil over.

‘Targeted enforcement operations’

When I got to my desk on Monday, I had an email from an ICE spokesperson.

It read, in part, “Samuel Antonio Garcia Apilcano, 35, is an illegal alien from Honduras.”

According to ICE, he’d entered the country in 2023 and, after he’d failed to appear at a court date, a judge ordered his removal in absentia. ICE did not state if Samuel had any criminal history, or previous interactions with law enforcement. A CNN public records search didn’t return any information on him either.

“ICE is conducting intelligence-based, targeted enforcement operations in and around the district in an effort to make Washington, D.C. and surrounding communities safe and beautiful again,” the statement said.

It took a few days, but it was a small comfort to know ICE officials had located Samuel, given the sparse information I gave them. And ICE impersonations have also been on the rise, so I found it reassuring to know the men I saw were, in fact, DHS agents.

But the encounter has made me more curious about ICE enforcement tactics, immigrant rights and what bystanders are legally able to do when they’re caught in the middle.

As the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown, it’s becoming increasingly likely that more Americans could have the same experience I did in their own neighborhoods.

Candidly, I’m still shocked by what I witnessed. Though I live just outside the district – where it’s not uncommon to see armed federal agents – no one expects to see masked men in an unmarked car chasing and detaining someone on their morning commute.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21880541-350-772-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-23 06:56:38.841497

“It is unusual for people to be taken into custody at a citizenship interview,” said Hannah Vickner Hough, legal director for the Washington chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations.

Chaudhry’s wife, Melissa, a 2024 congressional candidate in Washington’s 9th District, said her husband arrived at the interview in “good faith.” She described him as a decorated Army veteran and a member of the Olympia chapter of Veterans for Peace.

Court describes fraud, lies; Chaudhry family contests record

Chaudhry has a complicated immigration history. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services notified him of intent to rescind his permanent resident status in 2003, setting off a lengthy legal battle. He applied for naturalization in 2013, but a federal court ruled against him. He has an appeal before the 9th Circuit.

Court records say Chaudhry used aliases, was convicted of fraud in Australia and failed to disclose his criminal history when applying for visas and jobs. In 1996, while living in Sydney, he impersonated a passenger using the man’s passport to apply for a Medicare card, state ID and bank account. Police also found he had used a stolen American Express card more than two dozen times. He pleaded guilty to multiple fraud charges that year.

According to those same documents, he later attempted to re-enter Australia with a fraudulent passport in 2000 before entering the U.S. on a tourist visa and settling in Yakima, Washington. Within months, he married a U.S.-born woman who filed a visa petition on his behalf. On his status application, Chaudhry falsely claimed he had no prior arrests. He later enlisted in the Washington Army National Guard and applied for a reserve officer position with the Yakima Police Department, again submitting false information.

In 2003, his Guard unit was activated for Operation Iraqi Freedom, but he reported a back injury during training before any deployment. That same year, immigration officials moved to rescind his permanent resident status but abandoned the case under the mistaken belief he was serving overseas.

Melissa Chaudhry declined to answer questions about her husband’s misrepresentation of his identity but told KING 5 his charges “never should have been entered into the docket,” and argued that the judge in question should have recused himself. She pointed to a website, keepzahidhome.org, for additional context.

Melissa said her husband’s pending federal appeal likely triggered the interview where he was arrested, saying the nature of the most recent order signaled a favorable outcome for Chaudhry, which ICE wanted to avoid.

By TODD RICHMOND and SCOTT BAUER Associated Press

MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee judge charged with obstructing a federal agency and concealing a wanted person who was in the country illegally told police days after the incident in her courtroom that “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

The comments were captured on body camera footage by Milwaukee police inside Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s home three days before her arrest in April. Dugan told officers she was not aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct.

Dugan was indicted in May and faces charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrived to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Four days later, on April 22, Dugan called police to her house about a flyer from an anti-government group that she, her mother and her sister found at their homes. Police photographs of the flyer show it included a religious screed about how to pronounce the name of God and assertions that Wisconsin residents can legally carry concealed knives.

Her conversation with officers, as captured on their body cameras, was released by police to The Associated Press on Friday. It was first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to that she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty and is fighting to have the charges against her thrown out. The charges against her underscore a clash between Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make an example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.

Dugan has not publicly commented on the allegations.

She told police that she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz’s immigration status.

“I don’t know if he’s an illegal immigrant, which is what they’re claiming,” Dugan said. “I’m not supposed to know that. When they come in front of me, I’m not supposed to know that.”

Dugan denied hiding Flores-Ruiz who federal agents came into her courtroom to arrest.

“I did not hide this migrant in the jury room or in my chambers,” she said. “I had him leave out the back door, which I do when the circumstances warrant it.”

Video from the hallway showed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney leaving through a side door about 12 feet (3.6 meters) from the main entrance.

According to an FBI affidavit, witnesses heard Dugan say something to the effect of “wait, come with me” before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, the affidavit alleges.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that her conduct amounted to directing people’s movement in and around her courtroom, and that she enjoys legal immunity for official acts she performs as a judge.

Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents “down the hall to the administrative offices. What happened after that is their business.”

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers. “We all know that. Very difficult.”

Dugan’s defense attorneys released a statement noting that her comments to police came before she was aware of the criminal investigation.

“Her comments reinforced that she did nothing wrong in this matter and treated the misdemeanor case like any other in her courtroom,” her attorneys said in the statement.

Dugan could face up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/judge-dugan-outside-courthouse.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 14:56:48.928100

""At no time did ICE conduct enforcement activity on school grounds, nor did any officer exit their vehicle while briefly in the parking lot.
""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers.
Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.
His letter continued, ""The Chula Vista Elementary School District is committed to serving every student, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.""","Two unmarked vehicles driven by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers left the parking lot of Herbert Ibarra Elementary School Friday following a confrontation by ""community patrols,"" although ICE officials deny the agency was conducting an operation on school property.

The school's principal, Valerie Jurado, said in a statement to families of students that although she was unaware of any affiliation between the vehicles and any government agencies, she acknowledged how the belief made people uneasy.

""We understand how unsettling this report is and we stand with our community in our desire for ALL our students to be in a safe learning environment,"" Jurado wrote. ""Our teachers and staff remain ready to support our students and ensure a day of calm and learning.

""We encourage our parents and community to take care of one another and support one another during times of uncertainty like this. School communities should be sacred spaces where all students deserve to obtain a high quality education, and all families feel welcomed.""

Jurado reminded parents that ICE agents were not allowed on campus without a signed warrant. The San Diego Unified School District has a dedicated webpage to explain rights, regardless of immigration status: www.sdusdequity.com/protecting-students.

""At this time, there is no indication of any enforcement activity on our campus, and all students and staff are safe,"" Jurado wrote.

Patrick Divver, field officer director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in San Diego, said while the vehicles in the video were operated by ICE agents, they were not there for any operation at the school.

""At no time did ICE conduct enforcement activity on school grounds, nor did any officer exit their vehicle while briefly in the parking lot. Any suggestion otherwise is completely false,"" he told City News Service. ""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers. As a result, the officers pulled into the first available parking lot.

""The interference of activists in law enforcement operations creates unnecessary risks to themselves, the community, and our officers. These actions hinder our ability to remove individuals who pose a threat to public safety and contribute to misinformation that endangers everyone involved.""

Members of the San Diego Self-Defense Coalition, Union del Barrio and Association of Raza Educators, who responded to reports of the vehicles around 6:40 a.m. on Friday, shouting warnings to nearby communities members about an immigration action were planning to host a news conference outside the school at 4 p.m. to condemn ICE actions at schools.

""Immigration and Customs Enforcement has continuously said they are not conducting immigration enforcement actions on school properties, and today's actions contradict their statements,"" the activist groups wrote in a joint statement. ""We condemn the campaign of terror that has been unleashed in migrant working-class communities and the targeting of families with school aged children in and around school facilities.""

Earlier this week, ICE arrested a man near Park Dale Lane Elementary School in Encinitas while on his way to work.

Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.

""We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,"" a letter from the district to families said.

The immigration agencies sent KPBS a statement Wednesday night confirming the arrest and said the man was undocumented and from Guatemala. ICE said in the statement the man was alone in the car when he was stopped and that the woman and child seen in the video arrived at the scene as the arrest was taking place.

""ICE San Diego finds it unfortunate that an individual chose to insert a child into an active law enforcement situation,"" the statement read, before criticizing statements released by public officials such as ""before the facts of this case were fully known.""

Earlier this month, ICE agents arrested a parent outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista during the morning drop-off period. Cell phone footage captured by bystanders and posted online showed federal agents approaching a vehicle on the street.

Divver said in a statement that a woman who had been ordered deported in absentia by a San Diego immigration judge in 2022 was arrested.

""The arrest was part of ICE's ongoing enforcement efforts and was resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds. The school was not involved in the incident, and there was no impact on students, staff or the school premises,"" Divver said.

The arrest prompted Chula Vista Elementary School District Superintendent Eduardo Reyes to inform families and staff in a letter that protocols were in place preventing unauthorized access to schools and limiting law enforcement officials from interacting with students unless there's an active emergency or warrant.

""We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces for all students,"" Reyes wrote.

Reyes recommended that families create a plan for the district to care for their children ""in the event that you are unable to pick them up or drop them off due to unforeseen circumstances.""

PEOPLE reached out to school administrators for the southwest Portland public charter school following reports from local KATU, KGW8, and KPTV, which first reported the decision to relocate amid responses from ICE agents against local protesters outside its facility.

“Cottonwood is currently in the process of an emergency move,” an email message from Laura Cartwright, the interim executive director of the Cottonwood School, read Friday, explaining that it could take multiple days to respond amid the school’s relocation efforts.

Cartwright told KATU earlier Friday that school officials decided to move the school out of concern for their students’ safety, as ICE agents continue using tear gas that neighbors have complained is both toxic and dangerous to the local community.

The charter school’s interim executive director also explained that educators have also routinely found “munitions” on its playground outside.

“In terms of our impact, we have been impacted mostly by chemical weapons that are being used against protesters in the vicinity of our school,” Cartwright told KATU. “So daily, we were finding munitions on our play yard, we were getting footage in the evenings of green gases, and gases being used near our gardens and enveloping our area.”

The school official told KGW8 that Cottonwood moved to a school building owned by Bridges Middle School more than a mile away, which recently moved to a new building for an unrelated reason.

Cottonwood Schools teaches students between kindergarten and eighth grade, according to the outlet. Cartwright told KGW8 that school officials first noticed an uptick in violent clashes and the use of dangerous tear gas towards the end of the last school year, telling the outlet the school was “losing enrollment regularly” due to its proximity to the ICE facility.

""Our garden was enveloped in gases one evening and we started to think we might not be able to mediate this in the school year and open on time,” Cartwright explained to KGW8.

Cartwright told KPTV in another interview that the persistent issues stemming from the ICE agents were “making it unsafe for the future” of the school, which begins its next school year in two weeks as teachers are still moving in to its new location across town.

Hannah Vickner Hough, Legal Director at Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) Washington Chapter, said in a statement: ""It is unusual for people to be taken into custody at a citizenship interview.","Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, a Pakistani native who served in the U.S. military, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Thursday morning during his citizenship interview in Washington state, according to Fox 13 Seattle.

Newsweek has confirmed in the ICE detention database that he is being held at the Northwest Detention Center. Newsweek reached out to ICE for comment via email on Friday.

Why It Matters

Chaudhry's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, with the president having pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in United States history.

Immigrants residing in the country both illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. Many with past convictions, even from decades ago, have found themselves in ICE custody despite spending years without facing serious immigration problems. Some U.S. citizens and those with valid visas have reportedly been swept up in immigration efforts as well.

What To Know

Chaudhry has lived in the U.S. for about 25 years, having served in the U.S. Army in the 1990s until the early 2000s, his wife Melissa Chaudhry told The Seattle Times. During his service, he sustained an injury that still affects his back and neck, leaving him wheelchair-bound, his wife said. He was discharged for medical reasons.

On Thursday, Chaudhry went to a ""naturalization hearing"" in Tukwila, Washington, as he is reportedly already a green card holder and has been working to obtain citizenship for years, Fox 13 Seattle reported.

Chaudhry reportedly faced deportation charges over a decade ago, when ICE sought to remove Chaudhry over a misdemeanor fraud charge from Australia, as reported by The Olympian. The local outlet also noted that he did not acknowledge that charge on his 2001 visa application, and in addition, he reportedly misrepresented his citizenship status on an application to become a reserve officer at the Yakima Police Department.

At the time, The Olympian reported that Chaudhry said he didn't understand the ramifications of the Australia fraud charge and did not recall misrepresenting his citizenship on the reserve officer application.

Chaudhry has two young children with his wife, Melissa, who ran for Congress in 2024.

What People Are Saying

Melissa Chaudhry, Zahid's wife and 2024 Candidate for Congress in Washington's 9th District, said, in a statement: ""ICE has stolen a beloved husband, a fiercely tender father, and a passionately patriotic American. We are all the poorer for it. My family will suffer every day he is apart from us and I have no idea when I will see Zahid again. In the truest spirit of Islam, Zahid has always stood for uplifting humanity. For doing good. For believing the best of people, and striving for peace. He came to this interview in good faith. ICE must release this decorated, disabled American veteran—return the heart of my family—and show the world that America still stands for justice and peace.""

Hannah Vickner Hough, Legal Director at Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) Washington Chapter, said in a statement: ""It is unusual for people to be taken into custody at a citizenship interview. However, we have seen that under this administration, Muslims are being targeted for unusually harsh immigration enforcement. Whatever the circumstances of an individual's immigration process, the government needs to provide the due process protections when an individual is working their way through the immigration system.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a previous statement shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

Shortly after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) officially declared that conditions in Gaza constituted a famine, Türk laid the blame for the humanitarian disaster directly at the feet of Israel.

""The famine declared today in Gaza... is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli Government,"" he said. ""It has unlawfully restricted the entry and distribution of humanitarian assistance and other goods necessary for the survival of the civilian population in the Gaza strip.""

Türk noted that the Israeli military had ""destroyed critical civilian infrastructure and almost all agricultural land, banned fishing, and forcibly displaced the population,"" all of which resulted in the starvation crisis in Gaza.

""It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,"" Türk continued. ""Israeli authorities must take immediate steps to end the famine in the Gaza Governorate and prevent further loss of life across the Gaza strip. They must ensure immediate entry of humanitarian assistance in sufficient amounts, and full access to UN and other humanitarian organizations.""

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the IPC report confirmed that the starvation in Gaza is a ""man-made disaster, a moral indictment—and a failure of humanity itself.""

""Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,"" Guterres emphasized. ""As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law—including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population... No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow—it is now.""

The IPC report emphasized that, as bad as the situation in Gaza currently is, it is projected to get even worse in the coming weeks.

""Between mid-August and the end of September 2025, conditions are expected to further worsen with famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis,"" the IPC stated.

The deportation dragnet

Just about no one in Ireland would say that Irish citizens living in the United States are being treated as badly or being picked off as cruelly as immigrant residents from Latin America, South Asia or Africa. But consternation is on the rise about U.S. policy on immigrant residents and its escalating use of deportation.

Just five undocumented Irish immigrants were deported from the United States to Ireland in the whole of 2021. By the end of July in 2025, that number had already reached 56.

The issue has even been raised in the Dáil, the Irish parliament. There is a sense that the new attention to undocumented Irish, long previously tolerated on U.S. shores, represents another symbolic collapse suggesting that the United States is not the ally it used to be anymore.

Simon Harris, the minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, sought to underline how the official numbers are potentially underestimating the problem. “It is important to note that this figure only relates to cases where a citizen or their family has requested consular assistance and does not necessarily reflect all deportations to Ireland or where a citizen is currently being detained by ICE,” he said.

The rich connection between Ireland and the United States has been forged by more than a century of Irish emigration. There had been a time when Irish immigrants were viewed mostly positively both by the communities where they landed and the U.S. authorities that they interacted with. Increasingly, this is no longer the case. What happens when the system that was once welcoming turns hostile? And how is that experience reflected in how Irish people now treat those seeking refuge on the Emerald Isle?

Lena Deevy, a member of the Little Sisters of the Assumption, is perhaps uniquely placed to speak to both issues. Trained originally as a nurse, Sister Lena worked for almost 20 years in one of Dublin’s most disadvantaged communities, Ballymun. The neighborhood became nationally famous as host to the Ballymun Flats, an experimental public housing project built in the 1960s within utopian ambitions that ran aground on some hard economic realities and practical design flaws. High crime and social marginalization followed.

“Wherever I was,” she explains, “I was always interested in people on the edges.”

Her work in assisting the residents of Ballymun bore fruit but wore her out. And when it came time to take a sabbatical, she was encouraged on a path she never expected—pursuing a Master’s Degree in Education from Harvard University.

Exchanging the tower blocks of Ballymun for the ivory towers of Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1980s was a culture shock, but Sister Lena found her feet supporting the vulnerable Irish migrants who had made a home in the Boston area. The situation they faced then highlights the changes that have taken place in American attitudes to immigrants since the 1990s.

When she began her work at the Boston Irish Immigration Center (now the Rian Immigrant Center), Irish immigrants were protected by targeted visa schemes that had been sponsored by prominent U.S. politicians like two former Democratic members of the U.S. House, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and the late Brian Donnelly of Massachusetts. The programs allowed thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants to regularize their status.

Although she could have easily forged links by making the center a church-related body, Sister Lena chose not to go that route. It was important for her to reach out to those “people who left Ireland because the society had left them behind. Some of them left Ireland because they were gay. Or some of them left an Ireland where they were not wanted, seen variously as undesirable.”

While others celebrated a sanitized version of Irish emigration, Sister Lena confronted the racial and structural privileges that allowed Irish migrants to blend in while other immigrants were hunted. Whiteness offered Irish migrants a kind of conditional invisibility. That same privilege was not extended to Black and Latino migrants, who were much more energetically surveilled and then deported. “You blended in unless you spoke,” she says.

Under her leadership, the center quietly reoriented the landscape of Irish-American immigration advocacy. It began to offer legal aid, trauma-informed support and pathways to stability to all comers.

A historic reversal in Ireland

While her work unfolded in Boston, it carried lessons far beyond the American context. When Sister Lena returned home to Ireland, she found a society shifting from being a migrant-sending nation to becoming a migrant-receiving one. The change has exposed deep inconsistencies in how Irish society understands justice and belonging.

If whiteness once offered Irish migrants a kind of cover abroad, it now risks becoming the lens through which hospitality at home is rationed. The question becomes not just how others treat the Irish abroad, but how the Irish treat people seeking refuge in their midst.

Both the United States and Ireland “now treat the people they don’t want one way and those they do want another,” Sister Lena concludes. And both nations “are classifying whole groups of people as ‘undesirable.’”

Ireland absorbed waves of immigrants from Poland and other new E.U. member states from the late 1990s onwards without much civic uproar, but the more recent arrivals of Chinese, south Asian and African immigrants, joined by thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge, has provoked an “Ireland First” movement similar to the resistance to immigration emerging in the United States.

But there are institutions that push back. Most notably, perhaps, is the hugely influential organization for “Gaelic games,” the Gaelic Athletic Association, which explicitly presents its mission in terms of being “where we all belong.” This year the G.A.A. made its landmark stadium, Croke Park in Dublin, available for the celebration of the Muslim holiday of Eid Al-Adha.

When new G.A.A. clubs like Columbus Gaelic are established in Dublin entirely by migrants to Ireland who seek to embed themselves more fully in their new home, they replicate in a way the role the G.A.A. had long served for Irish immigrants to the shores of America and elsewhere. The G.A.A. is a common first port of call whether an Irish immigrant lands in Knoxville, Dubai or even Kampala to find a group who play the ancient Irish sports.

The Irish Catholic Church has also played a role in confronting a surge of xenophobia in Ireland. The episcopal conference issued a 2024 pastoral letter, “A Hundred Thousand Welcomes? Exploring what hospitality for migrant people means in contemporary Ireland,” which forcefully argued that hospitality was a Christian virtue and responsibility.

Michael O’Sullivan has spent decades working at the intersection of migration and public policy in Ireland. As one of the founders of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, he has been involved in advocacy since the early 2000s.

He cautions against easy narratives of decline or backlash. “I don’t think Irish attitudes have changed that much,” he argues. “There’s no innate or culturally fixed antipathy toward migration. But there’s also no deeply ingrained hospitality either.”

The welcome that exists, he suggests, has always been patchy, shaped more by context and opportunity than by deep-seated conviction. And behind even the most generous public discourse, the Irish state’s approach has long been shaped by what he calls a “security manager” mindset—cautious, gatekeeping and risk-averse.

Sister Lena agrees, noting that in both the United States and Ireland “what alarms me is that in many ways we are more and more seeing migrants as a threat, missing out the rich opportunities and gifts that they bring us.”

Security trumps solidarity

There are significant successes that the Migrant Rights Centre can point to. An ambitious amnesty for undocumented migrants in 2022 allowed more than 8,000 workers to regularize their status in Ireland. But there have also been serious setbacks, most notably a constitutional referendum that successfully changed citizenship laws to make it harder for the children of immigrants to establish themselves as Irish citizens.

Mr. O’Sullivan is clear that progress in Ireland has often depended on the persistence of civil society rather than the emergence of comprehensive state vision. “The Department of Justice always saw immigration as something to be controlled, not something to be engaged with creatively,” he says.

The 2022 amnesty was a breakthrough, but “it was successful because it was exceptional, not because the underlying [immigration] system had changed.”

That system continues to operate according to a logic of deterrence. In recent months, asylum seekers arriving in Ireland have been left to sleep on the streets while awaiting accommodation. And the Irish government, responding to a small but vocal bloc of voters, has begun to quietly reduce social supports like housing assistance for immigrant arrivals. Its deportation orders have been dispatched more rapidly.

“What we’re seeing,” Mr. O’Sullivan warns, “is a quiet sidelining of the 1951 Refugee Convention.” That U.N. agreement created historic protections for asylum seekers and mandated obligations for receiving nations.

According to Mr. O’Sullivan, Irish officials are not abandoning the convention “as loudly” as other E.U. states, “but it’s doing it.”

As in the United States, the official language around migration in Ireland is increasingly shaped by ideas of risk, order and control rather than solidarity or shared humanity. Ireland may continue to tell a proud story about its emigrant past, but it is increasingly distancing itself from its obligations to migrants in the present. The country that once sent its people across oceans to build bridges and skyscrapers now builds bureaucratic walls against those who arrive by ferry.

Irish society aspires to hospitality as an abstraction, Mr. O’Sullivan says, but when push comes to shove, the welcome is often threadbare.

“We’re good at being good,” he says, “until it’s past our door.”

Perhaps that is what makes Cliona Ward’s story so unsettling, exposing how precarious even a “desirable” immigrant’s security can be. The Bible repeatedly insists that solidarity must be expressed for resident aliens, people entitled to particular protections precisely because of their vulnerability. When solidarity can be hard to find and the ground seems to be shifting on a daily basis, large populations in both Ireland and the United States find themselves exposed.

Those lucky to be thoroughly settled in a new homeland must remain vigilant to the temptation to separate what Sister Lena categorizes as the “acceptable people” from the “unacceptable” ones. To do that is to forget how our own histories have so often been shaped by exclusion and flight.

“We need to remember,” she says, “we all belong to each other.”

Today, when we speak of migration, we no longer picture the awe-inspiring journeys of Herodotus, Xuanzang, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, or James Cook, men who ventured across oceans and deserts, through empires and unknown lands without needing a permit to enter and sometimes even received an audience with curious royalties.[1] We forget that their stories represent countless others, unnamed, unrecorded. We overlook the migration of the earliest human, homo erectus and homo sapiens, those bold crossings over mountains and plains, rivers and seas, islands and continents, by people who knew no boundaries, only the pull of necessity, survival, and discovery. They exercised the most ancient human freedom: the freedom to migrate.

Now, when we hear the word migration, our minds leap not to the journey, but to borders, passports, patrols, visas. We ask whether someone’s movement is legal or illegal, allowed or forbidden. We debate thresholds and quotas, risks and threats. Rarely do we ask the more human question: Does a person have the right to move freely? Doesn’t a person have the right to seek safety, pursue happiness, or simply adventure elsewhere?

What once seemed instinctive is now seen as impermissible, unnatural, even immoral. But this distorted view of movement is astonishingly new. It is newer than carriages and clocks, than spectacles and telescopes. For most of human history, the idea that one needed permission to move would have been absurd. Questioning human migration was questioning human nature—it still is. For over 90% of our existence as hunter-gatherers, humans were entirely dependent on movement.

Even with the rise of agriculture and the building of cities, migration between spaces remained natural to individual and social life. Entire communities shifted with the seasons. Trade and travel routes like the Silk Road, the trans-Saharan highways were arteries of constant movement. Nomadic peoples endured. Even the settled recognized migration as a response to drought, war, or opportunity. One needed no reason, or any reason would suffice.

This right to move is older than nearly all others. It predates the right to property, that most revered right in American political mythology. Property only became relevant when humans began to fence off land. Even the American settlers who enshrined property rights had to first migrate across oceans and continents to claim the land often by force. The right to the ‘pursuit of happiness’, enshrined in the US Declaration of Independence (1776), presupposes freedom of movement. Before there was freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, or the right to due process, there was the right to migrate. Kings and empires might silence your tongue, outlaw your prayers, chain your thoughts, but they rarely questioned your decision to migrate. To migrate was beyond question. Often, it was the only freedom you could use to protect other personal rights by going to a new place. As the most respected freedom, it was the guardian of all other rights and freedoms.

Ancient thinkers, and traditions revered it as a sacred endeavour. Herodotus wrote, “Human prosperity never abides long in one place.” Aristotle saw migration as part of the natural order, while Socrates found it preceded new polities and civilizations. Religious traditions elevated migration into a moral duty: Abraham’s journey across deserts, the Exodus of the Israelites, the disciples’ missions across lands and cultures, and the Prophet Muhammad’s Hijra from Mecca to Medina were not mere detours or escapes. They were profound tales of faith, survival, and liberation in these traditions. Similarly, the Buddha’s Great Renunciation, the exiles in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and the Anishinaabe migration were considered sacred journeys in these traditions shaping both the self and the world.

And yet today, that great engine of human history has been stalled. The rise of modern nation-states, colonial cartographies, and rigid immigration regimes has replaced this freedom with control. The invention of passports, visa systems, and surveillance bureaucracies has shackled what was once humanity’s most basic instinct. A species that roamed the earth for millennia now finds itself trapped inside boxes, walled by citizenship papers, embassies, fences, and checkpoints.

Ironically, it was the very colonial powers who once championed expeditions, economic and political adventurism, and settlement expansion that later rebranded rather more peaceful and kinder versions as a threat. The same empires that moved freely across oceans and continents in search of resources and dominion turned around to criminalize movement when it came from the margins. They eagerly promoted a pantheon of liberal rights, including free speech, religion, property, and even humanitarian intervention, but withheld the most ancient and universal of them all: the freedom of movement.

When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, freedom of movement was included but subtly severed from the act of migration. A quiet sleight of hand. The right to leave was affirmed; the right to enter was not. It was a masterstroke of legal illusion, a political magic trick from the Western sleeve that has since cast a spell over global consciousness. A disillusion so complete, we forgot that the right to move was indeed the right to migrate; and it was never theirs to define, give or take. It was ours all along.

They even manufactured some baseless rights like preemptive self-defence, preemptive strikes, trade liberalization, and economic embargo, but somehow framed the right to migrate as too unrealistic, too disruptive, too dangerous to recognize. Denying the right to free movement has never been merely a matter of security or order; it reflects much deeper structural concerns. Facilitating and even coercing the flow of capital and resources from the Global South while restricting the movement of people ensures that global inequality remains entrenched, locking entire populations into structural disadvantage. These deeply embedded, often racialized, immigration systems have historically privileged certain regions and populations over others.

This redefinition has traveled far beyond its Western origins. For example, it is not only the United States or Germany that now deport Afghans, the very people they once claimed to protect. So too does Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, who call Afghans their ‘Muslim brethren’, their ‘cultural kin’, their ‘linguistic neighbours’. Yet all these words evaporate at the border. Solidarity collapses at the gate.

Today, we no longer speak of migration as a right. We speak of it as a problem. A crime, a disruption to be managed. The image of the migrant has shifted from that of a seeker or survivor to that of an invader. We no longer greet them with wonder. We do not ask about their journeys, their struggles, their dreams. We fear them. Our attention has shifted from people to policies, from humanity to geography. We have created a world where those most in need of movement are the most forbidden to move. People are trapped in war zones, failing economies, and ecological disasters, not because they cannot escape, but because they are not allowed to. The powerful still glide across borders with ease; the vulnerable are held hostage by the coordinates of their birth. Worse still, this system has seeded hatred and xenophobia, nationalism, and exploitation. It has enabled trafficking where safe passage is denied. It has weaponized difference and built moral hierarchies out of geography. Borders are no longer lines; they are Great Walls of China, dividing people, excluding them.

To forget this freedom is not only to forget our past; it is to endanger our future. In boxing humanity into artificial lines, we have betrayed the very idea of freedom. We have turned a natural preservation instinct, a birthright, into a crime. We have silenced the journey. And in doing so, we have not only lost sight of our first freedom; we have lost a piece of what it means to be human.

The order prohibited President Trump from denying funding to more than additional 30 cities and counties in far-flung corners of the country, including Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Baltimore, Chicago and Columbus. The issue was their status as so-called sanctuary cities, with local laws that limit assistance to federal immigration agents.

It followed a previous order Judge William H. Orrick of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida issued in April, barring the government from withholding the funding to 16 other cities and counties. The original set was heavily concentrated in California but also included several larger cities such as Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis.

Judge Orrick wrote on Friday that the government had not objected to the motion by the coalition of local governments that brought the lawsuit to widen its reach. He noted that the government had only disputed the legal reasoning of the original decision and was in the process of appealing it.

The funding at issue included federal grants that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. In their original complaint, the groups suing said they had been forced to consider putting on hold an array of capital projects and vital services, unsure of whether federal funding could dry up.

“The new plaintiffs have each alleged similar reliance on federal funding as the cities and counties and filed declarations showing similar harms to community health, welfare and social services and to their budgetary processes that depend on the regularly authorized grants of federal funding for a variety of critical needs,” Judge Orrick wrote.

The decision on Friday also came as the Trump administration ratcheted up immigration operations over the summer, steering unprecedented resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with an eye to drastically scaling up deportations.

In the past week, the Trump administration has increasingly embedded immigration agents with more than a dozen law enforcement agencies and city police that it has ordered to blanket the District of Columbia, having agents check the immigration status of people arrested over minor offenses or briefly held up during routine traffic stops.

While cutting funding across the federal government, the administration also vastly expanded funding for ICE through the tax and spending bill Congress passed in July.

It has simultaneously knocked down barriers that prohibited the sharing of sensitive data stored at agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Education Department for use in immigration enforcement, in what multiple lawsuits have claimed was a breach of federal privacy laws.

The lawsuit before Judge Orrick is one of the most ambitious cases against the Trump administration this year trying to resist the president’s immigration policy.

After the Supreme Court limited the power of federal judges in June to impose sweeping injunctions blocking policies across the country, outside groups have struggled to secure rulings that apply to more than a narrow subset of individuals, organizations or cities and states involved in the litigation.

By moving to include more than 30 additional cities and counties in the earlier decision, the local governments suing to halt the president’s attacks on sanctuary cities effectively brought about a comparable result.

In all, the order reached two dozen additional cities and 10 additional counties across 13 states, including 19 more cities and counties in California that were left out in the original order in April.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/22/multimedia/22trump-news-sanctuary-cities-bfzh/22trump-news-sanctuary-cities-bfzh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 01:56:31.220291

On Aug. 16, Francisco Longoria was driving home with his teenage son and his daughter’s boyfriend when, according to attorneys for the family, several masked individuals in mismatched uniforms jumped out of an unmarked vehicle and surrounded them. The family said they asked for identification but received no response. Without warning, one of the men smashed the driver’s side window and struck Longoria, who then drove away in fear. Moments later, shots rang out. At least three bullets struck the car door near where Longoria’s son was seated, the family’s attorneys said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have confirmed that agents were involved in the incident but offered a different account. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Longoria refused to exit his vehicle and drove toward officers, injuring two. That, the spokesperson said, “forced a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

No one in the family’s vehicle was struck by the gunfire.

The confrontation set off a chain of events that lasted most of the day. After leaving the scene, Longoria called police, telling dispatchers that “masked men” had broken his window and shot at his car.

San Bernardino police said officers responded but did not intervene directly, citing state law that limits local participation in federal immigration enforcement. By late morning, multiple law enforcement vehicles surrounded the family’s home, where advocates said the family feared leaving after the shooting. Agents ultimately departed hours later without making an arrest.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which has been working with the family, said Longoria has no criminal record and was targeted without legal justification. The group has demanded accountability from federal officials and local police.

The incident has already sparked visible community backlash. On Monday, protesters gathered outside the San Bernardino Police Department, carrying signs and denouncing the actions of federal agents. “It doesn’t seem they’re protecting us,” one advocate said. “It seems they’re protecting these bounty hunters and kidnappers.”

Attorneys for the Longoria family plan to present new evidence Friday at a press conference in San Bernardino, where the damaged vehicle will be displayed. “This was a ruthless and violent attack,” attorney Robert Simon of the Justice Team said in a statement. “The family feels they were targeted, racially profiled, and nearly kidnapped by unknown individuals.”

The family is now demanding a full criminal investigation into the shooting. “Mr. Longoria and his family have been here for decades,” the attorneys said. “They are hardworking people without any criminal record. They deserve answers.”",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/snapshot-5-13.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-23 03:56:52.725814

The United States operates the largest immigrant detention system in the world. A record-breaking 60,000 immigrants are currently detained in U.S. facilities. The recent opening of the largest U.S. federal migrant detention center on a military base indicates the intent of the Trump Administration to increase its detention figures through aggressive tactics such as workplace raids and courthouse arrests.

At the same time, advocates warn that the conditions in U.S. immigration detention centers have become increasingly dire. Rounded up through workplace raids and arrests at immigration courts, the number of immigrants in government custody is rapidly exceeding U.S. institutional capacity. Detainees, lawyers, family members, and lawmakers report overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate food, with at least 10 immigrants dying in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody since the beginning of 2025.

The Trump Administration’s aggressive detention tactics have met significant pushback: a federal judge temporarily halted new construction of “Alligator Alcatraz,” an immigration detention facility in Florida, and a New York federal judge ordered the Trump Administration to remedy conditions in New York City migrant holding cells.

Immigration detention is governed by a complex patchwork of federal statutes and regulations, such as the Immigration and Nationality Act, which grants the U.S. government broad detention authority. The Department of Homeland Security and its component, ICE, are primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing these regulations. Yet, the rapid evolution of policy directives, coupled with the distinctive characteristics of detained immigration courts have led legal experts to question the legality of the federal government’s mandate over the detention of immigrants.

The ongoing debate over immigration detention policy raises the fundamental issue of due process as it applies to noncitizens in immigration courts. Although the American Bar Association recently urged the federal government to ensure that immigrants receive due process, lawyers, advocates, and policymakers disagree over how to balance national security and border management with the constitutional and human rights protections owed to noncitizens.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars discuss the evolving legal landscape surrounding immigration detention centers.

In an article in the Stanford Law Review, Paulina Arnold of the University of Michigan Law School traces how U.S. immigration detention became an exceptional regulatory carveout from ordinary civil confinement rules. Arnold claims that immigration detention’s lack of bond hearings and due process is a modern invention rather than a historical norm. Arnold explains that immigration detention was once part of a broad civil confinement system with few constitutional limits, but a mid-20th-century pause in immigration detention spared it from later judicial reforms, leaving courts to rely on outdated precedent. Arnold argues that this history undercuts jurisprudence that defends immigration detention as exceptional and bolsters calls to align detention policy with constitutional safeguards.

In an article in the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Azadeh Shahshahani of Project South and Kyleen Burke of Suffolk County Legal Aid Society, argue that U.S. immigration detention centers exploit detainees through work programs, coercing labor for pennies an hour in violation of international prohibitions on forced labor. Although challenges to these practices are often brought under federal law, Shahshahani and Burke note, parties could benefit from invoking international law, particularly treaties ratified by the U.S. Shahshahani and Burke explain that these treaties prohibit civil detention centers from engaging in forced labor and other internationally condemned practices. Shahshahani and Burke contend that incorporating arguments from these international legal frameworks could promote accountability and end inhumane conditions in detention centers.

In an article in the Brooklyn Law School’s Journal of Law and Policy, Sabrina Balgamwalla of Wayne State University Law School argues that ICE’s unchecked power to transfer detainees causes harms that existing procedures cannot remedy. Balgamwalla explains that these transfers—from public to private facilities, across state lines, and beyond individual courts’ jurisdiction—often place detainees in remote areas, intensifying the obstacles of defending against removal. Balgamwalla attributes this disproportionate authority to systemic failures across all branches of government: statutory and regulatory gaps that fail to constrain ICE, and jurisdiction-stripping laws that block judicial review. Balgamwalla concludes that rather than reforming transfer policies, the entire immigration enforcement model must be redone to embed meaningful safeguards for noncitizens.

Current immigration detention jurisprudence fails to protect the substantive rights of detained immigrants, argues Alina Das of New York University School of Law in a Harvard Law Review article. Das explains that some courts have rejected legal challenges made by detained immigrants out of a reluctance to contradict the political branches. Das asserts that by assuming that the sole interest of the political branches in detention is to seclude and deport immigrants, U.S. courts fail to consider the interests of immigrants. Das contends that the political branches indeed have an interest in ensuring civil conditions for detained immigrants. Das maintains that the failure of the U.S. government to effectuate its “civil detention interest” underscores the lawlessness of the current system.

In an article in the Virginia Law Review, Ingrid Ealy of the UCLA School of Law and Steven Shafer of the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project argue that the unregulated design of detained immigration courts erodes due process and fundamental fairness by creating a segregated court system that systematically disadvantages detainees. The authors emphasize that detained immigration courts prioritize speedy proceedings with minimal representation by counsel, heavy reliance on video adjudication, and limited public access. Ealy and Shafer contend that the rules of these courts give the government immense power over where immigration cases are held. The authors maintain that an understanding of the structure and function of the detained immigration court system is crucial to efforts to research and reform immigration detention policy.

In an article in the Scholarly Commons at Boston University School of Law, Sarah Sherman-Stokes of Boston University School of Law contends that the U.S. government’s “Alternatives to Detention” program entrenches rather than alleviates the harms of immigration enforcement. Sherman-Stokes warns against treating digital surveillance as a humane reform, explaining that such “digital cages” extend a punitive immigration system’s reach into communities. Sherman-Stokes emphasizes that electronic monitoring inflicts a hidden but serious harm and normalizes an expanded enforcement infrastructure. Sherman-Stokes calls for abolishing not only immigration detention but also its digital substitutes, insisting that true reform requires dismantling this carceral surveillance regime.

The Saturday Seminar is a weekly feature that aims to put into written form the kind of content that would be conveyed in a live seminar involving regulatory experts.

Mr. Blanche, for example, asked many more questions about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with former President Bill Clinton than he did about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Gor was involved in providing Mr. Trump information that Jared Isaacman, a businessman and ally of Mr. Musk whom Mr. Trump picked in late 2024 to lead NASA on Mr. Musk’s recommendation, had donated money to Democrats in the recent past.
Mr. Isaacman had directly told Mr. Trump about those donations in their 2024 meeting during the presidential transition, according to two people with knowledge of the events, but Mr. Trump claimed to be learning of them for the first time.
“There is no list” of powerful clients, she said, no blackmail campaign by Mr. Epstein to extort money or favors, and no dark secrets about Mr. Trump, who once considered Mr. Epstein a close friend.","It followed a previous order Judge William H. Orrick of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida issued in April, barring the government from withholding the funding to 16 other cities and counties. The original set was heavily concentrated in California but also included several larger cities such as Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis.

Judge Orrick wrote on Friday that the government had not objected to the motion by the coalition of local governments that brought the lawsuit to widen its reach. He noted that the government had only disputed the legal reasoning of the original decision and was in the process of appealing it.

The funding at issue included federal grants that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. In their original complaint, the groups suing said they had been forced to consider putting on hold an array of capital projects and vital services, unsure of whether federal funding could dry up.

“The new plaintiffs have each alleged similar reliance on federal funding as the cities and counties and filed declarations showing similar harms to community health, welfare and social services and to their budgetary processes that depend on the regularly authorized grants of federal funding for a variety of critical needs,” Judge Orrick wrote.

The decision on Friday also came as the Trump administration ratcheted up immigration operations over the summer, steering unprecedented resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with an eye to drastically scaling up deportations.

In the past week, the Trump administration has increasingly embedded immigration agents with more than a dozen law enforcement agencies and city police that it has ordered to blanket the District of Columbia, having agents check the immigration status of people arrested over minor offenses or briefly held up during routine traffic stops.

While cutting funding across the federal government, the administration also vastly expanded funding for ICE through the tax and spending bill Congress passed in July.

It has simultaneously knocked down barriers that prohibited the sharing of sensitive data stored at agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Education Department for use in immigration enforcement, in what multiple lawsuits have claimed was a breach of federal privacy laws.

The lawsuit before Judge Orrick is one of the most ambitious cases against the Trump administration this year trying to resist the president’s immigration policy.

After the Supreme Court limited the power of federal judges in June to impose sweeping injunctions blocking policies across the country, outside groups have struggled to secure rulings that apply to more than a narrow subset of individuals, organizations or cities and states involved in the litigation.

By moving to include more than 30 additional cities and counties in the earlier decision, the local governments suing to halt the president’s attacks on sanctuary cities effectively brought about a comparable result.

In all, the order reached two dozen additional cities and 10 additional counties across 13 states, including 19 more cities and counties in California that were left out in the original order in April.

She also insisted that a “client list” of the rich and powerful associated with Mr. Epstein did not exist, and denied any scheme to blackmail his associates. The Justice Department and the F.B.I. had concluded in July that there was no specific “client list” for Mr. Epstein’s trafficking ring, and no credible evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”

Mr. Epstein’s victims and their families had objected to the interview, and Ms. Maxwell’s subsequent transfer to a cushier prison, accusing Mr. Trump of offering a sweetheart deal to someone prosecutors say has a history of self-serving falsehoods.

Here’s what happened:

Maxwell praised Trump and distanced him from Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell acknowledged the social relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein but denied any connection between Mr. Trump and the sex-trafficking ring. She also denied recruiting an underage victim of Mr. Epstein who said she had been recruited while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate and club, in 2000.

“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago,” Ms. Maxwell said. Virginia Giuffre, who was 16 at the time, said she was approached by Ms. Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago and invited to become Mr. Epstein’s traveling masseuse. She said the two of them then groomed her to perform sexual services and passed her around “like a platter of fruit” to rich and powerful predators in Mr. Epstein’s circle, including Prince Andrew of Britain.

Neither Ms. Maxwell nor Mr. Blanche, who was Mr. Trump’s trial lawyer before becoming deputy attorney general, mentioned Ms. Giuffre by name during the interview. But Ms. Maxwell denied a specific allegation made by Ms. Giuffre — that Andrew had forced her to have sex at Ms. Maxwell’s home in London — as “absolute rubbish.” Ms. Giuffre died by suicide this year.

Ms. Maxwell, who is seeking a pardon or reduction of her sentence, downplayed Mr. Trump’s long friendship with Mr. Epstein and went out of her way to praise the president. Mr. Trump, asked whether he would consider pardoning Ms. Maxwell last month, said, “I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I haven’t thought about.”

“I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Ms. Maxwell said during the interview. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Maxwell said she believed Epstein didn’t kill himself.

Ms. Maxwell, who was not present for Mr. Epstein’s death, speculated that Mr. Epstein did not commit suicide. She did not offer any particular theory of what had instead happened, but downplayed the possibility that someone had Mr. Epstein killed with the intention of eliminating evidence of the sex-trafficking ring.

“I don’t see that,” Ms. Maxwell said. “I think, is it possible? Of course it’s possible. But I don’t know of any reason why, and I don’t believe in the blackmail or in any of this, I don’t think Epstein had a hit on like that. If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.”

A yearslong Justice Department investigation concluded that Mr. Epstein, who was found dead in his cell with a bedsheet tied around his neck in 2019, died by suicide, not foul play.

Blanche appeared to play political favorites with his questions.

At several crucial moments in the expansive interview, Mr. Blanche peppered Ms. Maxwell with questions about some of Mr. Epstein’s associates, while dropping other lines of questioning when the conversation appeared to be politically inconvenient.

Mr. Blanche, for example, asked many more questions about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with former President Bill Clinton than he did about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Trump. In the end, Ms. Maxwell denied that either had engaged in sexual misconduct or other inappropriate behavior, and said neither had visited Mr. Epstein’s private islands.

At one point, as Ms. Maxwell defended Mr. Epstein and denied the allegations of sex trafficking, she said associates of Mr. Epstein had been unfairly vilified for their relationships with him.

“Some are in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers,” Ms. Maxwell said. She did not make clear whom she meant, but at another point she said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, once joined Mr. Epstein on a trip to hunt for dinosaur bones in the Dakotas. She added that there was no way Mr. Epstein’s associates “would be with him if he was a creep or because they wanted sexual favors.”

Mr. Blanche immediately moved on, and the claim that other associates of Mr. Epstein work in the Trump administration was never brought up again.

In other exchanges, Mr. Blanche came across as unusually deferential. At one point, he reassured Ms. Maxwell that “if I think that you’re not being honest, or that you’re missing something, I’m not going to — this isn’t ‘got you.’” When he ended the second day of the interview with Ms. Maxwell, he complimented her for going through with the interview and said that “we’ll be in touch soon.”

Maxwell discussed her and Epstein’s connections to the rich and powerful.

Mr. Blanche asked Ms. Maxwell about many of the rich and powerful figures in Mr. Epstein’s orbit, but got little out of her. She named many celebrities, businessmen and politicians — Elon Musk, Andrew M. Cuomo, John F. Kerry, Edward M. Kennedy, Sarah Ferguson, Naomi Campbell, Alan Dershowitz, Kevin Spacey and Larry Summers — but said they were simply friends or had business relationships with her and Mr. Epstein.

She described, for instance, how she and Mr. Musk had met in 2010 or 2011 at a party for Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, and said that she had learned through legal discovery that Mr. Musk and Mr. Epstein had communicated by email. Mr. Musk, in the midst of a public spat with Mr. Trump earlier this year, had said that the president’s name was “in the Epstein files” and “that is why they have not been made public”

Ms. Maxwell also said Mr. Epstein had been close to Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel, but under further questioning she said she remembered little of their encounters, or why he had been close to Mr. Epstein.

Maxwell denied working with intelligence agencies.

One of the conspiracy theories surrounding Mr. Epstein is the unfounded accusation that the sex trafficking was a means to collect blackmail material on his powerful and influential associates. Particularly in right-wing circles, the theory goes further to suggest that Mr. Epstein was being paid for the blackmail effort in connection with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, like the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and even the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.

Ms. Maxwell emphatically denied most of those accusations, and said she had no knowledge of others. In one particularly noteworthy exchange, Mr. Blanche asked if she had ever had contact with a Mossad agent.

“Well, not deliberately,” Ms. Maxwell said.

“Pardon me?” Mr. Blanche asked.

She repeated, “Not deliberately.”

Mr. Blanche did not ask what she meant by that, and moved on.

“I am pleased to announce that I am promoting Sergio Gor to be our next United States Ambassador to the Republic of India, and Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

He claimed that Mr. Gor and his team had placed nearly 4,000 people across government, a figure that could not be independently verified, and called him a “great friend, who has been at my side for many years.”

The president also said that “for the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda.”

Mr. Gor would need to be confirmed by the Senate for the ambassadorship, although the special envoy role can be made simply by appointment. His nomination to the ambassadorship comes as a sudden rift has developed between the United States and India amid Mr. Trump’s threats of punishing tariffs, rocking a friendship between the world’s two largest democracies that had seemed to be flourishing just months ago.

Mr. Gor was valued by the president for his perceived loyalty, and his willingness to freeze out of government people he considered insufficiently pure in that regard. But he was also criticized by others as capricious in his decisions. And he fought bitterly with Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s billionaire adviser who ran an effort that ripped through existing government systems in the name of cutting costs and who himself often fought with others in the government.

Mr. Gor was involved in providing Mr. Trump information that Jared Isaacman, a businessman and ally of Mr. Musk whom Mr. Trump picked in late 2024 to lead NASA on Mr. Musk’s recommendation, had donated money to Democrats in the recent past. Mr. Trump decided to pull the nomination from the Senate confirmation process on Mr. Musk’s last day working at the White House. Mr. Isaacman had directly told Mr. Trump about those donations in their 2024 meeting during the presidential transition, according to two people with knowledge of the events, but Mr. Trump claimed to be learning of them for the first time.

Several people, including Mr. Trump, were later said to have been unhappy about how the situation had played out that day, according to a person familiar with the remarks.

Mr. Gor has also been a focus of a crush of negative news stories that have raised questions about his personal back story and how he rose to prominence in Mr. Trump’s world.

Mr. Gor previously worked for Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He has over several years had close relationships with a number of people in the president’s extended orbit, including his son Donald Trump Jr. In 2024, the super PAC he ran was heavily backed by the former Marvel Entertainment executive Isaac Perlmutter, a friend and member of Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club in Florida.

“We haven’t had to bring in the regular military, which we’re willing to do if we have to,” Mr. Trump said. “After we do this, we’ll go to another location, and we’ll make it safe.”

Mr. Trump then called Chicago “a mess” and said that “we’ll straighten that one out.”

“Probably next, that will be our next one after this, and it won’t even be tough,” he said, adding, “I think Chicago will be our next and then we’ll help with New York.”

Later, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if he had taken any concrete steps toward bringing a federal crackdown to Chicago. The president said he had not.

“When we’re ready, we’ll go in and we’ll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C.,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s comments suggest he will use the crackdown on Washington as a template for other cities around the country. But he would have limited ability to deploy the show of force in the same way he did in D.C.

Its unique status as a federal district, not a state, means Mr. Trump can wield greater control in Washington than in other cities. While the Home Rule Act allowed the president to take temporary control of D.C.’s police force during what he portrayed as an emergency, similar laws do not exist for other cities.

And while Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard, governors typically command the Guards in their states.

That said, Mr. Trump would have a number of ways to display a show of force. Courts have already upheld his federalization of National Guard troops in California, most likely emboldening the president to deploy other states’ Guard troops.

Mr. Trump could also order a surge of federal law enforcement officers from the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies to descend on Chicago.

But the most extreme step Mr. Trump could take would be to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the active-duty military for civilian law enforcement in American cities. Mr. Trump has mulled doing so in the past, in response to protests, but said on Monday that such a step had not been necessary.

The president has been suggesting for weeks that he might deploy National Guard troops to other cities, including Chicago, which is experiencing a historic drop in homicides. The city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, responded to Mr. Trump’s comments, calling a potential deployment of National Guard troops “unlawful” and “unsustainable.”

Mr. Johnson, a Democrat, said he had not received any communication from the Trump administration about a plan.

“There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,” Mr. Johnson said.

Murders, shootings and robberies have fallen significantly in Chicago in 2025, police statistics show.

Crime in Washington was already declining before Mr. Trump ordered a takeover of the city’s police force.

Mr. Trump said on Monday that the takeover had produced a week without a homicide and that it was “the first time in memory that that’s happened.”

But D.C. has already had several weeks this year without a homicide, including a stretch in late February and early March in which the city did not experience a homicide for more than two weeks, according to police statistics.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also fired Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command, a Defense Department official said on Friday. The Pentagon offered no immediate explanation why.

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the firing of General Kruse, who had a long career of nonpartisan service, was troubling.

“The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” Mr. Warner said.

The Defense Intelligence Agency is in charge of collecting intelligence on foreign militaries, including the size, position and strength of their forces. The agency provides the information to the military’s combatant commands and planners at the Pentagon.

The senior defense official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that General Kruse would no longer serve as the intelligence agency’s director, although it was not clear if he would be offered a different position in the Air Force or if he would retire. Two congressional officials said lawmakers were notified on Friday that Mr. Hegseth had fired General Kruse because of “a loss of confidence” in the senior officer.

Days after U.S. military strikes hit three of Iran’s nuclear sites in June, the Defense Intelligence Agency drafted a preliminary assessment that suggested Tehran’s nuclear program was set back only by months. Reports about the assessment by CNN and The New York Times prompted a fierce backlash from the White House.

In the days that followed, the White House and senior intelligence officials tried to paint a different picture, of a more successful operation against Iran.

Mr. Warner linked Mr. Kruse’s firing directly to his agency’s assessment of that operation.

“That kind of honest, fact-based analysis is exactly what we should want from our intelligence agencies, regardless of whether it flatters the White House narrative,” Mr. Warner said. “When expertise is cast aside and intelligence is distorted or silenced, our adversaries gain the upper hand and America is left less safe.”

General Kruse’s firing was earlier reported by The Washington Post.

It was unclear who would replace General Kruse, a 34-year Air Force veteran who had served in numerous senior intelligence jobs in Washington and overseas, including positions overseeing military intelligence operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Indo-Pacific region.

The agency’s deputy director, Christine Bordine, will serve as acting director until General Kruse’s successor is approved by the Senate.

Several former senior intelligence officials said General Kruse has had a target on his back since the early days of the second Trump administration.

A visit by members of Elon Musk’s government efficiency team to D.I.A. headquarters earlier this year was disastrous, with DOGE members concluding the agency was bloated and its missions ill-defined, one former senior official said.

Another official said the Trump administration was upset with the agency’s slow development of a database tool and wanted General Kruse to ditch it in favor of commercial systems. The tool, known as MARS, is meant to make managing intelligence data easier. It has been under development for years, under multiple administrations.

After the agency’s preliminary assessment of the military strikes in Iran became public, some White House officials began focusing on the fact that General Kruse had been appointed during the Biden administration. Some Trump administration officials want to replace all military leaders appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the official said.

Other Trump administration officials viewed D.I.A. as too large, and were impatient for quick change.

The agency was created to be the military’s primary all-source intelligence shop, and many hoped it would replace the intelligence efforts of individual armed services. But the Pentagon never shut down the other service intelligence agencies.

So the Defense Intelligence Agency became the home of the misfit toys — missions and assignments no one else wanted or needed, the former defense official said.

Ms. Maxwell has been seeking to overturn or reduce her 20-year sentence, giving her a powerful incentive to tell Mr. Trump’s team what it wanted to hear.

Mr. Epstein’s victims and their families vehemently objected to the interview, and her subsequent transfer to a cushier prison, accusing Mr. Trump of offering a sweetheart deal to a convicted sex offender who would say anything to protect herself, and him.

In fact, many of Ms. Maxwell’s statements appeared to buttress Mr. Trump’s contention that the Epstein case is old news. He has urged supporters to drop their obsession with uncovering new evidence of a sinister conspiracy involving wealthy and powerful men.

During the interview, Ms. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for aiding in Mr. Epstein’s trafficking of underage girls, calmly swatted down any suggestion that there were significant details in the government’s investigative files that had not already been made public.

“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,” Ms. Maxwell said in a muffled English accent in the conference room of a Florida courthouse. “I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way.”

Ms. Maxwell — who, according to prosecutors, has a history of self-serving falsehoods — knocked down the central pillars of the Epstein conspiracy theories, one by one. “There is no list” of powerful clients, she said, no blackmail campaign by Mr. Epstein to extort money or favors, and no dark secrets about Mr. Trump, who once considered Mr. Epstein a close friend.

She disputed the official narrative on only one point, but it was an essential one — the government’s finding that Mr. Epstein’s jailhouse death by hanging in 2019 was self-inflicted.

“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she told Mr. Blanche, adding that she had no idea who killed her onetime lover and employer. “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay somebody, a prisoner, to kill you for $25 worth of commissary” items.

Mr. Blanche’s highly unusual sit-down with Ms. Maxwell, 63, was followed by her transfer from a restrictive prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas.

Ms. Maxwell, who is seeking a pardon or reduction of her long prison sentence for sex trafficking, downplayed the president’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. She went out of her way to tread lightly when the subject turned to Mr. Trump, who has not ruled out issuing her a pardon.

“President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” she told Mr. Blanche. “I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.”

She described Mr. Trump as “a gentleman in all respects.”

Ms. Maxwell also denied recruiting an underage victim of Mr. Epstein who said that she had been recruited while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.

“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago,” Ms. Maxwell said. The victim, Virginia Giuffre, who was 16 at the time, said she was approached by Ms. Maxwell at the resort and invited to become Mr. Epstein’s traveling masseuse.

Whatever Ms. Maxwell’s motives, or the veracity of her statements, the audio provides a glimpse into the life of a woman who lived in the shadow, and service, of powerful and profoundly troubled men — first her father, the British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, and then Mr. Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell, now confined to a cell and prison togs, relayed to Mr. Blanche, with an air of detachment that at times suggested she was talking about someone else, details of her former life with Mr. Epstein, adjacent to fame and power, without material want or guardrails.

At one point, she casually described how Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary, once joined Mr. Epstein on a trip to hunt for dinosaur bones in the Dakotas. At another, she dismissed the suggestion that former President Bill Clinton was among the men who received massages in her presence.

When Mr. Blanche asked her if there were “any international businessmen or politicians” whose close relationship with Mr. Epstein had not received sufficient public scrutiny, she replied: “Off the top of my, head, I can think of Ehud Barak,” the former Israeli prime minister.

Pressed about many famous people in Mr. Epstein’s orbit, Ms. Maxwell disclosed very little. Over and over, she said that the celebrities — Elon Musk, Andrew M. Cuomo, John F. Kerry, Ted M. Kennedy, Sarah Ferguson, Naomi Campbell, Kevin Spacey and Larry Summers — were just friends with her and Mr. Epstein.

At times, she defended Mr. Epstein, suggesting his behavior changed after he began taking testosterone in the late 1990s. “That altered his character,” she said. “He became more aggressive.”

She described her amazement at how the myth of Mr. Epstein still had such a hold on the American public — more than 15 years after he was first charged.

“So that narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what —basically this is like a Salem witch trial,” she said. “People have gone and lost their minds for this thing. I understand that. But the issue is, how do you satisfy a mob who can’t understand the lifestyle because it’s like P. Diddy in Redux on TV with Clintons and Trump. I mean, it’s — it’s bananas.”

Ms. Maxwell was dismissive of Mr. Epstein’s documented history of preying on young women and underage girls, despite her own conviction on enabling his behavior. She said she never saw Mr. Epstein encourage men to have inappropriate contact with his masseuses, minors or young women.

Asked if she knowingly selected girls for Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell replied, “I never ever checked their age and I never checked their credentials.”

For the most part, she remained composed. But she became momentarily rattled, it seemed, when Mr. Blanche asked her to discuss the intimate details of her own relationship with Mr. Epstein, particularly whether she suspected that he was cheating on her.

“I’m not stupid, I’m very bright, I’ve had an excellent education, I traveled all over the world, I had had boyfriends,” Ms. Maxwell said, appearing to struggle to find the right words. “But I had never met or understood that somebody could be so — would lie to me.”

In the interviews, Mr. Blanche, an experienced and polished trial lawyer, appeared at times to be conducting a not-unfriendly direct examination of Ms. Maxwell, guiding her through a series of tough questions but seldom following up on her evasions or statements that conflicted with established facts about the Epstein case.

Ms. Maxwell went so far as to suggest that none of the famous men who hung out with Mr. Epstein came for sex.

“If you met Epstein, there is no way that this cast of characters, of which it’s extraordinary, and some are in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers, and you know, would be with him if he was a creep or because they wanted sexual favors,” she said. “A man wants sexual favors, he will find that. They didn’t have to come to Epstein for that.”

Mr. Blanche did not press her.

The release of the transcripts and the audio came on the same day the Justice Department sent Congress thousands of pages of documents related to its investigation into Mr. Epstein in response to a subpoena from a House committee.

This spring, Mr. Trump was told by Attorney General Pam Bondi that his name appeared in unreleased files from the investigation. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to the case, and the files are likely to contain references to many people who came in contact with Mr. Epstein.

In the end, Ms. Maxwell said nothing to challenge those conclusions, and even pushed back on the idea that the two men were actually friends.

Mr. Trump has denied that he sent an enigmatic and affectionate note for a book compiled by Ms. Maxwell to celebrate Mr. Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.

When Mr. Blanche asked if she remembered “President Trump submitting a letter or a card,” she responded, “I don’t.”

Asked to define their relationship, Ms. Maxwell replied, “I don’t think they were close friends.”

Still, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican who chairs the Oversight Committee, praised the department, writing on social media that it was “moving at a pace far faster than anything ever produced by the Biden” administration’s Justice Department.

It was not known what was in the files provided to the panel, which have not been publicly released. A spokeswoman said the committee intended to do so after a thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material were redacted, and after consulting with the Justice Department to ensure that any documents released would not damage ongoing criminal cases and investigations.

Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the panel, said on social media that his team was “beginning a careful review process” of the material that was provided and would “share additional information as we learn more.”

The move was the most significant release of material from the case since the Justice Department and F.B.I. announced in early July that they were concluding the Epstein investigation, prompting intense backlash from President Trump’s supporters on the right.

On Friday, Mr. Trump, who last month threatened to cast supporters out of his political movement over their continued demands to see the Epstein files, seemed to endorse the Justice Department’s handover of the material to Congress.

He told reporters that he had directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to “give them everything you can give them.” Still, the president, who has often fueled conspiracy theories when they have benefited him, continued to insist that any remaining fixation over the Epstein case was a partisan plot stoked by Democrats.

Democrats and a few Republicans on the House Oversight Committee banded together last month to approve a subpoena for the files, forcing Mr. Comer to issue it.

The action was one of the last things lawmakers did before leaving Washington for their August recess, as the G.O.P. faced outrage within its base and a growing divide about how to address the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein investigation. The dilemma had effectively frozen the House floor as Democrats sought to force votes at nearly every turn on whether to release the material and Republicans toiled to avoid having to register a position.

House Republican leaders had hoped that developments during their five-week summer recess away from Washington might curb the fervor from their constituents over the files. But courts blocked the release of grand jury testimony, and Ms. Maxwell’s relocation to a minimum-security prison camp prompted further outcry and questions from lawmakers.

The new release of records may do little to help, given the timing and the fact that the release was only partial. More records are expected to be provided in the coming months. But the delay will most likely prompt continued demands for the files.

At the same time, many lawmakers have continued to call for the full release of Epstein-related material not just to the committee but also to the public.

And House Republican leaders still appear likely to face a bipartisan effort early next month to force a floor vote on a public release of the files. Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and frequent Trump critic, and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, plan to use a procedural maneuver to bring up their measure, which has bipartisan support, requiring the Justice Department to release its records to the public.

He is grateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due process.""

Newsweek reached out to Abrego Garcia's attorney Sean Hecker for comment via email Friday afternoon.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem told Newsweek in a statement that Abrego Garcia's release was a ""complete disregard for the safety of the American people.

Why It Matters

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that, despite the administrative error that led to Abrego Garcia's deportation, he should be removed from the U.S. anyway because of alleged ties to the MS-13 criminal gang and human trafficking charges.

His case was among several challenges brought against the use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to rapidly send immigrants to the Salvadoran prison.

What To Know

Abrego Garcia has been in custody since the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

The Department of Justice said Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager, had transported undocumented immigrants across the country along with co-conspirators. He has denied the allegations, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop.

In late July, two federal judges ruled that Abrego Garcia must be released from custody and returned to Maryland while his trial is pending. His attorneys raised concerns that DHS would immediately detain him again on immigration grounds.

Friday's release comes after a lengthy battle to get Abrego Garcia back to his family after his arrest by federal agents in early March.

He was swiftly taken south before being placed on one of two planes that landed in El Salvador on March 15, despite a court order barring the removals, and a 2019 order preventing his deportation to his home country.

Abrego Garcia's family and Democrats in Congress fought for his return, which the Trump administration maintained for several weeks was not in their power, despite the U.S. Supreme Court stepping in.

What People Are Saying

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, in a statement to Newsweek on Friday: ""Activist liberal judges have attempted to obstruct our law enforcement every step of the way in removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country. Today, we reached a new low with this publicity hungry Maryland judge mandating this illegal alien who is a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator be allowed free.

""By ordering this monster loose on America's streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people. We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.""

U.S. Democratic Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, in a statement shared with Newsweek: ""Despite the Trump Administration's relentless efforts to defy our Constitution, our legal system has worked its will and is upholding Kilmar Abrego Garcia's right to due process. Following the court's ruling, I'm glad that he is being returned to his home and his family, where he rightly belongs.

""While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia's rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained – because due process in this case does not end with his release. Mr. Abrego Garcia must continue to be allowed to defend himself in court, where the Trump Administration must make its case before taking any further action against him. This is a matter that's greater than just this one case or one man – if one person's rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk.""

Hecker Fink, the law firm representing Abrego Garcia, in a press release August 19 on a motion to dismiss: ""The filing argues that the government has engaged in a vindictive prosecution, seeking to penalize Abrego Garcia for asserting his rights, rather than accepting an unjust outcome.

""Our motion makes clear that such tactics are inconsistent with principles of fairness and justice, and that the prosecution should be dismissed.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to Newsweek in June: ""Abrego Garcia was never an innocent 'Maryland Man'– Abrego Garcia is an illegal alien terrorist, gang member, and human trafficker who has spent his entire life abusing innocent people, especially women and the most vulnerable. Abrego Garcia will now return to the United States to answer for his crimes and meet the full force of American justice.""

What Happens Next

The DHS has made it clear that it intends to deport Abrego Garcia once his criminal trial concludes.

Ahead of his release, citing concerns that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would detain him on his return to Maryland—rather than honor an order that he remain under observation instead—his attorneys said they had obtained private security for Abrego Garcia.

Protester and veteran Daryn Herzberg told us about an altercation he had with ICE employees that he says took place about a week ago.

“Normally, what I like to do is I shout at them from the sidewalks, sometimes a driveway. They yell at us to get off the driveway. They started putting on their gas masks and everything. That means they're going to come out, and they're going to come out and force. So I usually back up, get off the driveway. I like to lower my volume and talk to them face to face with them, because now I got a person I can talk to directly instead of just yelling across the courtyard. So while I'm standing there waiting for them to come up to us, ICE agents came out of this side gate here sprinting and speared me in the back and knocked me into the ground, landed on my shoulder, messed up my chest. I'm still having a bit of a hard time breathing,” said Herzberg.

Next door to the ICE building is the Cottonwood School.

because of what they say are the impacts of ICE tactics.

“Well, in terms of our impact, we have been impacted mostly by chemical weapons that are being used against protesters in the vicinity of our school. So daily, we were finding munitions on our play yard, we were getting footage in the evenings of green gases, and gases being used near our gardens and enveloping our area,” said Laura Cartwright, the interim executive director of the Cottonwood School.

A couple blocks away from the ICE building is where Elle George lives. After about a month of protests, she too is on her way out.

“I started experiencing negative effects from all the gases they're using. And my doctor determined that it was medically necessary for me to relocate. I'm disabled, so when things trigger problems in my body, there could be serious consequences,” said George.

We've been trying to get a hold of ICE for their side of the story, but we haven’t heard back. We asked about the tactics they've used. On Thursday afternoon we asked about the use of gas that allegedly impacted the Cottonwood School. On Thursday evening we reached out about the alleged impacts of gas deployment in the surrounding community.

That being said, there's been tension on both sides of the picket line.

A few neighbors have been about noise from some protesters. One even filed a lawsuit hoping that the city could crack down on the noise.

According to ICE officials, border czar Tom Homan visited Portland on Wednesday to let ICE agents know that the federal government ""has their back.""

Mayor Keith Wilson and the Portland Police Bureau say they did not organize Homan's visit.

Wilson put out a statement reading in part, ""The masked and armed federal officers roaming the streets in unmarked vans touted by 'Border Czar' Tom Homan are chilling symbols of fear and oppression, not the freedom, liberty, or opportunity we cherish."" He also said that ""Portland stands firm in protecting our sanctuary city status.""",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/71b002c6-298d-48f7-b770-0acd0636cb6b-ICEFACILITYATTACKcaptioned.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:56:34.031074

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers.
Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents ""down the hall to the administrative offices.
“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers.","MILWAUKEE — A Milwaukee judge charged with obstructing a federal agency and concealing a wanted person who was in the country illegally told police days after the incident in her courtroom that “I didn't do anything that they're saying.”

The comments were captured on body camera footage by Milwaukee police inside Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan's home three days before her arrest in April. Dugan told officers she was not aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct.

Dugan was indicted in May and faces charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrived to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Four days later, on April 22, Dugan called police to her house about a flyer from an anti-government group family members had received at their homes and workplaces.

Her conversation with officers, as captured on their body cameras, was released Friday by police to The Associated Press.

Dugan told police that she didn't know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty and is fighting to have the charges against her thrown out. The charges against her underscore a clash between President Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make an example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.

Dugan has not publicly commented on the allegations.

She told police that she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz’s immigration status.

“I don’t know if he’s an illegal immigrant, which is what they’re claiming,” Dugan said. “I’m not supposed to know that. When they come in front of me, I’m not supposed to know that.”

Dugan denied hiding Flores-Ruiz, who federal agents came into her courtroom to arrest.

“I did not hide this migrant in the jury room or in my chambers,” she said. ""I had him leave out the back door, which I do when the circumstances warrant it.”

Video from the hallway showed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney leaving through a side door about 12 feet (3.6 meters) from the main entrance.

According to an FBI affidavit, witnesses heard Dugan say something to the effect of “wait, come with me” before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, the affidavit alleges.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that her conduct amounted to directing people’s movement in and around her courtroom and that she enjoys legal immunity for official acts she performs as a judge.

Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents ""down the hall to the administrative offices. What happened after that is their business.”

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers. “We all know that. Very difficult.”

Dugan's defense attorneys released a statement noting that her comments to police came before she was aware of the criminal investigation.

“Her comments reinforced that she did nothing wrong in this matter and treated the misdemeanor case like any other in her courtroom,” her attorneys said in the statement.

Dugan could face up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Hannah_Dugan_AP_051525_crop,N,,2025-08-22 23:56:28.073221

He is now being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.

As of Friday afternoon officials with ICE had not explained to Muhammed Zahid Chaudhry's family why he was detained. ICE has not responded to KUOW’s requests for comment.

Chaudhry's wife Melissa said her husband had spent the past two decades trying to get U.S. citizenship. The last time she saw him was when she pushed his wheelchair into a windowless room for his appointment on Thursday.

“This is a microcosm,” she said. “This is a little, teeny, tiny individual situation that is a reflection of what is at stake for us as a nation.”

Melissa Chaudhry spoke to KUOW over the phone while she was nursing the couple's 8-month-old baby. She had words of encouragement for anyone who goes through a similar ordeal.

“I hope that you decide to do more than you ever thought possible, that you decide to do what you would do if the soul of your soul was taken from you with no warning and no mercy and no explanation,” she said.

The U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Service enacted new policies this week that increase the level of scrutiny people face as they try to navigate the citizenship and naturalization process. The new policies include increased scrutiny of anything officials deem “anti-American.”

Muhammed Chaudhry served in the military as a mental health specialist. His wife said after the Sept. 11 attacks, he was approached to work in intelligence for the military, and he refused. She said Chaudhry was told he would not be getting his citizenship anytime soon as a result.

“Intelligence work was to throw somebody under the bus, give them a name, and he said, ‘No.’ He said he didn't want the money, he didn't want the job. He was not going to ruin someone's life like that, an innocent person,” she said. “That violated his moral code, and he wouldn't do it.”

Chaudhry continued to serve in the military until he was medically retired in 2005.

The Chaundrys and their family and friends suspect he has been put on a USCIS government list called the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program or CARRP.

The list reportedly targets people from Muslim-majority countries, people who speak other languages, and have advanced degrees, all based on frequently vague associations with people on a separate U.S. terrorism watchlist.

People who are targeted by CARRP face a delayed naturalization process under what’s called ""extreme vetting,” sometimes becoming undocumented and eligible for deportation.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled earlier this year that the federal government’s use of the program was “arbitrary and capricious,” and violated federal laws.

In its announcement this week, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service enacted new policies to increase scrutiny of people with legal status who support what officials consider anti-Semitic views, or who are supportive of terrorist organizations.

In her campaign to unseat Washington state Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat, Melissa Chaudhry was critical of what she considers the ethnic cleansing and genocide happening in the Gaza Strip, and what she characterized as Smith’s lack of action. Muhammed Chaudhry has also been vocal about his opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza as a member of a Washington Chapter of Veterans for Peace.

In their announcement this week, USCIS officials said they are also taking a closer look at instances of applications the federal government considers fraudulent, or misrepresented.

According to The Olympian, in 2013 ICE officials wanted Muhammed Chaudhry removed for misrepresenting two incidents to officials. In one incident, he was convicted in Australia of using an Australian’s passport to open a bank account and get medical benefits. An Australian man had given him that passport to keep until the Australian man could pay Muhammed back for an unpaid taxi fare.

The other incident alleges that Chaudhry misrepresented his citizenship when he applied to become a reserve officer for the Yakima Police Department.

Chaudhry told The Olympian in 2013 he doesn’t remember misrepresenting his citizenship to Yakima Police. He also said he wasn’t clear about the incident in Australia, to which he pleaded guilty. Other than these two instances, his wife said he has a clean record.

But he said there may be circumstances when ICE comes on school campuses in the future.

“Day one, you’re not going to see us,” Lyons told NBC News in an interview on Thursday.

But he did not rule out the possibility of ICE needing to come on school campuses in the future in special circumstances. Lyons said ICE officers may need to make welfare checks on students in the district or anywhere in the U.S. if they were identified as an unaccompanied child when they crossed the southern border.

“We want to use our special agents and our officers to go ahead and locate these individuals. And if [there are] some we haven’t, and the last known address was at a school, we just want to make sure that child is safe,” Lyons said. “If we have the opportunity to reunite that parent with that child, that’s what we want to do.”

Lyons also said there could be an “exigent circumstance” that would require ICE to go onto a school campus.

“If it’s an exigent circumstance, something violent going on, yeah, we’ll respond to that,” Lyons said.

At a press conference this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was asked to address fears by some parents that they could be detained by immigration officials.

“I think people who have that concern for themselves personally and for all of us who are concerned for them and their safety are making adjustments,"" Bowser said.

Recently, educators in California have raised concerns about ICE activity near schools. The Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent recently noted at a press conference that a 15-year-old boy was handcuffed by immigration authorities outside Arleta High School in Los Angeles.

A June analysis by a researcher at Stanford University showed that amid ICE activity last spring, there was a 22% increase in absences in California’s Central Valley, an agricultural area that’s home to many immigrant farmworkers. The increase was especially pronounced among the youngest students, according to the research.

In March, a group representing 78 large school districts across the country said the rescission of ICE’s sensitive location policy, which limited enforcement action around schools, was leading to an increase in absenteeism and anxiety among students.

In the NBC interview, Lyons also addressed reports that some U.S. citizens have recently been arrested by ICE agents. Some were arrested for allegedly assaulting ICE officers, while others have been arrested in cases of mistaken identity and later released.

“A lot of that stuff you are hearing about U.S. citizens being arrested, right? That is a training issue that we are working on. But people don’t have to worry about walking down the street and being asked for their papers or being asked for their passport,"" Lyons said. ""When ICE is going after an individual, it’s a targeted operation.""

He spoke to NBC News from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, which trains new recruits for 130 government agencies in Brunswick, Georgia.

ICE is under pressure to boost its workforce of deportation officers from 6,500 to 16,500 by the end of the year, after the agency received $75 billion from Congress to supercharge deportations of undocumented immigrants. ICE recently signed contracts to support a $40 million ICE officer recruitment campaign and is advertising $50,000 in signing bonuses.

Lyons said the agency has received over 121,000 applications and he believes they can hire 10,000 new agents by the end of the year. Vetting and training ICE agents previously took up to a year, including at a 13-week course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, according to former DHS officials.

To speed up the onboarding process, ICE is shortening that training to eight weeks by eliminating classes deemed repetitive and cutting back on Spanish classes. Firearms training and classroom instruction has also been shortened. Lyons said new recruits will now take classes six days a week instead of five days a week to condense their training into a shorter time period.

“We’re not going to sacrifice the level of commitment we have to the recruits or the level of education training that they get,” Lyons said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250822-ice-federal-agents-washington-dc-ew-419p-69a896.jpg",N,,2025-08-22 20:56:52.936931

AURORA — Congressman Jason Crow (CO-06) is leading Colorado’s Democratic congressional delegation, including Representatives Diana DeGette (CO-01), Joe Neguse (CO-02), and Brittany Pettersen (CO-07), in sending a new letter to the Trump administration seeking answers to questions related to the operations of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal detention facility in Aurora.

The new effort follows an oversight visit by Crow and other Members of Congress to the GEO-operated facility on August 11, where ICE and U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials were unable to answer many of the Members of Congress’ basic questions regarding the facility, including the number of individuals being held at the facility, how many detainees entered the facility in the week preceding the visit, and what percentage of detainees in the facility have a conviction for a violent crime.

In the letter, Crow, DeGette, Neguse, and Pettersen said: “In making our intent to visit known, we also requested that ICE personnel attend the visit in order to receive and respond to our questions in a fulsome manner. Despite the Department ‘vetting’ this request and sending multiple staff from ICE to this visit, they failed to have staff present who could answer the majority of the questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations (OCR). The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.”

The Members Continued: “Whether an oversight visit is announced or unannounced, ICE is seemingly more prepared to ensure the spaces we see are mopped - in our case by detainees themselves - than they are with answering members’ questions regarding the treatment of individuals held in detention. We expect your prompt and thorough reply no later than September 5, 2025.”

Since being elected to Congress, Crow has conducted critical oversight of federal facilities to ensure proper use of taxpayer dollars and promote transparency, including Veterans Affairs’ facilities, military bases, and immigration detention centers. Crow has regularly conducted oversight of the GEO ICE detention facility in Aurora. Since 2019, he’s successfully visited the facility 10 times, and his staff have visited over 70 times. Crow also publishes public reports on his website of oversight visits and conditions at the facility.

Crow recently sued(link is external) the Trump Administration after DHS unlawfully denied(link is external) him access for an unannounced visit to the same facility in July, violating a federal law. Members of Congress have the right to conduct unannounced or announced oversight visits of federal facilities. Crow and the Colorado Democratic delegation’s visit to the GEO ICE detention facility this month, in August, was an announced visit.

Congressman Crow introduced the Public Oversight of Detention Centers (POD) Act, which would codify existing protections for Members of Congress and designated staff to conduct critical oversight visits to oversee facility operations, including any concerns related to public health and the humane treatment of detained individuals. He also led the push for these existing protections through the FY2020 appropriations process, and though included in annual appropriations legislation, the POD Act would formally codify these protections into law.

A PDF of the letter can be found here, with full text appearing below:

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons:

On August 11, 2025, we conducted a congressional oversight visit of the Denver Contract Detention Facility located in Aurora, Colorado. Although the right of Members of Congress to conduct immediate, unannounced oversight visits of facilities operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is established in U.S. law, we provided advance notice of this visit.[1] Despite the advance notice of this visit, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel were unable to answer many of our questions, and we request answers to those and additional questions outlined in this letter no later than September 5, 2025.

In the Department’s denials to Members of Congress who have attempted unannounced oversight of immigration detention facilities in recent months, the Department has stated that advanced notice is required to “vet visit requests to ensure they are for legitimate purposes.” In making our intent to visit known, we also requested that ICE personnel attend the visit in order to receive and respond to our questions in a fulsome manner. Despite the Department “vetting” this request and sending multiple staff from ICE to this visit, they failed to answer many of our questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations (OCR). The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.

We request that you address the following:

What are the top five countries of origin for individuals currently detained at the facility?

Please confirm the total population of detainees detained at the facility disaggregated by gender.

How many detainees entered the facility in the week preceding our visit?

How many detainees left the facility in the week preceding our visit? Of those, how many were deported and how many were released into the community?

Detainees in the facility are classified using a color-coded system that is, in part, based on an individual’s criminal record. Please confirm the number of detainees belonging to each classification at this facility, including high, medium/high, medium/low, and low.

Please describe the system the Department uses to award points and whether the classification system has changed in the last year.

Of the individuals detained at this facility, what percentage do not have a record that includes conviction(s) for a violent crime?

The air conditioning in at least one of the housing pods was not functioning for a period of time in July. How long was the air conditioning not in operation?

When was the decision made to move detainees out of the B2 housing pod as a result, and what other steps were taken to manage the temperature in the facility during that time?

What other housing pods were impacted by this outage?

Did ICE require that GEO staff track the temperature in the housing pods while the air conditioning was not functioning properly? If so, please provide that information.

We have received reports on several occasions of water outages in the facility, including in July and August of this year. On each occasion, how long was the water system not in operation and what was determined to be the cause of the outage?

What efforts were made to provide potable water to impacted detainees?

Was the water provided safe for drinking and personal hygiene?

We understand from GEO staff that counts are occurring in the facility four times per day and that the timing recently changed. During these counts, detainees are in lockdown and may lack access to legal assistance and other resources. Was ICE involved in the decision to change when these counts are conducted and does ICE track how long counts take?

How many counts are contract facilities required to conduct per day?

Has the number of counts completed at this facility increased in recent months? If so, for what reasons?

Why did the timing of these counts change?

Detention standards require that detainees in ICE facilities be able to make calls for free to a specific list of free legal service providers, but otherwise the cost per minute of each call varies by facility. What is the cost, per minute, of domestic and international calls made from this facility?

Is this rate determined by ICE, the GEO Group, or the phone company contracted to provide service at this facility?

Which phone company is contracted to provide service at this facility?

Are detainees provided notice in advance when their access to phones will be limited and under what circumstances is access to phones limited?

Upon entering the facility, detainees are provided with a detention handbook and view a video about their right to legal counsel. In recent months, local legal organizations have been prohibited from conducting regular legal orientation programs that they were previously permitted to hold in this facility. For what reason has ICE prevented the resumption of these programs?

Have previously approved local legal organizations been prohibited from conducting such legal orientation programs at other facilities elsewhere in the U.S.?

If so, please list the facilities and the previously approved local legal organizations.

Posted in multiple places in this facility is a sign reading, “Do You want to Return Home? . . . Requesting to return home now may give you the opportunity to legally enter the United States in the future.” These posters include a phone number to call or the option to speak with an ICE officer. If detainees choose to speak with an ICE officer at this facility, is there a script that the officer follows or a document that outlines the self-deportation process?

If the detainee calls that number, are they connected with an ICE officer?

If so, does the ICE officer on that phone line follow a script or document to explain the self-deportation process, including a potential 3 to 10-year bar from reentry, abandonment of pending adjustment of status applications, and the impact on future visa petitions?

What languages is this service available in?

We have received numerous reports from detainees that they are being pressured to self-deport, including repeat visits by ICE staff – some during the early morning or late-night hours. Are ICE employees directed to initiate conversations with detainees about self-deportation?

If so, please provide the ICE policy guidance that outlines when and how often these conversations are to occur and what information is to be provided to detainees.

An ICE employee confirmed reporting that the former Hudson Correctional Facility in Weld County, Colorado, is under contract with ICE for the purpose of immigration detention. Congressional staff submitted an inquiry to DHS OCR about the status of this facility over two weeks ago and have not received a response. Please confirm when this facility will begin operations.

Will the facility be operated by ICE or by a contract company?

If it is privately operated, which contract company will operate this facility?

What is the contracted capacity and what is the maximum detainee capacity at this facility?

What is the annual value of this contract, and what is the source of funds that will be used to fund this facility’s operations?

Are there any other facilities in Colorado that are under contract, or under consideration for contract, with ICE for the purpose of immigration detention?

Recent reporting by The Washington Post includes the potential use of both the former Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg, owned by CoreCivic, and the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio as additional potential immigration detention centers in Colorado.

Will these facilities be operated by ICE or by a contract company?

If they are privately operated, which contract company will operate each new facility?

What is the contracted capacity and what is the maximum detainee capacity at these facilities?

What is the annual value of such contracts, and what is the source of funds that will be used to fund such contracts?

Under the same reported expansion plans, the Denver Contract Detention Facility would see an expansion of beds from 1,360 to a maximum capacity of 1,530. Is this true, and if so, when would this expansion take effect?

How many total beds would these expansion plans bring to the state of Colorado?

In order for our offices to complete casework and help detained individuals communicate with a federal agency, they must sign ICE Form 60-001, commonly referred to as a privacy release form. In recent weeks, ICE officials have prevented Congressional staff from completing privacy release forms during regular oversight visits, stating that “requests for and completion of privacy waivers must be accomplished of the detainee’s own volitation [sic].” Information provided to our staff has been conflicting and has impeded our ability to complete congressional casework. Is it now ICE policy that congressional staff be prohibited from getting completed Form 60-001’s during the course of an oversight visit?

Is it ICE policy that, in order to complete this form prior to a visit from congressional staff, a detainee must either access the form during their time in the legal library and remit it to a congressional office, or have a congressional office mail them the form?

Does ICE policy permit congressional offices to schedule a visitation, or legal visitation, with a detainee in order for our offices to complete Form 60-001? If so, how many days’ notice is required for these visits? If not, why not?

In the absence of an in-person meeting with congressional staff or Members of Congress for the purpose of obtaining signed privacy waivers, who is expected to complete the witness signature section?

On average, how often are detainees being transferred between different facilities and for what purposes are those transfers conducted?

Are transfers conducted on a regular schedule?

If a detainee is going to be transferred, how much notice are they provided before being moved to a new facility?

When detainees are transferred from Aurora to another facility by bus, what is the average length of that journey? Under what length of journey are detainees provided with food, water, or access to a restroom?

Please confirm the current number of medical and mental health staff assigned to the facility, broken down by role (i.e. physician, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, dentist, psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.)?

What is the average wait time for detainees to access medical and mental health care after submitting the request?

How many detainees have been taken by ambulance for emergency treatment over the past six months?

If a detainee has been prescribed medication prior to entering the facility, what steps are taken to ensure continuity of care?

If a detainee presents with a mental health condition upon entry, what services are required to be provided while they are detained at this facility?

How many detainees are currently in segregation/housed in the Restricted Housing Unit, for what stated reasons, and what is the average duration of their stay in segregation?

Please provide that data for the last six months.

What is the current number of ICE and contract staff at the facility assigned to legal visitation coordination, case management, and detainee intake/release?

In the written statement attributed to the ICE Assistant Director of Public Affairs Emily Covington sent to CBS News Colorado on Tuesday, August 12, two local constituents being held at the facility were publicly named. Is this a violation of The Privacy Act of 1974 and/or ICE policy?

Oversight of these federal institutions is a fundamental responsibility for each of us as members of Congress, and immigration detention facilities demand oversight and accountability to ensure that detainees are treated with dignity and respect. However, the administration is creating greater bureaucratic hurdles for our office when attempting to complete casework on behalf of individuals detained at these facilities. Detainees may have legitimate claims for protection and efforts to create lags in the time it takes for members, and our staff, to gain access to this facility or to mail privacy release forms back and forth between detainees and congressional offices, solely serves to delay this process until an individual has inevitably been transferred to another facility or been discouraged from seeking assistance they have every right to.

Whether an oversight visit is announced or unannounced, ICE is seemingly more prepared to ensure the spaces we see are mopped – in our case by detainees themselves – than they are with answering Members’ questions regarding the treatment of individuals held in detention. We expect your prompt and thorough reply no later than September 5, 2025.

According to Abrego Garcia's lawyers a private security firm will now transport him back to Maryland.
Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15, and upon his return to the U.S. on June 6, he was immediately detained on criminal charges.
Earlier this week, Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a motion before district Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the criminal smuggling charges against him, calling them vindictive and political.
There, Abrego Garcia met and married his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and is raising three kids with her.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to a notorious El Salvador prison and later returned to the U.S., was released today from criminal custody in Tennessee while he awaits trial on federal human smuggling charges.

One of his attorneys, Sean Hecker, said Abrego Garcia was now en route back to his family in Maryland, ""after being unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government's vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back against the Administration's continuing assault on the rule of law.""

Abrego Garcia's case raised basic questions about due process under president Trump's ongoing crackdown on immigrants in the country illegally after he was arrested and sent to El Salvador's CECOT prison in March of this year, violating a U.S. immigration judge's 2019 order that Abrego Garcia had a ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution there. The White House called that deportation an ""administrative error."" He was returned to the U.S. in June.

""He is grateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due process,"" attorney Hecker said in an email.

According to Abrego Garcia's lawyers a private security firm will now transport him back to Maryland.

Abrego Garcia's freedom could be short-lived. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could try to detain him upon his return to Maryland. But a federal judge last month said that, should he be released from detention, ICE is not allowed to immediately take him into custody. Instead he has to be transferred to the Baltimore ICE jurisdiction and his attorneys must be given 72 hours notice prior to his deportation.

Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15, and upon his return to the U.S. on June 6, he was immediately detained on criminal charges. He was in U.S. detention for over two months.

The government accused him of transporting migrants without legal status from Texas to other parts of the U.S. for years starting in 2016. He pleaded not guilty on June 13. He's also been accused of being a member of the MS-13 gang, allegations he denies.

Earlier this week, Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a motion before district Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the criminal smuggling charges against him, calling them vindictive and political.

Abrego Garcia was born in El Salvador but had been living in Maryland, after entering the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16. According to court documents, he was escaping gang death threats in his native country. He ended up living in Maryland, where his brother lives. There, Abrego Garcia met and married his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and is raising three kids with her.

He was deported in March back to his home country and immediately imprisoned there, despite a 2019 court order blocking his removal there. His attorneys say he had permission to work in the U.S.

Administration officials now argue that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he crossed into the U.S. illegally and an immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not back to his native El Salvador.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes of Tennessee, in a lengthy opinion in June, questioned the merits of the smuggling claims, saying the government's accusations of how many alleged smuggling trips he took ""approach physical impossibility.""

His lawyers in a court filing wrote that the smuggling charges amounted to ""the government's concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2F25%2F923444c94beaaaaeff3aa1840bd6%2Fvan-hollen-garcia.jfif,N,,2025-08-22 18:56:58.015769

Community members confronted federal agents outside a home, as they attempted to make arrests.

Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora responded to the area and explained what happened.

""Because they were not able to effectuate a warrant, they chased the person to the house from a couple blocks over and there was a standoff in the street and behind their house,"" said Gusciora.

Human rights advocates and concerned community members were refused information about the family’s presence at the facility, according to the report.
In many cases immigrants were deported to situations that were unsafe, which is another human rights violation called ""refoulement.""
Venezuela and El Salvador would later hold a prison swap freeing the more than 200 men.
There are likely more cases than the 16 included in the Center for Human Rights’ report, Godoy said.","The University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights is warning that federal immigration action has crossed a new boundary and is now breaking international humanitarian law.

The report zeroes in on 16 cases where people have been arrested by government agents and held for extended periods of time without access to a lawyer, or to the outside world. The legal term for such detentions is “enforced disappearance.”

“What I'm talking about is cases where days or even weeks go by that families still don't know where their loved one is,” said Center for Human Rights Director Angelina Godoy.

All of the cases covered in the center’s report have connections to Washington state. The people involved were either Washington residents, they were held at federal facilities in the state, or they were deported through Tacoma’s ICE immigrant lockup.

“The level of secrecy is what's different in these cases,” Godoy said.

The report highlights two families who were held in Customs and Border Patrol custody at different facilities in Washington state.

One family of asylum seekers from Africa was held for 24 days at the Ferndale Customs and Border Patrol office in Whatcom County. During their detention, family members were not allowed to make phone calls. Human rights advocates and concerned community members were refused information about the family’s presence at the facility, according to the report.

The other family was split up. While visiting family from Canada at Peace Arch Park on the U.S.-Canada border, a woman from Honduras and her U.S. citizen children were taken into Customs and Border Patrol custody in Ferndale. Meanwhile, her husband was arrested in Portland and held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. They were held for an estimated two weeks without the ability to contact lawyers and obtain legal help.

“The case raises obvious concerns about forced disappearance,” the report said. “The family did not appear in the ICE Locator, they appear to have been moved to avoid detection.”

Most of what the report called forced disappearances are people deported to third countries, some to a prison in El Salvador in violation of a federal court order.

In addition to the two families, the report focuses on 14 cases where people were either sent to an immigrant lockup in Guantanamo Bay, the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo in El Salvador (the Terrorism Confinement Center) also known as CECOT, or to a third country.

In many cases immigrants were deported to situations that were unsafe, which is another human rights violation called ""refoulement.""

At least seven men either lived or passed through Washington state who were held in CECOT in El Salvador. They joined more than 200 other Venezuelan nationals who faced abuse and torture at the center, including allegedly being shot at with rubber bullets.

According to a report from Propublica, the Trump administration knew more than half of the over 200 Venezuelan deportees held in CECOT had no criminal record, and had only violated immigration laws. Venezuela and El Salvador would later hold a prison swap freeing the more than 200 men.

“Although their return to Venezuela is a positive development, it does not erase the responsibility of the U.S. government, GEO Group, King County, Signature Aviation, and Global X for their roles in transporting prisoners to a site where their disappearance and torture was a foreseeable outcome,” the report states.

There are likely more cases than the 16 included in the Center for Human Rights’ report, Godoy said.

She acknowledged that local and state governments cannot actively prevent the federal government from enforcing immigration laws.

But Godoy suggested that people who are concerned about the violations documented in the report should get creative about how to best protect people in their communities and how to respond to human rights abuses they witness or hear about.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/69791b28e67bcd4bf3e0a54bca0dcf68.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:45.108047

ICE agents can make arrests only in “extremely specific circumstances,” Chan said.","Federal agents arrested a protester outside the San Francisco immigration court on Wednesday and charged the protester with two federal misdemeanors: Destruction of property and assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer.

Bay Area attorneys say this is the first time they can remember Department of Homeland Security authorities filing such charges filed against a citizen in San Francisco. While protesters have been charged by federal agents in Los Angeles, moving the practice north is a sign of “escalation,” said Angela Chan, the city’s assistant chief public defender.

The protester, a U.S. citizen who asked to be identified by her first name, Angélica, was arrested around 10 a.m. yesterday during a chaotic street scene: Video showed ICE agents tackling several protesters to the ground after a crowd tried to stop ICE from transporting an asylum-seeker whom agents had arrested that morning.

Angélica, a trans woman from an immigrant family, was one of those filmed being zip-tied and led away, her head wrapped in a keffiyeh and held down by officers. Angélica was brought into the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters at 630 Sansome St. without a cellphone, her partner, Renee, said.

A day passed before her family heard from Angélica again.

Holding a citizen at an ICE building is “unheard of,” Chan said. Earlier this month, ICE agents detained two protesters in downtown San Francisco for the first time in recent memory.

Supporters spent the rest of Wednesday checking the inmate logs of every jail in the area, Renee said, trying to find Angélica. The gym Angélica works at in Oakland closed to let her co-workers join the search. One supporter reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office.

Around midnight, Renee said, Angélica’s name finally appeared on a list of people held at Santa Rita jail in Alameda County. Angélica told family members that there was no access to a phone or an attorney in the holding cell.

Angélica said the sheriff’s deputies appeared confused: They did not seem to know what to do with someone brought over by federal agents.

At 7 a.m. on Thursday, Angélica’s name disappeared from the Santa Rita logs, Renee said. Two hours later, Angélica’s supporters learned that she was scheduled to appear at the federal courthouse at 450 Golden Gate Ave. at 10:30 a.m.

Unlike most defendants who are arrested on federal charges, Angélica was never in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, and was brought to Santa Rita instead by officers with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE. ICE officers also took Angélica to federal court.

Angélica, a born and raised San Franciscan, was represented by federal public defender Samantha Jaffe, who declined to comment. U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim ordered Angélica be released until a pending court date in September.

ICE agents can make arrests only in “extremely specific circumstances,” Chan said. “They must witness a federal felony offense in front of them while engaging in immigration-related enforcement and have completed requisite training.”

Angélica has been ordered to stay away from the immigration courts at 100 Montgomery St. and 630 Sansome St. Federal prosecutors had requested an order to keep Angélica from all federal buildings and officers, Renee said, but Judge Kim noted that this would be impractical — Angélica has to attend her own hearings, after all, and federal agents aren’t always visible.

Her case has caused an outcry among labor, immigrant, queer and trans community groups.

“SEIU 1021 members were outraged to learn that Angélica, a U.S. citizen and the child of one of our own members, was violently arrested by ICE in San Francisco while exercising her First Amendment rights,” wrote Theresa Rutherford, the president of the service employees’ union.

Renee said that Angélica was “standing up for all the things the mayor says he supports, but has been silent on.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-0820-10.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:57:30.947286

His administration's cuts to USAID have been linked to starvation deaths and criticized internationally.

The author contrasts Trump's record with previous Nobel Peace Prize winners, who were focused on human rights and humanitarian work.

Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize. I do not know why, unless it’s because former President Barack Obama has one and Trump’s apparent jealousy toward his predecessor has again reared its ugly head.

I would be surprised if the committee of Norwegians who select the Peace Prize honoree would choose Trump, who, by even the most favorable of characterizations, is a divisive bully. But if I have learned anything in our topsy-turvy political era, it is that anything is possible.

Meanwhile, Trump and his minions are shamelessly campaigning for the honor, typically announced in October. Trump even told Norway’s finance minister he wanted the prize in a discussion about tariffs, according to a Norwegian business daily.

The national media is having a field day speculating about Trump’s chances. As parlor games go, I guess there are worse ones.

But as for the reasons I think the event is unlikely … well, where to start?

Trump aid cuts have led to starvation deaths

The first thing to know is that Trump’s actions, which are controversial in the U.S., are judged even more harshly abroad.

One of the first major acts of his second term has been to kill the U.S. Agency for International Development, breaking commitments to more than 100 nations and cutting in midstream funding to humanitarian efforts that served millions of people. Nonprofits on the ground say the abrupt cuts to food aid in places such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria has directly caused children's death from malnourishment. We learned last month the U.S. State Department will incinerate 500 tons of food initially intended to feed starving people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Too many Americans either don’t know, don’t care or have already forgotten these unnecessary cruelties. However, the Peace Prize committee that, by definition, must consider international affairs, would very much know what happened.

Abusive immigration enforcement presents ugly U.S. image

Trump’s treatment of immigrants, too, can’t have gone unnoticed by people in other countries. After all, it has affected those nations’ expatriates living in the U.S. as well as their citizens who get into trouble with immigration enforcement while just vacationing. Several countries have issued travel advisories for the U.S., an uncommon move, and the U.S. is the only country where tourism declined from the same point last year.

Videos from some of the immigration arrests show a pattern of abuse, and Trump’s administration has gone far beyond its stated goal of only going after the worst criminals. We have seen teachers, veterans, students, business owners, landscapers, farm workers, police officers, medical workers and plenty of other regular folk arrested by masked men and often, taken off of their (tax-paying) jobs.

Many of the immigrants have lived here peacefully for years, even decades, and are pillars of their community. A number of those arrested are here legally, or held documentation that was just fine before Trump’s team changed the rules. Now we learn that the administration plans to plumb the backgrounds of all 55 million U.S. visa holders, looking for reasons to expel people from our country.

How might all this look to a foreign Peace Prize committee?

‘Peace’ in Ukraine and Gaza? Not at all.

Trump and his peons’ chief claim that Trump should win the prize is that he has negotiated six (or seven, depending on who is doing the spin that day) peace deals. This dubious claim has been challenged.

He most wants credit for are his alleged peacekeeping skills in the Israeli-Gaza conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war — thus he took part in separate meetings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accompanied by other European leaders, to attempt progress on the latter.

The meetings yielded no tangible results, which itself highlights why these two conflicts are not exactly strong parts of Trump’s peacekeeping resume: Neither is in any way resolved, and people are dying regularly in both. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is currently preparing plans to take over and occupy Gaza, where famine has been declared, while Putin continues drone strikes against Ukraine's civilian populace. In both situations, these Trump allies are taking advantage of Trump's agnosticism on how “peace” is achieved.

One of these is not like the others

A glance at the list of past Nobel Peace Prize laureates is made up of a bunch of people who don’t sound anything like Trump. Recent winners include Narges Mohammadi of Iran, who champions women's rights; Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, a fighter for human rights and democracy; Maria Ressa of the Philippines, an advocate for press freedom; and the World Food Programme, which, like the name sounds, provides food to the hungry.

Compare that to Trump, whose resume is like a mirror image reverse of the people just mentioned. His resume includes felony convictions in a case where he paid hush money to a porn star and an adjudicated sexual assault of another woman, who he also defamed. His use of the federal government to target people with whom he disagrees and his lies about the 2020 election are among examples of his clear and present danger to free speech and democracy. He considers the free press an enemy. His actions toward USAID and support for Congress' ""big beautiful bill, which cuts food benefits — that speaks to where he is on hunger.

I would wager that Trump and his cultists would dismiss nearly all laureates on the list as hopelessly “woke” — even as Trump seeks to join their number.

Does the world want more Trumpism?

If we are being honest, the only reason a committee would award the prize to Trump would be to encourage him or appease him in some way — perhaps under the belief it will lead to changes in a selfish man who by most accounts has changed little from back when he was a racially discriminatory landlord in New York City in the 1970s.

Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in the first year of his first term. At the time it was believed by many that it was Europe’s way to illustrate to the world the kind of thoughtful, broad-minded America the world wanted, a notion the Peace Prize committee strongly hinted at when it said Obama had spurred a “new climate” in international relations.

I can’t imagine the America Trump represents is what the rest of the world wants to see more of.

But again, anything’s possible.

How to address the DACA population will be among the more immediate decisions confronting state policymakers, given the August 25 effective date, absent injunctive relief in California v. Kennedy.
Strategic Considerations for the Plaintiffs Given the constraint imposed by Trump v. CASA, the plaintiffs in California v. Kennedy may consider one or more of the following strategies: Seek Class Certification.
Conclusion California v. Kennedy presents a significant test case not only for the legality of HHS’s Proposed Rule but also for the federal judiciary’s evolving role in administrative oversight after Trump v. CASA.
As the plaintiffs state, ”The result of the implementation of the Final Rule’s provisions is that millions of Americans will lose health coverage.","On July 17, 2025, the State of California joined by 20 states, including New York,1 as well as advocacy organizations,2 filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts against US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and other federal officials and agencies.3 The plaintiffs in the case, California v. Kennedy, are seeking injunctive relief (a court order requiring a party to either take or not take a specific action) to block the implementation of a finalized federal rule, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Marketplace Integrity and Affordability (hereafter referred to as the Rule. That Rule will otherwise go into effect August 25, 2025, nationwide and significantly alter key regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Central to this litigation is the legality of the and what power and scope the courts have to limit federal agency rules Trump v. CASA.4

The Rule imposes a series of restrictions on coverage under the ACA that HHS estimates will result in up to 1.8 million enrollees losing coverage nationally in plan year 2026.5 Changes to coverage from the Rule are expected to most directly impact the roughly 226,000 New Yorkers who are enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the NY State of Health (NYSOH)—New York’s state-based ACA marketplace. Through NYSOH, New Yorkers can receive federal tax credits that help reduce their premium payments on a sliding scale up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).6 Certain changes are likely to impact New Yorkers who have health coverage through their employer as well. However, because New York is both a state that has expanded Medicaid coverage eligibility under the ACA and currently operates a Basic Health Plan option, known as the Essential Plan, individuals with incomes up to 250 percent FPL in New York should be less significantly impacted.

In addition to analysis from both the Rockefeller Institute7 and others regarding various federal health policy changes, as well as broader analysis8 about the Rule itself, we recently posted a separate summary of the Rule focused particularly on the impact for New York.9 This blog discusses the arguments raised in California v. Kennedy and how the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA may constrain the Massachusetts federal district court’s authority to issue nationwide injunctive relief.

Changes to coverage from the Rule are expected to most directly impact the roughly 226,000 New Yorkers who are enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the NY State of Health (NYSOH)—New York’s state-based ACA marketplace.

The ACA and HHS Rule

Enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) created sweeping reforms in the private health insurance market, including the creation of health insurance exchanges,10 advance premium tax credits, and protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.11 In addition to the ACA, subsequent companion federal regulations12 have filled in critical administrative details, governing everything from eligibility verification to enrollment timing and grace periods for lapsed coverage.

As noted above, the Rule at issue in California v. Kennedy is discussed in more detail in other analyses, including one by the Rockefeller Institute.13 In summary, the Rule includes both permanent and temporary effects and changes for impacted health plan enrollees.

Permanent Effects14 Temporary Effects15 (only for 2026 plan year) Fewer benefits Significant new paperwork verification requirements such as presenting original paperwork as proof of tax and citizenship instead of the current automated verification process More expensive coverage Newly allowing insurers to deny coverage for past-due premiums Shorter enrollment periods Adopting a $5 monthly premium payment for certain enrollees who are currently eligible for a $0 premium Limiting automatic re-enrollment for certain enrollees Requiring the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to verify eligibility for new special enrollment period (SEP) enrollments Eliminating coverage for certain deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) individuals Prohibiting coverage of gender-affirming care

The Rule includes provisions that were struck from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) by the Senate parliamentarian before it was passed because the provisions did not comply with the rules for passing a budget reconciliation bill with a simple majority. 16 The Rule, therefore, essentially allows the Trump administration to accomplish a similar result through different means (regulation). Because rulemaking is generally easier to modify than statute, however, the Rule’s provisions could be modified by a future administration without consent from Congress.

Arguments by Plaintiff States and Defendant Federal Government

Arguments by Plaintiff States

California and its 20 co-plaintiffs, including New York, have raised multiple statutory and constitutional claims challenging the Rule. Chief among them are:

Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs contend that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious under provisions of the federal APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)), which establishes a standard for federal agencies to follow when creating rules and making decisions. Plaintiffs contend that HHS failed to adequately consider the interests of states and enrollees, did not provide sufficient evidentiary support for the need to change existing rules, and failed to account for adverse impacts on low-income populations. Plaintiffs have also argued that HHS did not provide sufficient time for public comment—only 23 days instead of the typical 30-day period.

Contravention of the ACA. Plaintiffs argue that the Rule contradicts express provisions of the ACA, including statutory definitions of “minimum essential coverage” and congressional intent to broaden—not restrict—access to health insurance.

Federalism and Tenth Amendment Concerns. Several plaintiff states further assert that the Rule unlawfully interferes with their state-administered Medicaid and Basic Health Programs by altering eligibility standards and coverage definitions in ways that exceed HHS’s statutory authority.17

In particular, plaintiffs have raised six grounds, or causes of action, in their request for relief to the federal District Court. In the first cause of action, plaintiffs contend that the 23-day comment period was inadequate under the Administrative Procedures Act, which they assert should have provided at least 30 days.

The second cause of action is the most detailed, alleging that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. In essence, plaintiffs contend that HHS failed to provide adequate reasons for numerous changes in the Rule, nor did they meaningfully respond to comments about those proposed changes as required under the APA. In particular, plaintiffs cite the following changes, noting the lack of sufficient rationale by HHS for each:

the $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees with no premium under ACA tax credits;

the shortened annual open enrollment period during which individuals are able to sign up for coverage;

requirements for states using the Federal Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to conduct certain eligibility verification for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP), which allows enrollment outside the annual open enrollment period for individuals with life-changing events such as loss of employment, divorce, birth of a child;

revocation of the guaranteed issuance of coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, allowing insurers to deny enrollment for failure to pay premiums in the past; and

revisions to the ranges for actuarial value (the overall value of benefit coverage afforded to an average population with that plan), which allow insurers to lower the value of the benefits provided.

In the third cause of action, plaintiffs argue that exclusion of coverage for gender affirming care as a benefit for the required minimum level of comprehensive coverage—known as the Essential Health Benefits (EHB)—is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.

In the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, plaintiffs contend that HHS acted in excess of the statutory authority granted by Congress, also in violation of the APA. The plaintiffs focus on two provisions in the Rule. First, plaintiffs argue that the $5 premium penalty on re-enrollees who have no premiums under the ACA violates the ACA, and that Congress gave HHS no authority to institute such a premium penalty. Further, plaintiffs note that, under the ACA, HHS must make certain that the scope of mandatory benefits (called “Essential Health Benefits” or EHB) is determined by a survey of employer-sponsored coverage, and HHS failed to do this when barring coverage of gender dysphoria treatment for EHB. Here, the plaintiffs cite case law noting that an executive agency “has no power to act… unless and until Congress confers power upon it”.

Arguments by HHS

In opposition, HHS has argued against any preliminary order by the court on the grounds that the plaintiff states are not likely to succeed at the end of the day. HHS contends that it gave enough notice under the APA, counting the time HHS posted the proposed Rule on the agency’s website days before the proposed Rule was officially published in the Federal Register. Similar to published comments on the Rule, HHS broadly justified the Rule as necessary to prevent fraud, reduce improper payments, and ensure program integrity18—a lens through which many of the recent health-related federal policy changes have been framed by Congress and the Trump administration. In this case, HHS has suggested the Rule is needed at least in substantial part to address a perceived improper enrollment problem. As to the exclusion of EHB coverage for gender-affirming care, HHS addressed its failure to conduct the ACA-required survey by contending that its original survey, when EHB standards were first adopted after the ACA was enacted, is enough, and further surveying should not be required for specific changes regarding particular benefits. In addition, HHS relies on the fact that many other states have selected EHB plans that do not include coverage of gender-affirming care. With regard to DACA coverage, HHS argues that the change is necessary given the immigration policies of Congress and the Trump administration.

The plaintiffs are requesting a preliminary and permanent injunction to halt the implementation of the Rule nationwide. This is where Trump v. CASA is important, as the application of injunctive relief may be limited following the Supreme Court’s decision in that case.

The Supreme Court’s Decision in Trump v. CASA

Decided in June 2025, the decision in Trump v. CASA reshapes the landscape of injunctive relief issued by federal district courts. In a 6–3 decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that federal district courts lack authority to issue universal (nationwide) injunctions absent a specific statutory grant or authorization to do so vis-à-vis a law enacted by a legislative body. In its decision, the Court emphasized that the customary ability of courts to order someone to do (or stop doing) something is generally applicable to parties to the lawsuit under Article III19 of the US Constitution. The Court further warned against federal courts overreaching in a way that effectively transforms individual cases into legislative vetoes, a power constitutionally granted to the president. The decision formally overturned a series of lower court precedents that had permitted nationwide injunctions in Administrative Procedures Act (APA) cases. The majority held that even where a rule is facially invalid, meaning it cannot be enforced constitutionally under any circumstances, under the APA, district courts must limit their orders to addressing the injuries of the parties before them. Writing for the dissent, Justice Sotomayor expressed concern for a “patchwork of legality” where some jurisdictions are bound by invalid regulations while others are not, undermining the uniform application of federal law.20

In light of Trump v. CASA, the Massachusetts district court will need to carefully tailor any injunctive relief it grants in California v. Kennedy. As a result, several implications follow:

No Nationwide Injunction. Even if the court agrees with the plaintiffs that the Proposed Rule is unlawful under the APA, Trump v. CASA precludes it from ordering HHS to stop the Rule’s application to nonparty states or entities. Any such court injunction is likely to extend only to the named plaintiffs—California, New York, and the other plaintiff states and organizations.

Geographic Fragmentation. The decision could lead to a scenario where the Proposed Rule is blocked in plaintiff states but enforced elsewhere, resulting in uneven access to ACA benefits and compliance burdens for insurers operating across state lines. This raises complex questions about the operational feasibility of the Rule, especially for national insurers and multistate exchanges. For example, the DACA change could cost New York approximately $80 million annually, should the state provide equivalent care to the DACA population, raising new questions to those already posed by the OBBBA for New York lawmakers regarding coverage for noncitizens. The DACA population is the subject of a related federal case, Kansas v. United States, brought by Republican states challenging a Biden-era rule related to DACA coverage. If the Rule is implemented, the Kansas v. United States case will be unnecessary. How to address the DACA population will be among the more immediate decisions confronting state policymakers, given the August 25 effective date, absent injunctive relief in California v. Kennedy.

Increased Role for Appellate Courts and Inter-Circuit Conflicts. Because no single district court can block the Rule nationwide, the case is likely to become part of a broader litigation mosaic. Other states may file parallel suits in other districts, and eventual resolution may come only through the appellate courts or the Supreme Court.

Enforcement and Administrative Discretion. Even within the plaintiff states, the scope of relief may be contested. For example, the district court may order HHS not to enforce the Rule only as it applies to state agencies or residents enrolled in certain programs. HHS may respond with guidance or “selective enforcement” policies designed to mitigate the disruption—though such moves could themselves become legally contentious. How the District Court will handle the administrative discretion will be instructive. In another relatively recent decision, Loper Bright v. Raimondo,21 the US Supreme Court overruled a longstanding legal doctrine under which federal courts afforded broad discretion to federal agencies. The Loper decision requires federal courts to use their independent judgment in deciding whether a federal agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency’s interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.

Strategic Considerations for the Plaintiffs

Given the constraint imposed by Trump v. CASA, the plaintiffs in California v. Kennedy may consider one or more of the following strategies:

Seek Class Certification. By certifying a nationwide class of affected individuals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, plaintiffs may attempt to achieve functionally broad relief while staying within the bounds of party-specific adjudication established by the decision in Trump v. CASA.

Rely on APA § 706(2) Arguments. Plaintiffs may argue that invalidating the Proposed Rule under the APA naturally compels vacatur—whereby the court vacates or sets aside a regulation, effectively removing or voiding its legal force—as a remedy that applies nationally. However, Trump v. CASA suggests that courts must distinguish between vacatur and injunction, potentially limiting even APA-based remedies to plaintiff-specific outcomes.

Coordinate Parallel Litigation. Blue states and advocacy groups not party to this case may file copycat suits in sympathetic jurisdictions, aiming to build a critical mass of adverse rulings that compel HHS to withdraw or revise the Rule.

Appellate Review. If relief is denied or limited, plaintiffs may seek review by the First Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court, potentially testing the outer limits of Trump v. CASA in the context of nationwide programs like the ACA.

Conclusion

California v. Kennedy presents a significant test case not only for the legality of HHS’s Proposed Rule but also for the federal judiciary’s evolving role in administrative oversight after Trump v. CASA. While plaintiffs have some substantive arguments under the APA and ACA, the Supreme Court’s recent curtailment of nationwide injunctions will likely restrict the Massachusetts district court’s ability to provide sweeping national relief.

Interestingly, some states that are most impacted by the Rule are not party to the case and, therefore, are unlikely to benefit from potential injunctive relief. Nevertheless, New York and other plaintiff states have a greater likelihood of being awarded injunctive relief for the portions of the Rule most applicable to New York, should the district court decide in the plaintiffs’ favor. These components include: fewer benefits, shortened open enrollment periods, increased premiums and out-of-pocket costs for consumers, stricter documentation requirements, limits on DACA enrollment, and the coverage of gender-affirming care. These changes will result in loss of coverage, new costs to the state, and the potential for increased costs to purchase less coverage, among other things.

HHS’s decision to provide flexibility to the 13 state-based exchanges and New York’s unique coverage options, such as the Basic Health Plan, automatically creates a dichotomy in application between states. In addition, the limitations on judicial action outlined in the CASA ruling may result in the California v. Kennedy decision further exacerbating differences in a uniform application of marketplace rules, potentially undermining the intent of the ACA. Therefore, this case underscores the emerging tension between the need for uniform regulatory rules in national programs like the ACA and the judiciary’s increasingly fragmented capacity to adjudicate administrative disputes. Unless Congress amends the APA or the Supreme Court revisits its stance, the path forward for challengers to federal rules will require creative litigation strategies. The Rockefeller Institute of Government will continue to monitor key developments as this and other cases unfold with respect to their impacts on the healthcare of New Yorkers.

4 According to a University of Michigan, Michigan Law analysis, “In its June 27 decision in Trump v. CASA, the US Supreme Court limited the scope of federal courts to block presidential policies nationwide. The issue before the justices was whether federal courts in three cases could issue universal injunctions against President Trump’s Executive Order 14160 limiting birthright citizenship. The majority opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not address the merits of the birthright citizenship order.”

5 HHS estimates a reduction in marketplace coverage between 725 million (lower bound) to 1.8 billion (upper bound) individuals. HHS details the complexity in estimating the impact of the Rule here, but in short, they note that they believe a significant amount of the impact is concentrated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah, where they believe there were “improper enrollments.”

9 The Rockefeller Institute of Government is closely monitoring activity at the federal level that could have implications for New York. In addition to enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), summarized in a recent blog post, the Trump administration has taken administrative actions that have additional impacts to New York, which have also been summarized in our recent policy brief.

10 Sixteen states, including New York, operate a state-based health insurance exchange. In New York, the health insurance exchange is called New York State of Health.

11 According to HHS, a preexisting condition is: “A health problem, like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, you had before the date that new health coverage starts. Insurance companies can’t refuse to cover treatment for your pre-existing condition or charge you more.”

12 There are many federal regulations implementing the ACA from multiple agencies. Some of the core regulations were promulgated by HHS in 45 CRF Parts 155 and 156 (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/06/04/2013-13149/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-establishment-of-exchanges-and-qualified-health-plans; https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-B/part-156?toc=1 ).

As the plaintiffs state, ”The result of the implementation of the Final Rule’s provisions is that millions of Americans will lose health coverage. Those who maintain coverage will pay higher premiums for diminished coverage and will spend more on out-of-pocket costs to use that coverage (in the form of co-pays and deductibles). And when these newly uninsured individuals need healthcare—as everyone eventually will—the States will bear the cost. State and local governments will pay for the dramatic increase in uncompensated care costs for individuals who become uninsured as a result of the Final Rule. State Medicaid expenditures will balloon as people who lose their subsidized marketplace coverage will turn to publicly funded healthcare as a backstop. And States will lose tax revenue derived from insurance premiums no longer paid by those who have dropped or lost coverage as a result of these changes.” (Complaint, at paragraph 243, page 70-71).

That is the largest two-year increase in more than 30 years of our estimates. The 14 million figure is also a new high, though preliminary data shows the population likely continued to grow and peaked in 2024.

In this Q&A, we speak with Senior Demographer Jeffrey S. Passel about how the Center estimates the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

How does Pew Research Center define ‘unauthorized immigrants’?

Unauthorized immigrants are those who are not members of any of the groups the U.S. has approved for legal immigration: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum and legal temporary migrants (e.g., foreign students).

The term “unauthorized immigrants” combines immigrants whose status is impermanent, precarious or both. For example, many unauthorized immigrants entered the country illegally. Others entered legally with a work or tourist visa but stayed longer than allowed. And others entered the U.S. legally with a temporary, precarious status.

Though the term isn’t perfect, it’s been used for decades by researchers to estimate the size of this population and is generally preferred over terms like “undocumented immigrant” or “illegal immigrant.”

Why is it important to know how many unauthorized immigrants are in the country?

Unauthorized immigrants make up about 4% of the U.S. population. It’s important to have a sense of their number, who they are and what their roles are in the economy when government policies affect them. Our estimates help provide insight into these factors, as well as how their population size has changed over time, where they’re from, where they live in the U.S. and how long they’ve been here.

One example of what we can learn from these estimates is that many U.S. families include both unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens. About 12 million people who are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants live in households with at least one unauthorized immigrant.

How do unauthorized immigrants enter the country?

As mentioned earlier, unauthorized immigrants enter the country in different ways. For many years, there were two main categories of unauthorized immigrants:

People who enter the U.S. illegally

People who enter the U.S. legally but overstay their visa or otherwise violate the terms of their admission

Historically, the majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country illegally. The share who had overstayed visas grew in the 2010s.

In recent years, a third, but smaller, category of unauthorized immigrants has emerged as the federal government has created new programs:

People who enter the U.S. legally with temporary protection from deportation that the government can revoke if immigration policy shifts

This third group includes migrants from certain countries facing war, natural disasters or other crises, as well as individuals who are paroled or released at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2023, about 2 million of the 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country had been admitted into the U.S. with precarious statuses.

Why is someone who was given permission to come to the United States or to live and work here considered an unauthorized immigrant?

In recent years, an increasing number of immigrants have had temporary statuses that protect them from deportation. They are grouped as unauthorized immigrants because their statuses can be revoked, sometimes quickly, by the president or Congress.

The Trump administration has revoked the protections of many unauthorized immigrants this year. More than 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were paroled into the U.S. between October 2022 and November 2024 had their temporary protection removed and work permits invalidated in 2025. The administration also allowed Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program protections to expire for 350,000 Venezuelans and 350,000 Haitians.

How many immigrants had these protections in 2023?

In 2023, more than 40% of unauthorized immigrants had some protection from deportation – about 6 million of our estimated 14 million total. This figure is up significantly from 500,000 (or 4% of the total) in 2007 and 2.7 million in 2021.

Protected groups include:

Asylum applicants (2.6 million in 2023)

Immigrants who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole (700,000)

Victims of crimes or violence (700,000)

Those with TPS (650,000)

Enrollees in Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children (600,000)

Migrants who the U.S. Border Patrol released into the U.S. (1.0 million)

How did you estimate the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States?

Conceptually, our method for estimating the size of this population is fairly straightforward.

Estimate the number of immigrants who are in the country legally.

Use data from a national survey or census to estimate the total number of immigrants (legal and unauthorized) living in the country.

Subtract the number of legal immigrants from the total.

Our methodology includes many more details and refinements, but the basic calculation comes from this simple relationship.

Data for the total immigrant population comes from national Census Bureau surveys that ask respondents where they were born. (They do not ask about immigration status.) These surveys have large samples and have been conducted for many years.

Annual data on the number of people admitted to the U.S. as legal permanent residents (also called LPRs or green card holders), refugees or people granted asylum is available mainly from the Department of Homeland Security. So counting this group is more straightforward than trying to count the number of unauthorized immigrants directly. We use the annual totals to estimate the current population of immigrants in the country legally, after accounting for deaths and departures.

In December 2024, the Census Bureau changed its U.S. population estimates, acknowledging much larger immigration flows than it had previously measured. Has this affected your estimates?

Yes. Since 2005, the American Community Survey (ACS) has provided the data we use to estimate the total number of immigrants living in the U.S. The population figures (or survey weights in the ACS) rely on another Census Bureau program that provides national and state-level population estimates each year.

Population estimates are released every December for the current year and all years since the most recent decennial census. Sometimes the bureau also changes the method for its estimates. It did that for its estimates released in December 2024, which covered 2021-24.

The new estimates changed how the bureau measured net international immigration in a major way. The updated national population estimates for 2023 included about 2 million more immigrants than the previous methodology had indicated. Almost all of those additional immigrants were unauthorized immigrants who had arrived since 2021.

Though the bureau updated its U.S. population estimates for 2022 and 2023, it did not retroactively adjust its surveys for those years or for the weights we use to estimate the number of immigrants. That means the data the bureau had previously released for those years is not consistent with its newer, better estimates.

For our new estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population, we reweighted the data for the 2022 and 2023 ACS so the estimates are comparable across years and align with the newer data on international migration. As a result, we revised our estimate of the unauthorized immigrant population for 2022 upward, from 11.0 million to 11.8 million.

Why are your most recent estimates from 2023? Isn’t there data for 2024 and 2025?

While there is some data for 2024 and 2025 that can shed light on trends in the unauthorized immigrant population, it’s less comprehensive and complete.

The ACS, our main data source, is not released until September and October of the year following the survey. As a result, the most recent ACS data we currently have is for 2023.

The Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS) is a more timely source, as it comes out monthly. But its scope is much more limited, and it samples only about 3% as many people as the ACS. That greatly limits its usefulness for estimating the size of the unauthorized immigrant population.

Nonetheless, CPS data and other federal sources can provide limited information about possible trends and changes in the total immigrant and unauthorized immigrant populations:

For 2024, administrative data on arrivals of immigrants and CPS data on trends in the total immigrant population point to continued growth in the unauthorized immigrant population through the early part of the year. In the last half of 2024, that growth likely slowed.

For 2025, monthly CPS data shows that the total immigrant population decreased by June, which implies that the unauthorized immigrant population did as well.

While we can’t definitively estimate the size of the unauthorized immigrant population from this data, the trends suggest that the unauthorized immigrant population was probably larger in mid-2025 than in 2023.

Can I calculate the number of unauthorized immigrants for 2024 and 2025 by adding the number of people that Border Patrol reported coming into the U.S. to your estimates?

No. It is correct that the people Border Patrol “releases” or “paroles” into the U.S. do count as unauthorized immigrants. However, adding these counts to our estimates will result in inaccurate totals because this does not account for other ways that the number of unauthorized immigrants can change.

Historically, the number of unauthorized immigrants has been very dynamic. The number can increase as more people enter the U.S. without authorization, overstay visas or are paroled into the country. It can also decrease as immigrants:

Leave the U.S., either voluntarily or through deportation

Die

Become an LPR or get asylum

From 2007 through 2019, the number of unauthorized immigrants decreased by more than 2 million as more people left than entered the unauthorized immigrant population. On the other hand, it increased by nearly 4 million from 2019 through 2023.

How do you ensure your estimates are accurate?

We’ve changed our methodology over the years as more and better data has become available. Both parts of our estimate – the number of legal immigrants and the number of total immigrants – are based on data from reliable sources.

We also adjust our estimates to account for immigrants, both legal and unauthorized, who are missed in the national surveys. We use Census Bureau studies of undercount to make these adjustments.

We also use other data sources to assess the accuracy of our estimates, including data on birth rates and death rates as well as surveys and censuses in other countries. For example, Mexico, which accounts for the largest number of unauthorized immigrants to the U.S., has its own census and surveys that give us a better idea of how many unauthorized immigrants from Mexico we might be missing. We can then apply what we learn to the broader unauthorized immigrant population.

Finally, the ACS can be compared with the CPS, a smaller but more timely Census Bureau survey, to check the comparability of our estimates.",https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/SR_25.08.22_immigration-q-and-a_featured.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-08-22 19:57:11.575307

“The fundamental provisions as to the protection of Caymanians and their society have always continued in the legislation.","Cayman Islands’ immigration and employment problems could be solved by enforcing existing laws rather than passing new ones, says a leading immigration lawyer.

Nick Joseph of Reside Cayman has worked in immigration law in Cayman for 15 years and said he was worried that “history was being rewritten” by government plans to bring back the Caymanian Protection Act.

Enforcing laws

“The law was never fundamentally changed. My perception is that we just stopped following it,” Joseph said.

“We didn’t get rid of the Caymanian Protection Law,” he added. “The fundamental provisions as to the protection of Caymanians and their society have always continued in the legislation. We just renamed the law…the real question is, why haven’t we been consistently applying the law?”

The coalition government’s plan to bring back the Caymanian Protection Act was outlined by Caymanian Employment and Immigration Minister Michael Myles at the 100 days in office celebration on 15 Aug.

“We’re going back to the Caymanian Protection Act,” Myles said. “The goal is that Caymanians have to be protected. Fifty years ago, we had a legislation that protected Caymanians. We’ve gotten rid of it because we turned immigration into a bank. It can’t be that. It has to still be a protection for people and a screening instrument to protect our way of life.”

But Joseph said that the problem was not a lack of legislation, but the failure to enforce it.

“What has happened is it appears that for the last 15 years is that we’ve acted as if the Caymanian Protection Law was no longer the law of the Cayman Islands – but it was, and for half a century, always has been,” he said.

“The damage that that has caused in the society is manifest: the abject reframing of our culture and the displacement of Caymanians from appropriate participation in aspects of our economy and even from geographic areas of our community has seemingly been allowed to happen in breach of our laws.”

He added, “The fundamental problem is not that we did away with … the Caymanian Protection Law; it’s because we stopped enforcing it.”

Joseph suggested that a problem might be the way government is structured.

“There’s a lot of very hard working, very competent civil servants, but if they’re working in silos, there needs to be more joined up thinking,” he said. “Everybody in the civil service knows that there’s a jigsaw puzzle that needs to be put together, but it can appear each one of them is working on their own piece, without regard to how it’s going to fit with the one next door.”

Joseph added, “Maybe this is where the laws need to be rewritten, and that the pyramids of control need to be more directly assigned to somebody. So, for example, you can’t have WORC in one silo and Customs and Border Control in a different silo, and Business Licensing in a different silo…because they all have to intersect and join up perfectly with one another and run like a single well-oiled machine.”

The issue of enforcement was raised by Minister Myles during the 100 days event when outlining plans for immigration reform.

“We need to do [immigration reform] in phases and then we need to make sure that people are comfortable with what that first phase is and then putting the enforcement in place,” he said.

“Because just understand, we are a country of laws. We don’t enforce many of them. We have to be able to enforce the laws. So part of the first phase is looking at how we enforce it.”

Myles said on a Facebook post on Thursday that he was proud to take “swift action” on immigration.

“Our current immigration, labour and pension laws and processes are not as protective or sustainable for Caymanians as they need to be and our NCFC coalition is committed to Caymanians first,” he wrote.

“That does not mean Caymanians only. We will not fix decades of ineffective immigration policy with one bill. NCFC is committed to a multi-faced approach and the approach will be balanced overall but to get to the right balance some changes will need to move significantly more towards protecting Caymanians.”

The hospitality industry in particular was singled out by Myles for needing to employ more Caymanians rather than recruiting from overseas and making sure that local workers were being offered the same salaries as expats.

Hermes Cuello, general manager of the Grand Cayman Marriott Resort, said, “The hiring of local talent and having Caymanians in the front lines has been always our objective in our industry and we have been highlighted as one of those model hotels in that aspect.”

He said the Marriott would continue to work on identifying local talent and that it had extensive internship programmes at the hotel and worked closely with the Department of Labour.

He added, “We know that to source every single employee in a hotel locally is extremely difficult, but we need to make more efforts to bring as many Caymanians as possible as well, and that’s our main objective.”

But in June, the Trump administration rolled back a policy that shielded SIJS recipients from being removed from the country.
Once that court order is received, applicants are eligible to file for the special status before they turn 21.
In fiscal year 2016, there were 142 petitions for the special status.
For now, Regina said she is holding out hope to one day receive her green card as she files for the special status.","In Regina’s bedroom, there’s a collection of shoes – about 26, she counted – lined up neatly beneath her bed. There’s a bookshelf tucked away in a corner filled with spines that read Jane Austen and Sylvia Plath, and there’s a whole lot of pink. As she likes to put it, it’s a “girly mess.”

Regina, 19, is one of hundreds of migrant youth in Connecticut who are applying for permanent legal residency through a special juvenile immigration program.

“They say a lot of the times when you aren't able to express yourself when you're little and have a lot of toys, you grow up to have a lot of toys, and that's definitely me,” Regina said.

Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) is a classification available under the federal immigration system for migrants under 21 who have been abused, neglected or abandoned by a parent. It gives many a chance to escape harrowing situations and live legally in the United States.

For Regina, expressing herself in her own space is healing after living a tumultuous childhood in her home country, Mexico, where she endured physical abuse and neglect from her mother.

Young migrants with SIJS have been afforded protection from deportation in the past while they wait for their green card. Regina hopes the status will give her more stability in the years ahead.

But in June, the Trump administration rolled back a policy that shielded SIJS recipients from being removed from the country. She and others could now face deportation, even after documenting the harm they were exposed to by parents.

“I think about all the horrible things these kids have been through,” Regina said. “All the challenges they had to go through, and trauma, to be here… to be at a safe place and then be slapped in the face for wanting to release their dreams. It's so beyond words.”

Growing up in Mexico

Regina’s memories of Mexico involve a lot of moving around. She was born there and lived mostly with her mother and younger brother while her father was living and working in New England.

Connecticut Public is identifying Regina by her first name for her and her family’s safety.

Growing up, Regina said her mother constantly neglected her. At one point, she said, her mother left her and her younger brother home alone for five consecutive days.

Connecticut Public reviewed reports submitted to the probate court by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF) that detailed some of the abuse, including the probate court study and a family case plan.

According to the reports, a DCF social worker determined Regina’s mother was “not an appropriate support or caretaker” because of abuse and neglect.

Regina’s mother “would allegedly beat Regina daily and due to bouts of depression would subject both [children] to lack of food and supervision,” the social worker wrote.

“She wasn’t ever at home. She never took care of us,” Regina said. “To me, it felt like it didn't matter whether we lived or died.”

Regina recalls moments where as a child, she’d climb up onto the kitchen counter with the help of her brother to reach the cereal and milk so they could eat.

“It was a lot of fending for yourself and going about it the way you know how to go about it,” she said.

Oftentimes, Regina said, family members or her mother’s friends would take care of her and her brother. Being home with her mother was also challenging.

“I don't remember my earliest memory with her,” Regina said, speaking about her mom. “I just remember getting yelled at and being hit.”

The DCF report details the alleged abuse through Regina’s testimony, stating that Regina’s mother would beat Regina daily by hitting her with objects, pinching her, clawing her arms, and bruising her.

“I kept thinking this to myself, I was like, next time she hits me, I'm moving with my dad. Next time she hits me, I'm calling my dad,” Regina said. “Every time she hit me, it'd be like, the next time she does it, I'm actually gonna tell her I want to leave. Every single time.”

Regina eventually came to live with her father in Connecticut when she was around 10.

The social worker who reviewed her case determined it isn’t possible to reunite Regina with her mother because of an absence of a parent-child relationship, and because Regina didn’t feel safe with her.

Regina said she and her father tried to find ways to get legal immigration status once she decided to stay in the US with him, but at every consultation with an immigration attorney, they were told they had no good options and turned away.

However, last year, she learned about SIJS from immigration attorney Erin O’Neil, who practices in East Hartford. Regina started the process, and recently reached an important milestone, receiving orders from a probate court judge that grant her father sole guardianship over Regina, and certify her case is eligible to move forward.

What is Special Immigrant Juvenile Status?

Congress created the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status classification in 1990. Those who receive it can become legal permanent residents.

Most people filing for SIJS are in the country without legal status. While a small number may have entered with a visa, the majority have crossed the border without inspection, according to O’Neil.

Before someone can apply, they must first obtain a state court order. In Connecticut, the court order comes after an investigation into the alleged abuse, which is typically conducted by DCF. A state probate judge then reviews the evidence, hears testimony and decides whether the findings support granting an order.

Once that court order is received, applicants are eligible to file for the special status before they turn 21. Officials from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) review the court order and ensure the SIJS classification isn’t primarily being sought to obtain an immigration benefit. If they approve, applicants are then eligible to apply for a green card.

However, most face a long wait. The green card application can't be filed until an immigrant visa is available, a condition that can delay the process by four years or more.

Because of the long wait times, the Biden administration in 2022 implemented a policy that protected SIJS recipients from deportation by automatically granting most deferred action and authorization to work.

But in June, USCIS rolled back the policy, announcing it would no longer automatically consider granting deferred action to new SIJS recipients. The protection remains in place for those who already have it, though federal officials can revoke it at their discretion, and it may expire before a visa becomes available.

Criticisms of the program

The policy change comes amid criticism from the Trump administration that migrants are exploiting the program.

Petitions for SIJS have surged since 2022, both nationwide and in Connecticut.

Nationally, petitions for SIJS went from around 22,000 in fiscal year 2017 to about 68,000 in fiscal year 2024, according to a USCIS report on the program.

Connecticut’s probate courts have seen a similar spike. In fiscal year 2016, there were 142 petitions for the special status. By fiscal year 2024, that number grew to 1,730.

The increase was particularly sharp in recent years. In fiscal year 2022, the period when the Biden-era policy was enacted, there were 783 petitions, and in the following fiscal year the number of petitions jumped to 1,423, according to data provided by the Office of the Probate Court Administrator.

Records show courts in Stamford, Danbury and New Haven recently saw the highest volume of special immigrant juvenile cases, receiving more than 200 petitions each in a single year.

Last month, federal immigration authorities released a report detailing alleged abuses of the program.

It highlighted the drastic increase in petitions and raised concerns about age and identity fraud and false claims of parental maltreatment. USCIS said it also identified 853 known or suspected gang members who filed for SIJS.

“This report exposes how the open border lobby and activist judges are exploiting loopholes in the name of aiding helpless children,” USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a written statement.

The report also pointed out that more than half of applicants are over the age of 18, implying that the program is not helping the children it’s meant to.

“Right now, this program is growing way farther than it should have been allowed to and allowing people to take advantage of this visa for purposes that are far from the cases of abused kids,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington D.C. think tank that advocates for less immigration.

“They're just using it to get a green card when they wouldn't otherwise qualify in any other way,” Vaughan said.

But O’Neil, Regina’s immigration lawyer, disagrees. She said SIJS cases are thoroughly vetted by an independent state court.

“It's not something that's forged,” O’Neil said. “It's not something that's made up.""

Maegan Faitsch, an attorney who works with SIJS applicants at Connecticut Legal Services, said she was discouraged by the report. She said most of her clients are unaware of the program before she meets them.

“I'm sure that there are people that have used the program in a way that it was not set out for, but I think that in my mind, that does not mean that the program should not exist,” Faitsch said. “It means that there should be qualified attorneys helping people access the program.”

David Marantz, an attorney of child protection, juvenile law and criminal practice in Stamford, acknowledges some of the issues described in the report. He said he believes the availability of special juvenile status encourages some migrants to enter the country, exposing them to potential safety risks on their journey to cross the border.

“You know, that's a double-edged sword,” Marantz said. “You feel for people, you want to help them, but it also sends out the word to encourage more of it.”

However, Marantz said most clients who seek his help with SIJS petitions have valid claims.

""They seem extremely legitimate,"" he said, ""and I don't think it's an abuse of the process that I've seen very often. And really, at this point, over the years, I've handled quite a few cases, and I really don't see that.""

What's next for SIJS?

A pending federal lawsuit challenges the Trump administration’s policy changes to SIJS.

Attorneys representing migrant children filed the suit in the Eastern District of New York, according to The Associated Press. The plaintiffs are asking a federal judge to restore these children’s deportation protections.

For now, Regina said she is holding out hope to one day receive her green card as she files for the special status. She hopes other migrant youth in Connecticut who have faced abuse and neglect will do the same.

“That's something that I want to pass on,” Regina said. “You can do things because you have gotten this far. You can do things even if you're doing them scared.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5559923/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7391x3880+0+523/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F85%2F6bd3617b47dda36455ce98277dc1%2F250725regina-mma2387.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:34.472662

Grants for Disfavored Research,"Adam Liptak, www.nytimes.com, adam-liptak",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/supreme-court-nih-grants.html,"But a different five-justice majority let stand for now a lower court’s ruling that the administration’s underlying policy directing the cuts was probably unlawful and should be put on hold.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Barrett wrote that challenges to individual grant terminations had probably been filed in the wrong court.
But she said the challenge to the policy guidance had been filed in the correct court.
The forbidden research topics, the challengers said, were ill-defined and the policy of canceling grants inconsistently applied.
The case was similar to one from April in which the Supreme Court allowed the administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, but the N.I.H.","In a fractured ruling, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled by a 5-to-4 vote that the Trump administration could for now cancel more than $780 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health that the government said had been intended to explore topics like diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, “gender ideology” and vaccine hesitancy.

But a different five-justice majority let stand for now a lower court’s ruling that the administration’s underlying policy directing the cuts was probably unlawful and should be put on hold.

Only Justice Amy Coney Barrett was in both majorities.

The court’s order is not the last word, and the case will proceed in lower courts. The upshot of the scrambled ruling, subject to ongoing litigation, appears to be that grants already canceled will not be immediately reinstated but that recipients may be able to sue in a specialized court. Further cancellations may be barred.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Barrett wrote that challenges to individual grant terminations had probably been filed in the wrong court. But she said the challenge to the policy guidance had been filed in the correct court.

Still, she added, “whether claims about the guidance in this case will succeed is another question” but the lower court judge’s ruling could remain in place for now.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — would have blocked the policy and also restored the funding. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh would have allowed the Trump policy and the cuts to be implemented.

The mixed result was a break from the administration’s recent winning streak at the Supreme Court.

After the N.I.H. sent out boilerplate notices terminating thousands of grants, research and advocacy groups, a union, individual researchers and 16 states sued, saying the moves were arbitrary and capricious.

The forbidden research topics, the challengers said, were ill-defined and the policy of canceling grants inconsistently applied. The practical impact, they added, was devastating.

“To take just one example,” lawyers for the states told the justices, “defendants’ terminations forced the University of Massachusetts’ medical school to lay off or furlough 209 employees and to cut the incoming fall 2025 graduate class by 86 percent, from 70 students to 10.”

Judge William G. Young of the Federal District Court of Massachusetts ruled for the challengers in July, saying that the administration had justified its actions with “sparse pseudo-reasoning and wholly unsupported statements.”

For example, Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said there was “not a shred of evidence” to support the administration’s position that D.E.I. studies are “often used in support of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics.”

A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, refused to pause Judge Young’s ruling while it considered the government’s appeal. Writing for the panel, Judge Julie Rikelman, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said it appeared that the terminations would set back lifesaving research by years, if not decades.

The case was similar to one from April in which the Supreme Court allowed the administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, but the N.I.H. case involves far more money. The April vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice Roberts dissenting along with the three-member liberal bloc.

Since then, the administration has prevailed in a large majority of its roughly 20 emergency applications arising from its blitz of executive orders, often with only liberal justices issuing public dissents.

In its emergency application in the N.I.H. case, the government said that the case was legally identical to the April case and that federal trial judges’ defiance of that ruling “has grown to epidemic proportions.”

The challengers said the two cases were different, partly because the earlier one concerned individual contracts rather than an overall policy. That was the issue that divided the justices.

In a page-long partial dissent, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the policy guidance and its consequences were legally inseparable and so the funding should be restored. Judge Young, the chief justice wrote, was not required to split the case into two parts.

The court’s three liberal members joined his opinion.

Justice Jackson added her own 16-page opinion writing only for herself. She drew on the comic strip “Calvin and Hobbes,” which features the game of Calvinball.

“This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Justice Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/00dc-scotus-NIH-wjtv/00dc-scotus-NIH-wjtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:49.924885

“It’s challenging if you have someone who is trying to block you from being able to get something done that I have legally every right to bring to the council,” Cervantes said.","About a month after a series of immigration sweeps took place in Los Angeles earlier this summer, a video posted to social media July 9 showed federal agents conducting an operation near a Home Depot between Madison Street and Indiana Avenue in Riverside.

In the video, masked U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations agents were seen detaining multiple individuals and placing them in the back of unmarked vehicles.

Riverside Councilmember Clarissa Cervantes, who is currently running for State Assembly, denounced the raid in a social media post later that day and announced plans to create a resolution requiring immigration agents to provide identification while conducting operations within the city.

“It really felt like that was a situation that was giving the kidnapping kind of essence,” Cervantes told The Riverside Record. “No one knew who these people were. They refused to say what agency they were with.”

Since then, Cervantes and her team have been working with local immigration rights groups to finalize the draft resolution, with plans to bring it to the city council early next month.

Natalia Saka, the Inland Empire’s regional policy advocate for the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), spoke in support of the proposed resolution at the August 5 meeting.

“By not placing this item on the agenda, the council misses a chance to strengthen public safety and trust,” Saka said. “When immigration agents don’t identify themselves, it undermines trust between residents and local police.”

In an email to The Record, CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas said that requiring clear identifications of agents “prevents vigilantes or those working outside the law from usurping the role of federal agents,” and would alleviate one of the community’s biggest concerns.

The current draft, Cervantes said, contains language reaffirming the city’s commitment to its immigrant community and provides statistics on the impacts of immigration enforcement operations on its residents before offering a variety of actions that the council could take, including condemning masked federal agents using with unmarked vehicles and requiring them to provide badge numbers and names.

Other city and state lawmakers across Southern California have taken a similar approach. State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez (D-Pasadena) announced in late June the “No Vigilantes Act,” a bill aimed at requiring agents to provide identification. Days after her announcement, the city of Huntington Park passed a similar resolution after local police arrested an individual impersonating a Border Patrol agent.

Cervantes said her resolution would also direct the city attorney’s office to document instances in which immigration agents might have violated a person’s civil rights while detaining them and asks the city council to consider creating a legal aid fund meant to support residents impacted by immigration operations.

Cervantes also said she planned to ask the city council, during closed session, to discuss joining other municipalities in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In July, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order as part of the suit that blocked immigration agents from conducting raids in several California counties, including Riverside, unless there was reasonable suspicion other than factors like ethnicity or presence in certain locations.

“Our hope is to really make it clear, again, where we are as a city and our values,” Cervantes said. “But also that, if people are concerned about who is showing up and arresting, that [the Riverside Police Department] will respond and they will do, to the best of their ability, to identify the agents.”

The department declined to comment on the potential resolution.

Cervantes said she previously attempted to get the draft resolution on a council agenda earlier this month, but received pushback from Councilmember Chuck Conder.

“It’s challenging if you have someone who is trying to block you from being able to get something done that I have legally every right to bring to the council,” Cervantes said.

Conder declined a request for comment.

Home Office to appeal against high court's Epping hotel ruling

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said.

Jarvis has said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex.

He told broadcasters:

This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government.

We’ve made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. And that’s why we’ll appeal this decision.

Here is a summary from today’s blog:

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said. Jarvis said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex.

On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas. Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”.

Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning, saying that the court ruling was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.

The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said. He accused the government of not “listening to the public or to the courts”.

Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”. Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City.

Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.

Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting tensions over the issue. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with more expected on Saturday.

Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds.

The Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats in two separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley Wood, Claygate, and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the Addlestone seat in yesterday’s byelections.

Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the party and will sit as an independent. In his resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish Conservatives had “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a “positive, proactive agenda for real change” had been rejected. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: “We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well.”

Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian. Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers.

GMB has urged the government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel after assuming control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told BBC Breakfast that recent developments show why public ownership or greater government control is needed. Separately, the mayor of South Yorkshire said the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a conclusion should not be rushed.

Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds, Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK politics”.

Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.

Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister.

Ministers have announced a clampdown on people who continue to claim child benefit payments even though they have moved abroad, in measures that could save the taxpayer £350m over five years. The government said 2,600 people who had left the UK but still claimed the benefit had already been removed from the welfare system.

Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair having worked closely together in the past.

A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration. Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained.

Civil servants in a government department are to strike in a dispute over office closures, recruitment and attendance policies. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike from 2 to 25 September.

Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels. Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year.

Closing asylum hotels must be 'orderly', says Cooper as government plans to appeal against Epping hotel court ruling

Closing asylum hotels must be “orderly” rather than through “piecemeal court decisions”, the home secretary has said as the government plans to appeal against a court ruling blocking the use of an Epping hotel.

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to then further appeal against the temporary injunction.

On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas, reports the PA news agency.

Cooper said:

We agree with communities across the country that all asylum hotels need to close, including the Bell hotel, and we are working to do so as swiftly as possible as part of an orderly, planned and sustained programme that avoids simply creating problems for other areas or local councils as a result of piecemeal court decisions or a return to the kind of chaos which led to so many hotels being opened in the first place.

That is the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local councils.

Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”.

'Utterly horrifying': Lammy accuses Israeli government of causing 'man-made catastrophe' as famine declared in Gaza City

Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”, reports the PA news agency.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said on Friday that famine is occurring in Gaza City and could spread farther south. It comes after weeks of warnings by aid groups that restrictions on aid were leading to starvation among Palestinians.

In a statement on Friday afternoon, Lammy said:

The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable.

The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.

The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children.

The government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them.

It is the first time that the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East. The IPC report said that more than half a million people in Gaza face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes.

Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. He added:

The UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas.

We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans. This terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.

According to the PA news agency, Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, has hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning that asylum hotels must be closed “in a properly managed way”.

She said the row was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.

Whitbread warned that waiting until the end of parliament to close hotels was “too long”, adding:

Our community can’t afford to wait another four years.

She said the protests had already caused “a huge amount of disruption” and argued the hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was “untenable” and unsafe for both residents and the wider Epping community.

Anti-immigrant protesters face off with counter-demonstrators in Portsmouth

Dozens of immigration protesters have faced off with anti-racism demonstrators in Portsmouth.

According to the PA news agency Rita, a Portsmouth resident who joined the Stand Up to Racism counter-protest said:

I feel ashamed [at the protest] and I say this as a white British elderly lady who has been spat upon, verbally abused and had things thrown at me, just for being on this side of the road.

I am angry that my Christianity is being used as a weapon by the right and to be used in the name of fascism.

The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said.

According to the PA news agency, he said:

The Epping Bell hotel injunction has been a victory for local people, led by a Conservative council working hard for their community. This is the difference Conservatives in local government deliver.

In opposition, Labour worked hand-in-glove with activist lawyers to sabotage Conservative immigration plans. In government, nothing has changed.

It is completely wrong that the Labour government is taking legal action to keep open the Bell hotel. The Government isn’t listening to the public or to the courts.

Instead of trying to keep illegal immigrants in expensive hotels, the Conservatives would remove all illegal arrivals, put in place a real deterrent and ensure towns like Epping are never put in this position again.

A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration, reports the PA news agency.

Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained. She said:

I think we can be pretty confident that we will end up with a fragmented parliament where there is not a single party majority.

We will have a parliament of minorities – nothing new in that – but I think we will have a parliament of minorities that may find it more difficult to work across party lines. Partly because of the nature of relationships that have emerged over recent years, and we have seen an increasing polarisation among the parties.

Prof McEwen is a professor of public policy and governance at the University of Glasgow, director of the Centre for Public Policy, and senior fellow at the UK In A Changing Europe thinktank. She leads research on devolution and inter-institutional relations and provides advice to governments and public bodies.

According to the PA news agency, Prof McEwen advised that relationships across parties and between the UK and Scottish governments need to be prioritised in order for Holyrood to be able to successfully deliver on policies. She said:

Even if there was a majority government – there won’t be, but even if there was – the Scottish government cannot deliver things alone. It tends to set the framework and relies a lot on delivery partners, and a very big partner in that is local government.

There’s the relationship between the Scottish government and UK government. It’s an area I’ve done quite a lot of research on over the years, and the relationship particularly before the general election was dire.

That’s a problem, because it really matters … There are so many areas of policy that are still reserved, but they have an impact on the responsibilities of this parliament.

She added:

Managing that relationship has to be a priority for any administration in Scotland. That has been better since the last election since the change of government, but there are still challenges and still issues.

Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year.

The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister, with the increasing failure rate leading to education experts describing it as a “crisis” that was damaging students’ mental health and future prospects. The government is expected to revise the policy as part of its national curriculum review anticipated to be published later this year.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said:

It is important that if a young person leaves school not having achieved a grade 4 in English and maths, they continue to study it, so that they can achieve that qualification.

Having a GCSE in English and maths transforms life chances of young people, including their health and employment prospects … if you think about what’s happened since 2014 when that policy was introduced by the Conservatives, every year 30,000 more young people over the age of 16 are getting that qualification.

Gibb’s defence of the policy comes as the front pages of both the Times and Telegraph today drew attention to the likelihood of the policy being scrapped.

Catherine Sezen, director of education policy for the Association of Colleges, said:

We must also reflect on the experience of over 130,000 students who did not reach that [grade 4] benchmark. Across the country, educators are working hard to improve outcomes, yet many are left asking what more can be done.

After a decade of the condition of funding policy, it is time to rethink how we support young people to build essential English and maths skills.

Government gives baby food firms 18 months to improve quality of products in England

David Batty

Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor.

The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.

It also requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims that make baby foods seem healthier than they are.

This will cover products with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.

It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food that failed to meet the needs of infants.

A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, published in April, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.

The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said:

They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.

The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often “bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.

Prof Simon Kenny, NHS England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said:

These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.

Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”

Fears grow over impact of ONS data reliability on Rachel Reeves’s budget

Anna Isaac

Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian.

Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers.

Such is the concern that insiders at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believe it may have to again highlight “significant uncertainty” in its forecasts because of poor official data, as it did publicly in March. Economists have also warned that the problems risk the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”.

The OBR forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the headroom the chancellor has against her self-imposed fiscal rules, and form the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government needs to help fund public services.

The ONS, which produces figures on a range of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling with mounting problems as it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases.

Its labour force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns.

The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One said:

We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the jobs market.

They added that while other datasets might offer indications of the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role of the LFS.

David Lammy among 21 foreign ministers to condemn plan for illegal West Bank settlement

Kiran Stacey

David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure.

The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.

Officials then summoned Tzipi Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public rebuke for the Israeli ambassador. The actions marked a further intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and the West Bank.

The statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said:

The decision by the Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.

In a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a statement.

It did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for comment.

There has been some reaction to the news that MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see 9.13am BST). Balfour is the second MSP to leave the party in recent months, after Jamie Greene quit the Tories in April and joined the Liberal Democrats.

According to the PA news agency, Greene said of Balfour’s resignation:

I was clear back in April when I quit the Tories that it was a most unhappy of ships and others would follow my exit. Whilst Jeremy and I disagreed on specific issues over the years, I respect people who hold views which are clearly borne from life experiences and beliefs, as mine are.

One wonders how many more former colleagues will come to their senses and quit.

SNP MSP George Adam said:

The Scottish Conservatives under Russell Findlay’s disastrous leadership have completely fallen apart.

It is welcome to see Jeremy Balfour come to his senses on the reality of the Tories in Scotland, as they become increasingly extreme to pander to the politics of Nigel Farage.

With yet another MSP ditching the party, it’s clear the Tories are in freefall in Scotland as we approach the 2026 election. The only question remaining is who’ll be next to desert the sinking ship?

Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said:

When even a social conservative like Jeremy Balfour is saying you are too reactionary, it is time to reconsider your politics.

Government to cover pay and pensions at collapsed South Yorkshire steelworks

Jasper Jolly

Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company.

Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds.

The judge approved an application by the government’s official receiver, a representative tasked with winding up insolvent companies, to appoint special managers from the advisory company Teneo. A Teneo senior managing director was present in court on Thursday, and made contact with Liberty Steel executives immediately after the hearing.

Concerned union leaders representing SSUK’s 1,450 workers met the special managers last night, seeking assurances particularly on pay and pensions, as well as when operations could restart at sites including Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, after a year without work.

Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the biggest steelworking union, said that he had “received firm assurances” on pay and pensions.

The court heard on Thursday that SSUK had only £650,000 left in its bank account, with the August payroll of £3.6m due on Friday. Gupta’s counsel had argued that he was ready to cover the payments via another company, Liberty Capital UK, although the judge, Mr Justice Mellor, said Gupta’s assurances that he could pay “are at best questionable”.

The special managers have committed that workers will receive their August pay packets before the bank holiday weekend. They also said that they will fill in unpaid employer pension contributions for the past year. That will remove a major source of concern for workers, who had feared losing national insurance protections next month if the company were to close.

It remains unclear when the plants will restart production, although a person briefed on the talks said that the special managers had given positive signals that it could happen soon. Restarting production and trying to generate cash after four years in which it lost £340m will be crucial to limiting the costs of the administration, which will be borne temporarily by the government.

Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels, reports the PA news agency.

Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year.

The east of Scotland has experienced greater water scarcity than the rest of the country, with average reservoir levels down 1% to 57% this week – 24% below the average of 81% for this time of year.

Scottish Water said demand has increased by 100m litres per day.

The supplier has asked the public to take small precautions to save water when possible, such as using watering cans instead of garden hoses, taking shorter showers, and turning off the tap when brushing teeth. Washing machines and dishwashers should only be used when fully loaded, and buckets and sponges should be used to wash cars rather than a hose, it added.

Scots use an average of 178 litres of water per day, Scottish Water said, which is higher than in England and Wales where people use an average of 137 litres per person per day, reports the PA news agency.

John Griffen, Scottish Water’s water operations general manager, said:

We’re working hard to maintain normal supplies for all customers and would ask that they use water efficiently to protect this precious resource. We believe that a large part of the additional water use at the moment is in gardens so we would ask that customers are mindful of how much water they use there.

Any rainfall we have had in parts of the country recently has not been prolonged enough to help our resources recover from the long spells of dry weather we have had recently and earlier this year. With no significant rain forecast for the next week or more, it’s important that everyone helps.

Scottish Water is now considering the possibility of bringing in water from alternative sources at its Backwater and Loch of Lintrathen reservoirs, which serve the Dundee and Tayside areas.

In the West Linton area of the Scottish Borders, Baddinsgill and West Water reservoirs – which serve much of West Lothian – are at 50% and 40%, and Scottish Water is balancing the flows between both sources. The company is also using tankers to supplement normal water supplies in some parts of the country.

Commenting on the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks, the general secretary of Community union said the “government’s intervention must mark a turning point to deliver certainty” for the businesses.

Roy Rickhuss said in a statement that “jobs must be protected” and wages should be paid as well as outstanding pensions contributions being secured. He added:

We welcome the government’s intervention which is yet another demonstration of our Labour government’s commitment to delivering for steelworkers and our vital foundation industry.

However, in taking control of the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account.

(AP) — At an obstacle course in the humid Georgia heat, an instructor shows recruits how to pull a wounded partner out of danger. In a classroom with desks cluttered with thick legal books about immigration law, recruits learn about how the Fourth Amendment governs their work. And on a firing range littered with shell casings, new recruits for Immigration and Customs Enforcement practice shooting their handguns.

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump’s mass deportation goal. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They’re hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they’re hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour’s drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don’t know what might be coming at them.

“We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,” said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,” he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.”

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone’s house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can’t — and don’t — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2230972796-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 16:56:54.299130

document says that the funds apportioned are for PEPFAR but also “Global Health security, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Polio eradication and prevention.” PEPFAR funding appropriated from Congress is earmarked strictly for H.I.V.","The Trump administration is ignoring a directive from Congress and refusing to fully fund a landmark H.I.V. program that is widely credited with saving millions of lives over the past two decades.

The Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell T. Vought, has apportioned only $2.9 billion of $6 billion appropriated by Congress for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in the 2025 fiscal year spending bill, according to budget documents and members of the program’s staff.

PEPFAR, as the program is known, was created in 2003, during the George W. Bush administration, to provide funding for H.I.V. prevention and treatment to low-income countries. It has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support and is often cited as the most effective public health campaign ever, credited with saving an estimated 26 million lives.

In July, the Trump administration withdrew a proposed $400 million rescission from PEPFAR’s budget in the face of bipartisan Senate opposition. But that fight was a distraction, according to staff members who work on the program, because, they said, they have repeatedly been told by Mr. Vought’s budget office that the program would be receiving only about half of the $6 billion appropriated by Congress for the 2025 fiscal year, even with that $400 million restored.

That cut is visible in budget documents that appear on a federal website tracking the activity of the White House Office of Management and Budget. The Trump administration took that website offline in January, but it was restored late last week after a court order.

Whether the executive branch can withhold money appropriated by Congress has been a focus of a number of legal battles since the President Trump took office vowing to slash government spending and terminate many foreign aid programs.

The decision not to release the PEPFAR funds is in keeping with Mr. Vought’s stated belief that the executive branch can use the budget office forcibly to shrink the size of government. He has so far faced limited resistance from Congress although some members have accused him of impoundment.

The Impoundment Control Act restricts how a president can withhold funds appropriated by Congress. It was passed in 1974 to give Congress greater control over the budget in response to the impoundment practices of President Richard M. Nixon.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Vought’s office said that further financial allocations were awaiting a planning document and that those funds could be disbursed through 2029.

PEPFAR funds are normally appropriated by Congress in five-year cycles but allocated to the program each year. At this point in previous years, PEPFAR’s funding had been allocated in full, according to veteran staff members at the program, to allow for planning for disbursement of those resources.

The amount the O.M.B. has released for the 2025 fiscal year roughly aligns with the budget proposal the Trump administration sent to Congress in May for 2026 — $2.9 billion — offering a possible clue to Mr. Vought’s view on how much money the program should have.

William Hoagland, an expert on federal budgets with the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, said the failure to apportion the 2025 funds appeared to be a deliberate slow-walk. The effect was preventing PEPFAR from using the money and creating a justification for a much bigger rescission, said Mr. Hoagland, who was once a top aide to the former Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee.

A footnote on the O.M.B. document outlines a multistep process in which the PEPFAR leadership would need to submit a spending plan for this fiscal year (of which less than six weeks remain), the O.M.B. would revise that plan, and there would be further back-and-forth consultation. It requests that the submission include “a detailed description of how such spending plan aligns with Administration priorities.”

If Congress does not intervene, the funds will have been effectively cut, as the period for their use has passed, Mr. Hoagland said.

“Then Vought has achieved the goal that he wanted, which was to reduce funding for PEPFAR,” he said.

The withholding of PEPFAR funds is eroding H.I.V. programs that have relied on the program’s support to operate. While many have had to close completely since the Trump administration began to curtail foreign aid with an Inauguration Day executive order, others were continuing to operate on a reduced budget.

Lifesaving H.I.V. programs were covered by a waiver that allowed them to resume operations.

But now some are being told to pare back their budgets, on a scale that mirrors the amount of money being withheld.

Dr. Pasquine Ogunsanya, the director of a large H.I.V. program in Uganda, said that this month her organization had received money only for salaries and limited administrative costs, and that there was no budget for services such as delivering medications to bedridden patients or admitting critically ill individuals to the clinic.

She said she had been told this week that her program’s budget would shrink by a further 40 percent. “I’m just thinking how can we do that, I’m having sleepless nights,” she said. “How can we have five people providing lifesaving H.I.V. services to 10,000 clients?”

The administration has criticized global health programs as frequently bloated and wasteful, and argued that the countries that received the aid should do more to help their citizens. It has also urged other organizations and high-income countries to do more.

As part of the administration’s effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, it has terminated H.I.V. care for gay and transgender people. H.I.V. prevention programs for high-risk groups — such as sex workers and injecting drug users — have been cut and only pregnant and breastfeeding women can now receive U.S.-funded prevention drugs or condoms.

“O.M.B. is blocking funding for PEPFAR,” said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “Congress rejected O.M.B.’s proposed $400 million rescission in PEPFAR funding, yet none of these funds have been obligated to program. PEPFAR funds are simply not reaching those in need, as confirmed by those in the field.”

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, called the failure to appropriate the PEPFAR funds a de facto funding cut. “Even after promising Republican lawmakers that the program would be protected, Russ Vought has choked off a huge chunk of funding provided by Congress for PEPFAR,” she said. “And he’s managed to hide this cut from lawmakers and the public until now because he took down a key spending transparency website.”

Internal documents from the State Department show that the person approving these documents is Amarallyis Fox Kennedy, identified as the “Program Associate Director for Intelligence and International Affairs Programs.” Ms. Fox Kennedy is the daughter-in-law of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and was reported to have helped broker his endorsement of President Trump. She did not respond to requests for comment on her role in supervising the PEPFAR budget.

Staff members in the new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy at the State Department, which now oversees PEPFAR, described verbal directives from the O.M.B. in which they were told that the maximum amount that they would be given would be $2.9 billion, and that they should make plans with implementing partners accordingly. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

Another footnote on the O.M.B. document says that the funds apportioned are for PEPFAR but also “Global Health security, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Polio eradication and prevention.”

PEPFAR funding appropriated from Congress is earmarked strictly for H.I.V. programs; other global health activities have a separate funding stream.

The chokehold on funding comes at the same time that senior staff members are drafting a plan, at the direction of the State Department, to shut PEPFAR down, cutting some countries off in as little as two years and shuttering the whole program within eight.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/xx-pepfar-funding-01-flkw/xx-pepfar-funding-01-flkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 16:56:37.295240

Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine.
But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years.
“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.
“If every person paying attention to the TV, the radio, the internet is only told that migrants are ‘bad, bad, bad,’ if they only show bad places and bad people, of course, that’s what people are going to think,” he said.","The immigrant worker from Uzbekistan entered the bank in Moscow, but when he reached the teller, she refused to serve him and she wouldn’t say why.

For him and others from impoverished countries across Central Asia who seek better lives in Russia, such hostility is woven into everyday life. Sometimes it bursts into outright violence.

“Mostly you notice it when you go to the hospital, a clinic, a government office: You stand in line and everyone shoots you dirty looks,” said the man, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions.

Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, over 20% of Russian businesses said they were hindered by a lack of workers, according to the Central Bank.

But rather than welcoming laborers, Russian officials are fomenting anti-migrant sentiment and increasing restrictions on immigrants, which the government says number 6.1 million, but is probably higher. The government is tracking their movement, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children’s rights to education.

A massacre and a backlash

The continued crackdown comes as a trial began this month for four Tajik nationals who are accused of the shooting and arson attack at a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 149 people. The four were arrested within hours of the attack and appeared in court with signs of being severely beaten. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility but Russia sought to blame Ukraine for the bloodshed.

Anti-migrant rhetoric had been growing in Russia since the early 2020s. But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years. In the eight days after the killings, she received 700 reports of injuries to immigrants, including “faces smashed against the doors of police stations,” she said.

Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin captured the public mood after the massacre, saying “migration control is extremely important” to ensure foreign nationals carrying out “illegal activity” could be deported without a court order.

The violence drew concern from human rights groups.

“Central Asian migrants seeking work in Russia due to dire economic conditions in their countries of origin today face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and other harassment by police in Russia,” Human Rights Watch said in a report on the anniversary of the attack.

“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.

Raids, roundups and restrictions

While some violence has subsided, it hasn’t disappeared. In April, police raided a Kyrgyz-run bathhouse in Moscow with video showing masked men forcing half-naked bathers to crawl across the floor and deliberately stepping on them before covering the lens of a security camera.

Police also reportedly rounded up immigrants in raids on warehouses, construction sites and mosques, then coerced them into joining the military to fight in Ukraine. Some are threatened with having their residency documents withheld, while others are recently naturalized citizens who failed to register for military service. In such cases, serving in the military is presented as the only alternative to prison or deportation. For others, a fast track to Russian citizenship is offered as an incentive for enlisting.

Speaking in St. Petersburg in May, Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, said “20,000 ‘young’ citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan (and) Kyrgyzstan” were serving in Ukraine.

Those immigrants who have avoided violence still are subject to new anti-migrant laws. Much of this is targeted specifically toward workers from Central Asia.

In 2024, 13 Russian regions banned immigrants from certain jobs, including in hospitality, catering and finance, and even as taxi drivers. A pilot program starting in September in the Moscow region requires migrants who enter Russia without a visa to be tracked via an app. Those failing to comply are added to a police watchlist, impeding access to services like banking, and subjecting them to a possible cutoff of cellphone and internet connectivity.

A nationwide law banned children of immigrants from attending school unless they could prove they could speak Russian. Less than six weeks after the law came into force, officials told local media that only 19% of children who applied for the language test were able to take it, and the most common reason for rejection was incomplete or inaccurate documents.

Another man from Uzbekistan who has worked in Russia for almost two decades and lives in St. Petersburg said he’s had to wait in line for over seven hours to get needed residency documents. The man, who also spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, hopes to stay in Russia but says the climate has worsened.

“It’s hard to get paperwork,” he said. “There just isn’t the time.”

The oppressive laws sometimes force immigrants to resort to paying bribes. Chupik, the lawyer, believes that Russia’s system results in “violations that cannot be avoided.”

“This is exactly what this mass regulation is striving for: not for all migrants to be here legally, but for everyone to be illegal,” she said. “That way, they can extract bribes from anyone at any moment and deport anyone who resists.”

Encouraging anti-migrant sentiment

Anti-migrant sentiment is unlikely to diminish anytime soon, mostly because it’s encouraged by authorities like the Investigative Committee’s Bastrykin, who said immigrants “physically occupy our territory, not just with their ideology but with specific buildings” — referring to sites such as mosques.

Ultra-nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said foreign workers “behave aggressively, causing conflicts and potentially dangerous situations.”

Migrants are an easy scapegoat for many social ills, and not just in Russia, said Caress Schenk, an associate professor of political science at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan.

“Closing borders, conducting migrant raids and tightening policies are all tools that are easy go-tos for politicians the world over,” she said. “It goes in cycles that are sensitive to geopolitical pressures, as we’re seeing now, but also things like election campaigns and domestic political rivalries.”

A surge of “anti-migrant propaganda” has dwarfed previous rhetoric of recent years, according to the Moscow-based Uzbek immigrant who was ignored by the bank teller.

“If every person paying attention to the TV, the radio, the internet is only told that migrants are ‘bad, bad, bad,’ if they only show bad places and bad people, of course, that’s what people are going to think,” he said.

Such anti-migrant rhetoric has become part of the nationalist narrative from President Vladimir Putin and others used to justify the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — that Russia is under constant threat.

“Russia has started lumping together all of ‘the external enemies’ that it’s created over the years for itself: the migrants, the Ukrainians, the West,” said Tajik journalist Sher Khashimov, who focuses on migration, identity and social issues. “It all becomes this part of this single narrative of Russia being this castle under siege, and Putin being the only person who is on the lookout for ordinary Russians.”

The Uzbek immigrant in Moscow said Russia has created conditions “supposedly to help people, to help migrants.”

“But the rules do not work,’ he added. ”Special barriers are created that migrants cannot pass through on their own.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/ca4ebd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6133x3450+0+320/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb5%2F88%2F28e2ead1332fcbe5f0a548d380f9%2F0e95d1ebe91245a6a7b1785d4ee2b70e,N,,2025-08-22 15:56:32.421636

Mario Guevara, 47, was arrested by police near Atlanta on June 14 while filming a “No Kings” protest — which sprung up in opposition to President Trump’s immigration agenda and summer military parade in Washington.

Guevara has a large following and frequently covers issues tied to immigration in the Peach State as the founder of MG News.

A judge in DeKalb County, Ga., dismissed his charges of unlawful assembly, obstruction of police and being a pedestrian on or along the roadway on June 25, but Guevara remains in federal custody.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Guevara is in the country illegally, while his lawyers say he is authorized to work and remain in the U.S. Over the past two months, he’s been shuffled through three detention centers despite attempts to pay a bond set by the immigration judge.

Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the bond, which has resulted in a delay in Guevara’s release.

Local, regional and national press organizations have objected to his prolonged stay in custody by sending a letter to DHS last week urging Secretary Kristi Noem to release him on bond without delay.

“Every day Mario Guevara remains in federal custody is another day the government sends a chilling message that our freedoms are no longer guaranteed but merely conditional in the United States,” said Nora Benavidez, Free Press’s senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights.

“His children now been without their father for two months; each of those days is time they cannot get back with him,” Benavidez continued. “If people like Mario Guevara are cast as dangerous, that says more about the kind of nation we are becoming than it does about who Mr. Guevara is.”

The ACLU of Georgia has also weighed in.

“His detention on this basis is unlawful and sends a chilling message to other journalists, particularly non-citizen journalists, that they will also face retaliation if they report on public officials,” said Scarlet Kim, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, in a statement.

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 269 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 15 through 21.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Hector Garcia and Victor Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, were arrested in Dilley on Aug. 16, when they were allegedly caught transporting five illegal aliens who were locked in metal compartments affixed to a pickup truck. A criminal complaint alleges that U.S. Border Patrol agents witnessed the pickup truck travel down roads and on routes utilized by human smugglers to avoid Border Patrol checkpoints. The truck driver’s driving behavior further raised the agents’ suspicion, and, as a result, agents conducted a traffic stop. The complaint alleges that Garcia was riding as a passenger in the vehicle and had an expired work visa. Rodriguez was allegedly the driver of the truck and told the agents that the keys to compartments affixed to the sides of the truck bed were at “the yard,” though, during a pat down search, agents found him to be in possession what appeared to be toolbox keys. Using those keys, the agents were able to unlock the compartments and allegedly discovered five individuals—all confirmed to be Mexican nationals illegally present in the U.S.—hidden inside. If convicted of alien smuggling as alleged in the complaint, Garcia faces up to 10 years in federal prison, while Rodriguez faces up to five.

Mexican national Santiago Esquivel Gonzalez was arrested and charged with one count of being an illegal alien in possession of firearm. A criminal complaint alleges he attempted to sell five firearms at a location in San Antonio on Aug. 19. Immigration records revealed Esquivel Gonzalez was in the U.S. illegally. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.

In El Paso, U.S. citizen Alberto Dovali-Gamboa was arrested after USBP agents allegedly observed multiple individuals breach the border fence and enter his vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that Dovali-Gamboa disregarded an attempted investigatory traffic stop and ultimately was stopped after Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers deployed a tire deflation device. When his vehicle finally stopped, Dovali-Gamboa was placed under arrest by USBP and eight passengers—all determined to be illegal aliens—were allegedly observed laying down in the rear of his vehicle.

Joshua Magdaleno, also a U.S. citizen, was arrested on Aug. 17 after he was allegedly identified as the driver of a vehicle transporting four illegal aliens from Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia. A DPS trooper had allegedly observed the four aliens breach the border fence and enter Magdaleno’s vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that Magdaleno failed to yield to emergency lights and sirens, and that DPS had to perform a pit maneuver to immobilize the vehicle. According to the complaint, Magdaleno stated he had been recruited to pick up illegal aliens on the border through a post on Instagram.

A Mexican national was arrested during a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspection on a Union Pacific train. Mexican railroad security officers allegedly notified CBP officers that they had seen a person on one of the rail cars. A criminal complaint alleges that during the inspection, the CBP officers removed Francisco Alfredo Palacios-Guerrero from a grain hopper. Further investigation revealed that Palacios-Guerrero was previously removed from the U.S. four times, and had been convicted three times for illegal re-entry, three times for possession of narcotics, twice for battery, twice for presenting false identification, and once for an escape from jail.

A Honduran national was arrested near Maverick on Tuesday and charged with illegal re-entry. Marlon Gerardo Zavala-Garcia had been previously removed from the U.S. twice, the most recent being in January. He was convicted in Hondo on Nov. 12, 2024, for smuggling of persons and sentenced to 130 days confinement.

In Austin, a Salvadoran national was taken into federal custody after he had been arrested and booked in the Williamson County Jail. Rene Adalberto Jacinto-Rodriguez was convicted in 2009 for assault causing bodily injury of a family member and in 2010 for the aggravated felony of indecency with a child by sexual contact.

Jose Marvin Lopez-Sanchez, a Honduran national, was also taken into federal custody and charged with illegal re-entry in Austin. Lopez-Sanchez was previously removed in May 2024 after being convicted of assault causing bodily injury and criminal trespass. He was also convicted in 2023 for assault causing bodily injury of a family member and interfering with emergency request for assistance.

Mexican national Vicente Rodriguez-Santos was transferred into federal custody from the Travis County Jail where he had been booked for his third DWI arrest. Rodriguez-Santos was previously removed from the U.S. in 2018. In addition to the prior DWI convictions, he was convicted in August 2016 for criminal trespass, in October 2016 for theft property, and in 2017 for possession of a controlled substance.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Kealy Moriarty would not specifically verify the authenticity of the document, but did not dispute its details.
“As ICE rapidly grows, we’re coordinating with DHS and our federal partners including DOD and the Tennessee National Guard to support transportation and logistics at our facilities across Tennessee,” an ICE spokesperson said.

The Tennessee Lookout first reported on the mobilization of the National Guard. The Scene recently obtained what appears to be one page taken from an internal Tennessee National Guard document that details the orders.

The document is dated July 30, 2025, and marked “CUI,” or “controlled unclassified information."" It states that the 1-181st Field Artillery Regiment (FAR), based out of Chattanooga, will deploy to Nashville's Department of Homeland Security facility on Brick Church Park Drive beginning in September. FAR is set to assist with “case management, logistical support, and clerical support of the in-processing and out-processing of illegal aliens in Nashville, TN to allow ICE to dedicate trained agents to core law enforcement activities, enhancing overall effectiveness.""

The “projected tour of duty” is Sept. 1 to Dec. 15, “with a possible extension"" through the end of the year. Soldiers will be activated under “Title 32 active duty status (Mobilization Authority TBD) and will NOT be in State Active Duty.”

Soldiers who live within 50 miles of the DHS facility will be prioritized for the mission, which according to the document will “perform strictly non-law enforcement duties within ICE facilities.” They will be “specifically prohibited from direct contact with individuals in ICE custody or involvement in any aspect of the custody chain.”

When contacted for comment by email, the Tennessee Military Department's joint public affairs director Capt. Kealy Moriarty would not specifically verify the authenticity of the document, but did not dispute its details. Moriarty noted that soldiers’ work in assisting ICE at “processing facilities within the state” will consist of “data entry, case management, and logistical support.”

“The Tennessee National Guard regularly works alongside local, state, and federal agencies in support roles throughout the year, and this assistance reflects our commitment to interagency partnerships,” Moriarty told the Scene on Aug 12.

Moriarty also declined to say how many troops will take part in the mission or if — regardless of their administrative duties — they will be armed. “Planning is currently underway, and we will continue to coordinate with our state and federal agencies to determine how best we can support this request,” she said.

At an Aug. 13 press conference, the Scene asked Gov. Bill Lee what Tennesseans should expect to see with immigration enforcement in the streets of Nashville and other cities. He provided little insight.

“Obviously, the operations of ICE are federal operations so we don't plan those, so I can't speak to what will happen over the next year as it relates to those operations from ICE, other than the fact that we will be a willing partner,” Lee said. “We want to work with them to make sure that we remove criminals from our streets.”

ICE declined to provide any details on what its operations in Nashville will look like throughout the remainder of 2025, including how many agents will take part in the operation.

“As ICE rapidly grows, we’re coordinating with DHS and our federal partners including DOD and the Tennessee National Guard to support transportation and logistics at our facilities across Tennessee,” an ICE spokesperson said. “This unified approach ensures we’re fully equipped to carry out our expanding mission.”

ICE is set to see unprecedented growth following the increase of its annual budget from $8.7 billion to $27.7 billion with the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

“What the people in Nashville will see is obviously more individuals and more agents, but they'll also see more training and equipment,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem during a July press conference in Nashville. “We'll see more investigative tools that will be able to be utilized. My hope is that we also get the chance to work with the Department of Justice to get more immigration judges.”

While specific enforcement details are unclear, the National Guard document highlights ongoing public outcry over immigration enforcement actions throughout the state.

“This mission is closely monitored by media and actors determined to cast our forces in a bad light,” the document reads. “We will ALWAYS maintain understanding of what optics our actions present and will always maintain military bearing.”

This mobilization comes as Lee is deploying more than 160 soldiers to Washington, D.C., a move made by several Republican governors in support of Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. and the city’s alleged “crime emergency.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nashvillescene.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/48/2480e438-d6bc-4162-bf62-63687e2ee011/684c9f5d6786c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-22 15:56:36.431087

California Congresswoman Doris Matsui said Friday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has denied her access to its facility in downtown Sacramento, after she and Sacramento city leaders demanded the access over reports of ""abhorrent conditions"" for people being detained in the building's basement.

She held a press conference in Sacramento Friday at 11 a.m. Watch that video below.

Earlier this week, Matsui and the Sacramento city leaders sent letters requesting an inspection of the facility located at the John E. Moss Federal Building located at the Capitol Mall.

The letters said the Moss Building is reportedly being used to detain people overnight in poor conditions that include limited water, lack of food, lack of access to restrooms, inadequate ventilation and denial of beds.

The city's letter included a signature from Sacramento Mayor Kevin McCarty and all members of the city council, along with Sacramento County Board of Supervisors Chairman Phil Serna.

""We are requesting access to tour the facilities, because it is our understanding that this building was not designed for the detention of individuals overnight and lacks the proper facilities,"" the letter from Sacramento officials said.

According to the city's letter, there are claims that agents and staff are documenting the amount of food and water the people detained are receiving and are aware it may not be sufficient.

If the reported facility conditions are true, ICE would not be in compliance with the 2025 National Detention Standards, which would be unlawful, according to Matsui's office.

Tom Morello, guitarist for Rage Against the Machine and a longtime activist, has released a striking 65-track playlist titled “F ICE,” aimed squarely at the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the enforcement actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The collection is a potent mix of protest, rock, and hip-hop tracks, chosen to highlight resistance, civil rights, and social justice through music.

The playlist spans decades and genres, featuring Rage Against the Machine classics alongside songs by Bruce Springsteen, Public Enemy, The White Stripes, Pearl Jam, and Rise Against. Among the standout tracks are Rage’s “Killing in the Name,” a furious call to challenge authority; Public Enemy’s politically charged anthem “Fight the Power”; Springsteen’s reflective protest ballad “The Ghost of Tom Joad”; and The White Stripes’ raw garage-rock track “Icky Thump,” which Morello has said resonates with defiance against oppressive systems. Morello also includes his own solo track, “Pretend You Remember Me,” reflecting personal engagement with political issues.

Morello, known as much for his activism as his guitar work, has a long history of blending music with political messaging. In June 2025, he joined thousands in downtown Los Angeles for the “Defend LA” protest, organized in response to recent ICE raids in the city. Images from the event capture him holding a “Defend LA” sign and wearing a t-shirt that reads “Destroy American Fascism.” The playlist continues this activism, providing a musical backdrop for resistance and urging listeners to confront political issues through song.

In discussing the playlist, Morello described it as “a rocking little soundtrack to enjoy while you drive those bastards out of your neighborhood.” He hopes the compilation will inspire fans not only to listen but to act, demonstrating that music can be a powerful tool for social change. While the songs cover a wide musical spectrum, they are united by a central theme: challenging injustice and advocating for human rights.

Beyond the playlist, Morello’s career has been defined by fusing music and activism. From the politically charged lyrics of Rage Against the Machine to his solo projects and collaborations with socially conscious artists, he has consistently used his platform to address inequality, systemic oppression, and authoritarianism. “F ICE” continues that trajectory, translating decades of political engagement into a curated musical statement against policies he views as harmful.

Listeners encountering the playlist will find it not only a celebration of protest music but also a historical lens, connecting contemporary activism with movements from the past. Tracks like Pearl Jam’s “Do the Evolution” and Rise Against’s “Prayer of the Refugee” reinforce themes of systemic injustice, while Springsteen and The White Stripes provide emotional and sonic contrast, showing how rock and folk traditions have long contributed to social discourse.

Ultimately, Morello’s “F ICE” playlist is more than just a collection of songs. It’s a call to awareness, a demonstration of the power of music to mobilize and educate, and a continuation of a career-long commitment to political engagement. For Morello, music is inseparable from activism, and this playlist exemplifies how a carefully curated set of songs can make both a cultural and political statement.

By drawing attention to both classic protest anthems and contemporary critiques, Morello underscores the enduring relevance of music in shaping public dialogue and inspiring collective action. “F ICE” serves as a reminder that art and activism can intersect powerfully, giving audiences the opportunity to reflect, resist, and rally.

In March, two months into Trump’s term, Panama’s immigration service registered a mere 194 arrivals from Colombia via the Darien Gap – compared with 36,841 arrivals in March of the previous year.
That said, the Darien Gap has also served as a venue for the display of incredible solidarity in the face of structural dehumanisation.
The Darien Gap, too, has functioned as a de facto warzone in its own right where punitive US policy plays out on vulnerable human bodies in the interests of maintaining systemic inequality.
In that sense, then, the Darien Gap is the world.","In January, just before Donald Trump resumed command of the United States on a bevy of sociopathic promises, incoming US border czar Tom Homan announced that the new administration would be “shutting down the Darien Gap” in the interests of “national security”.

The Darien Gap, of course, is the notorious 106km (66-mile) stretch of roadless territory and treacherous jungle that straddles Panama and Colombia at the crossroads of the Americas. For the past several years, it has served as one of the only available pathways to potential refuge for hundreds of thousands of global have-nots who are essentially criminalised by virtue of their poverty and denied the opportunity to engage in “legal” migration to the US.

In 2023 alone, about 520,000 people crossed the Darien Gap, which left them with thousands of kilometres still to go to the border of the US – the very country responsible for wreaking much of the international political and economic havoc that forces folks to flee their homes in the first place.

In a testament to the inherent deadliness of borders – not to mention of existence in general for the impoverished of the world – countless refuge seekers have ended up unburied corpses in the jungle, denied dignity in death as in life. Lethal obstacles abound, ranging from fierce river currents to steep ravines to attacks by armed assailants to the sheer physical exhaustion that attends days or weeks of trekking through hostile terrain without adequate food or water.

And while literally “shutting down” the Darien Gap is about as feasible as shutting down the Mediterranean Sea or the Sahara Desert, the jungle has become drastically less trafficked in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s machinations to shut down the US border itself, essentially scrapping the whole right to asylum in violation of both international and domestic law.

In March, two months into Trump’s term, Panama’s immigration service registered a mere 194 arrivals from Colombia via the Darien Gap – compared with 36,841 arrivals in March of the previous year. This is no doubt music to the xenophobic ears of the US establishment, whose members delight in eternally bleating about the “immigration crisis”.

However, it does not remotely constitute any sort of solution to the real crisis – which is that, thanks in large part to decades of pernicious US foreign policy, life is simply unliveable in a whole lot of places. And “shutting down” the Darien Gap won’t deter desperate people with nothing to lose from pursuing other perilous paths in the direction of perceived physical and economic safety.

Nor can the enduring psychological impact of the Darien trajectory on the survivors of its horrors be understated. While conducting research for my book The Darien Gap: A Reporter’s Journey through the Deadly Crossroads of the Americas, published this month by Rutgers University Press, I found it next to impossible to speak with anyone who had made the journey without receiving a rundown of all of the bodies they had encountered en route.

In Panama in February 2023, for example, I spoke with a young Venezuelan woman named Guailis, who had spent 10 days crossing the jungle in the rain with her husband and two-year-old son. Among the numerous corpses they stumbled upon was an elderly man curled up under a tree “like he was cold”. Guailis said she had also made the acquaintance of a bereaved Haitian woman whose six-month-old baby had just drowned right before her eyes.

Guailis’s husband, Jesus, meanwhile, had experienced a more intimate interaction with a lifeless body when, tumbling down a formidable hill, he had grabbed onto what he thought was a tree root but turned out to be a human hand protruding from the mud. Recounting the incident to me, Jesus reasoned: “That hand saved my life.”

I heard about bloated corpses floating in the river, about a dead woman sprawled in a tent with her two dead newborn twins and about another dead woman with two dead children and a man who had hanged himself nearby – presumably the children’s father.

A Venezuelan woman named Yurbis, part of an extended family of 10 that I spent a good deal of time with in Mexico in late 2023, offered the following calculation regarding the prevalence of bodies in the jungle: “I can say that we have all stepped on dead people.”

For pretty much every step of the way, then, refuge seekers transiting the Darien Gap were reminded of the disconcerting proximity of death – and the negligible value assigned to their own lives in a US-led world order.

Add to that the surge in rapes and other forms of sexual violence with The New York Times reporting in April 2024 that the “sexual assault of migrants” on the Panamanian side of the jungle had risen to a “level rarely seen outside war” – and it becomes painfully clear that the individual and collective trauma signified by the Darien Gap is not something that will be summarily resolved by its ostensible “shutting-down”.

That said, the Darien Gap has also served as a venue for the display of incredible solidarity in the face of structural dehumanisation. I met a young Colombian man who had personally saved an infant from being swept away in a river. I was also told of a Venezuelan man who had carried an ailing one-year-old Ecuadorean girl through the jungle when her mother, too weak to move at a rapid pace, feared she wouldn’t make it out in time to seek medical help.

When I myself staged an incursion into the Darien Gap in January 2024, two refuge seekers from Yemen complimented me on my Palestine football shirt and did their best to assuage my apparently visible terror at entering the jungle: “If you need anything, we are here.” This from folks who had for more than two decades been on the receiving end of quite literal terror, courtesy of my own country, as successive US administrations went about waging covert war on Yemen.

The Darien Gap, too, has functioned as a de facto warzone in its own right where punitive US policy plays out on vulnerable human bodies in the interests of maintaining systemic inequality. Widely referred to in Spanish as “el infierno verde”, or The Green Hell, the gap has certainly lived up to its nickname.

And while the heyday of the Darien Gap may be at least temporarily over, the territory remains an enduring symbol of one of the defining crises of the modern era in which the global poor must risk their lives to live and are criminalised for doing so. In that sense, then, the Darien Gap is the world.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP23131483025075-1726155360.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:27.785412

""Last month in July, a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini.
""The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""
These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.
South Sudan: war-torn and unsafe Conflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.","US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy, forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out ""the largest deportation operation in American history.""

Deporting those migrants to African countries, however, was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency last year.

But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that third-country deportations — i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own — were necessary to expel people ""so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back.""

Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington, pledging to take in a yet to-be-specified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.

Alex Vines, the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, a renowned think-tank in London, highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year.

""Last month in July, a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less then ten in total, but it shows the direction of travel"", Vines told DW. ""The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""

""The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept,"" Vines further pointed out, raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.

Uganda: a stretched-out refugee nation

Just days prior to the confirmation of the deal, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, Henry Oryem Okello, claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.

But after initially denying the deal with the US government, Vincent Bagiire, the premanent secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry's, confirmed the deal while saying it was inly a ""temporary arrangement.""

Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country, according to the United Nations.

These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.

For the most part, these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population — but some think this might change:

""Uganda is a hospitable country, hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country, we are choking,"" says Dorcus Kimono, a local living in the capital, Kampala.

""If these migrants are coming to our country, we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for us?""

Alex Wandeba, another resident of Kampala, shares her views: ""Uganda is already overburdened; we have many refugees from the neighbouring countries. I feel, we have enough on the table.""

Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United States:

""I would want to hear [that if] a deal is reached with our government that the US is constructing roads, or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.”

Eswatini: a kingdom with no rights

Though prior US administrations have also conducted third-country removals, the Trump's practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights' groups.

This was particularly notable last month, when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini — the last absolute monarchy in Africa, which is known for its troubling rights record.

Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986, who leads a life of luxury while the population of 1,2 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.

The country has a deteriorating human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself, as recently as 2023.

Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the king's decision to allow those immigrants into the country, which appears to fall on deaf ears: ""We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts, who still have a chance to be rehabilitated,"" he told DW.

Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates ""pose no threat to the country or its citizens,"" as they were being kept in isolation, at least for now.

South Sudan: war-torn and unsafe

Conflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.

Edmund Yakani, President of East African Civil Society Organizations Forum, told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.

Alex Vines meanwhile believes that it's all about geopolitics: ""It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them,"" he said.

""South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of [a history of] overstay of South Sudanese"", Vines further explained, adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs, which ""may be reduced, although that has not impacted these countries particularly.""

Rwanda: acting out of good will?

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains ""the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement"" under the agreement.

Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal, Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because ""our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.""

Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauretania and Guinea-Bissau.

Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US, with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had ""enough of its own problems.""

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons vowed to ""flood"" Boston with agents after Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu doubled down on her pledge to uphold the city's sanctuary policies and resist the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Speaking on the local radio program ""The Howie Carr Show,"" Lyons responded to Wu by saying, ""Now you’re going to see more ICE agents come to Boston to make sure that we take these public safety threats out that she wants to let go back into the communities.""

He pointed to the Trump administration’s ""Operation Patriot,"" which sent federal agents into the Boston area in March and yielded over a thousand arrests.

""We are going to keep doing it in Boston,"" Lyons said. ""We’re going to continue to do our mission. We’re going to keep making Boston safe as she’s failing to do with these sanctuary city policies.""

LARGEST EVER ICE OPERATION RESULTS IN NEARLY 1,500 ILLEGALS ARRESTED IN BLUE STATE

Pressed on whether ICE will surge agents to the Boston area, similar to how agents are in Washington, D.C., Lyons responded, ""One hundred percent you will see a larger ICE presence.""

""We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,"" he added. ""And, obviously, Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuaries, and sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about in neighborhoods.""

Lyons pointed out that, during Operation Patriot, ICE pursued ""targeted enforcement operations"" of criminal aliens released by the City of Boston and Massachusetts.

Operation Patriot resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,500 illegal immigrants, including murderers, rapists, drug traffickers and child sex predators.

Sources at ICE told Fox News that 790 of those arrested had criminal convictions or charges, and 277 had final removal or deportation orders. The sources said that all the targeted criminals were roaming the streets of Massachusetts cities freely before being apprehended.

The operation ran throughout May and involved ICE teams from other states in the Northeast, as well as authorities from the FBI, DEA and ATF.

Speaking on Wednesday, Lyons said, ""There’s so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that local law enforcement have to deal with, and we can take that, you know, violent criminal illegal alien instantly out of the neighborhood.""

This follows U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi setting a deadline of Tuesday for sanctuary jurisdictions to drop their policies that block cooperation with federal authorities.

Speaking on Fox Business, Bondi said she sent letters to 32 mayors and seven governors ""telling them you better comply or you’re next.""

Bondi highlighted a letter she sent to California Gov. Gavin Newsom in which she warned that ""individuals operating under the color of law, using their official position to obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts and facilitating or inducing illegal immigration may be subject to criminal charges.""

SANCTUARY CITIES DEFY BONDI’S DEADLINE TO COOPERATE: ‘NO INTENTION OF CHANGING’

The letter, shared on social media, said cooperation between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, including on immigration enforcement, ""is vital to enforce federal law and protect national security.""

Wu publicly rejected Bondi’s demands during a press conference, calling the ultimatum a political stunt.

""Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law,"" Wu said Tuesday. ""This is our city. This is our country, and I'm so proud and grateful to show the world who our community is here in Boston and what we're made of.""

In response to Lyons' comments, Wu's office shared a statement from the mayor who was answering another reporter's question.

Wu reiterated, ""In Boston, we comply and follow all of the laws, city, state and federal. And we will not back down from communities that have made us the safest major city in the country.

""This is a beautiful, diverse, incredible city, and I have said it now very directly this administration needs to stop attacking cities to hide their own failures.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/michelle-wu.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:57:24.070277

The Guardian has previously reported on how the Trump administration has deported Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee camp.
Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians.
Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture.
The Trump administration has also announced it will end TPS for Haitian immigrants living in the US legally under the scheme.","Many thousands of immigrants living in the US who came from certain countries regarded as risky or dangerous are at the mercy of US judges and the Trump administration’s agenda to slash their work authorization and protection from deportation.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has announced the termination of temporary protected status (TPS) for citizens of seven of the 15 countries previously designated for shelter under this legal umbrella – with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) controversially citing improved conditions in some of those places.

The seven countries are Afghanistan, Haiti, Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal and Cameroon, plunging many TPS holders in those US immigrant communities into confusion and fear and prompting groups of individuals and advocacy organizations to head for the courts to shield them, with varying degrees of success so far.

On Wednesday, a federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration and halted, for now, a lower court’s order that had kept in place temporary protections for 60,000 migrants from Central America and Nepal.

This means that the Republican administration can move toward removing an estimated 7,000 people from Nepal whose TPS designations expired on 5 August. The TPS designations and legal status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire on 8 September, at which point they will become eligible for removal from the US.

The National TPS Alliance group had sued, alleging that the administration’s plan was unlawful.

In the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, some of their nationals in the US have held TPS status for over 25 years, since Hurricane Mitch caused devastating damage to both countries in the late 90s.

In July, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said it was safe to return people to Nicaragua and Honduras.

However, the United Nations said in a report that the Nicaraguan regime of co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo “has deliberately transformed the country into an authoritarian state where opposition voices are silenced and the population faces persecution and economic retaliation”.

And in April the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said: “The Nicaraguan regime is an enemy of humanity.”

Meanwhile, Honduras has the highest rate of femicides in Latin America, according to Human Rights Watch, with approximately seven femicides per 100,000 women, and across the nation the UN says 1.6 million people live with urgent humanitarian needs out of a population of 7 million. More than 50,000 Hondurans in the US are TPS holders.

Nepal was initially designated for TPS in 2015 after an earthquake disrupted and displaced millions. Noem said that “there are notable improvements in environmental disaster preparedness and response capacity”. Earlier this year, amid economic and political instability in the country, Nepal was experiencing violent clashes between civilians and police.

The Guardian has previously reported on how the Trump administration has deported Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee camp.

Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians. In the case of the Afghan immigrant population in the US, many, including some who assisted US forces in Afghanistan before the botched withdrawal by the military in 2021, are already at risk of deportation.

Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture.

“For example, on the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, we were able to document cases that, especially former government employees, once they’re back in Afghanistan, they’re picked up by the authorities and they’re being arbitrarily detained and tortured; that’s a real risk for anyone who’s deported back to Afghanistan,” said Abbasi.

She added: “The Taliban have not only taken away the fundamental rights of women, they have taken women’s autonomy as well. I’ve spoken to women in Afghanistan who have told me that they feel they are living in a prison. The US knows that Afghanistan is not a safe country.”

The Department of Homeland Security has cited rising tourism as a factor in its assessment that Afghans can be deported back there, with the US Federal Register’s item about revoking TPS for Afghans saying: “Tourism to Afghanistan has increased, as the rates of kidnappings have reduced.”

However, the US has also issued a travel warning for Afghanistan, advising Americans not to visit the country due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism and risk of wrongful detention. The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders, accused of crimes against humanity for the persecution of women and girls.

An elderly British couple detained without charge after years of living in Afghanistan are in danger of dying in custody, relatives have warned. And Afghans living in or with the prospect of returning to Afghanistan who are known or even just suspected by the Taliban of having assisted US or British forces there could be in mortal danger.

The US Congress established TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, signed by the then president, George HW Bush.

The estimated 1 million TPS holders in the US overall have not only used the program’s benefits to support themselves in the US workplace, but also to contribute an estimated $21bn annually to the economy, while paying $5.2bn in taxes, according to the advocacy group Fwd.us.

The Trump administration has also announced it will end TPS for Haitian immigrants living in the US legally under the scheme. The US embassy in Haiti warns people not to travel to the Caribbean nation, citing kidnapping and civil unrest, as does the US state department website.

While Noem acknowledged that conditions in Haiti remained dire, she said it was not in the national interest of the US to continue the TPS program for Haitians.

The poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has been engulfed in political tumult since the assassination of the then president, Jovenel Moïse, in 2021. The descent for the already-unstable country into further crisis has displaced 1.3 million Haitians, according to the International Organization for Migration, and local authorities estimate that 5.7 million face food insecurity.

An estimated 340,000 Haitians in the US who are currently covered by TPS – a designation initially made in 2010 following the devastating earthquake that year – will no longer have this protection from deportation after 2 September.

Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigrant support group in the US, said some of the people already deported to Haiti “are just dropped off” and “their family relatives don’t know what happened to them”.

“The termination of TPS is a complete unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of these immigrants, whom many of them have been in the country for over 15 years. Many of them have children who were born and raised here,” Jozef said.

“The entire Black immigrant community doesn’t fit the agenda, or are not deemed dignified enough, or not deemed worthy enough of the protection that those people need. We are at a point where they don’t care how long they have been here, that they have paid their taxes, that they have businesses.”

Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, remains largely under gang control and armed conflict has rendered the city inaccessible from both the north and south.

Violent groups dominate the city center and surrounding areas, with only two districts spared, where camps for internally displaced people have multiplied, sheltering tens of thousands who have fled violence.

In this parlous condition, the prospect of mass deportations from the US is alarming local organizations already struggling to cope.

“Where will families whose homes have been burned down go?” Katia Bonté, coordinator of the Support Group for Returnees and Refugees (GARR) in Haiti, asked.

Her organization already operates along the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, assisting people expelled daily back to Haiti under a crackdown by the Dominican government launched last October.

Bonté fears a similar wave from the US would overwhelm already fragile systems.

“Deported Haitians won’t be able to return to their families or communities. I visit the displacement camps. I see how people survive. It’s inhumane – the impact would be devastating,” she said, adding: “There’s not much hope left. It feels like we’re on our own, and no one is coming to help.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly eyeing Honduras and Nicaragua as places to send people who are from neither country originally but are being deported from the US, and has done a deal with Rwanda and, on Wednesday, with Uganda.

There was uproar from many directions when the US government deported, without due process, a group of people from a variety of countries to South Sudan and Eswatini this summer.

The money comes from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program, and voting officials say new requirements from the administration will make the money inaccessible for most of the country.

NPR is the first news outlet to report on the changes.

About $28 million — or 3% of the overall Homeland Security Grant Program — is devoted to election security and now at risk, though some officials and experts worry that the new requirements could also endanger hundreds of millions of dollars in other grants for law enforcement.

Voting officials say the amount of money at risk won't make or break the country's election security. But the potential withholding of funds over policy differences — combined with other recent election security cuts — has many wondering whether the Trump administration is prioritizing election security the way it claims it is.

""Despite the rhetoric, there's been [a] serious cutback to election security support that is being offered to the states,"" said Larry Norden, an elections expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is broadly critical of President Trump's policies. ""And this is going to be one more cut for a lot of states because most states are not going to allow the president to decide [how their elections work].""

The grant money in question is administered within DHS by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and is meant to help state and local governments prepare for and prevent terrorism and disasters. For some of the grants, DHS designates priority areas to further target what the money is spent on, and three years ago the agency began designating election security as one of those priorities.

This year, however, Trump directed DHS to adjust the election security portion of the grants as part of his March 25 executive order on voting (much of which has been paused by courts).

The new grant rules were released publicly in late July, and multiple election officials told NPR they saw them similar to that executive order: as a way for the administration to try to force their hands when it comes to policy.

""The Department of Homeland Security is trying to back-door changes to our election laws,"" said Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat. ""That is unacceptable.""

The grant applications closed earlier this month, and Maine is forgoing roughly $130,000 in election security grant money because the state does not plan to comply with the new requirements, Bellows said.

Another state election official, who spoke to NPR anonymously because they did not have permission to speak publicly, said their state was also forgoing the money. They estimated that only a handful of election offices were working with their state emergency management departments to craft the grant applications in line with the new election requirements and therefore would potentially access that money.

The new requirements

It's also unclear exactly how DHS will judge whether states meet the new demands.

One of the requirements, for instance, is that jurisdictions applying for money must ""prioritize compliance"" with federal guidelines for voting system certification that are so new they have not yet been incorporated anywhere in the country.

FEMA, which manages the grants, did not respond to NPR's questions about the new grant rules, including about how such a provision would be adjudicated considering that no state is currently using election equipment certified to the new standards. DHS also did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Another new requirement is that jurisdictions applying for election security money must use a new DHS citizenship verification tool for all people working at a polling place in ""any capacity.""

That tool, known as the SAVE system, was expanded rapidly by DHS this year, and the agency has not disclosed anything publicly about the accuracy or reliability of the information provided by the system, or about how personal data run through the system will be secured.

It's unclear whether the system has ever been used to verify election workers, considering the functionality that allows the system to search for U.S.-born citizens was only added in the past few months.

""DHS can't require us to use that system,"" said Bellows.

Concerns about other law enforcement grants

NPR has previously reported that in previous years some of the grant program's money designated for election security has not actually gone to reinforcing state voting infrastructure.

That election security portion of the grants represents a small percentage of the overall billion-dollar DHS grant program, but Norden of the Brennan Center is concerned the rest of the grant money could also be withheld if states don't comply with the elections rules.

In the section of the new election requirements, there is a line that says an applying jurisdiction must ""demonstrate proof of compliance before accessing the full"" award. Norden called the line unclear and alarming.

""You are talking about a billion dollars for state and local law enforcement to protect Americans from terrorism,"" Norden said. ""The idea that that money ... could be in any way held up is alarming for anybody who cares about the safety and security of citizens.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4032x2268+0+209/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2Fb8%2Ffdcfbb8742b4999a50d1bb38eda5%2Fap24309673948410.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 11:57:39.013228

Hours after protesters gathered at City Hall on Thursday to demand answers about the decision, Mayor Mark Dion said during a news conference that the council decided to go ahead with the agreement because the city’s lawyers believe Portland will not be required to work with the immigration agency.

During the news conference, Dion said the grant agreement would be publicly available Friday — two days after the council called an emergency workshop to discuss new terms that tied the airport funding to cooperation with immigration authorities. But the city released a digital version of the grant agreement Thursday night that was signed by city attorney Michael Goldman. City Councilor Wes Pelletier also posted the document online Thursday night.

At the meeting Wednesday night — which was held almost entirely out of public view — Dion said the council “reached a consensus” to move forward with accepting the grant for upgrades at the jetport.

“We did not consent, capitulate or embrace any condition for this money that would allow ICE to be entangled with city affairs. Period,” Dion said to a crowd of media gathered inside council chambers. “Somewhere along the line, this has become an ICE contract — it’s not. This is a grant award for infrastructure improvements at the airport.”

Dion said an item in the agreement stipulates that Maine and other states that have sued the Department of Transportation over its efforts to tie grant funding to immigration enforcement do not have to abide by the directive, so long as a judge’s injunction issued in June holds.

That temporary injunction barred the federal government from making ICE compliance a condition for DOT funding after Secretary Sean Duffy wrote a letter to grant recipients nationwide saying that cooperation was required. The conditions are outlined in Section 40 on Page 15 of the agreement.

When asked what action the city would take if a higher court reverses the injunction, Dion replied: “I can’t answer that with any certainty. Who could?”

The mayor said Thursday that some of the grant money had already been spent on airport improvements prior to the city signing the agreement.

Dion said he was not aware changes had been made to the grant’s conditions until a few days ago and that the council had not met earlier because the city only recently received the contract.

PROTESTERS DEMAND ANSWERS

The emergency meeting Wednesday raised concerns that the council was circumventing the public process. Some residents quickly organized a protest outside City Hall Thursday morning to decry the decision and ask questions.

Councilor Kate Sykes stood in the middle of the crowd of about 50 protesters and scrambled to answer questions.

“What about the citizens of Portland?” Lee Nicoloff, 72, called out. “I didn’t hear anything about this. I didn’t have a chance to share my two cents about this in a council meeting. … I was blown away when I got the message this morning.”

“Is there anything we can do?” Alexandra Magnaud, 34, asked from the crowd.

“It’s a done deal,” Sykes replied. The crowd booed.

Some held signs reading “Immigrants are not criminals, ICE is” and “No ICE in Portland,” and lobbed questions at Sykes for roughly 20 minutes.

Sykes, who was the only council member there, said she did not support the decision and noted multiple times that it was not unanimous.

“So can you tell us how everyone voted?” someone in the crowd shouted.

“I can’t,” Sykes replied. “The content of that meeting is protected.”

Prior to Wednesday’s meeting, Dion expressed frustration that the topic of the workshop had been publicly revealed beforehand: “I’m disappointed that someone who has been briefed on the nature of the executive session from our attorneys has decided to provide information to the public at this juncture,” he said.

Wednesday night’s agenda cited 1 M.R.S.§ 405(6)(E), a section of Maine law that allows government bodies to enter executive session to discuss “legal rights and duties,” litigation, settlement offers and other legal issues with an attorney but without the public present.

The council is not allowed to take votes in executive session, however.

Sykes said no formal vote had taken place and told protesters that she plans to put forth a transparency ordinance to change the protocol surrounding private meetings.

“We can never do this again,” she told the crowd. “We have to be transparent in all of the deals we have with the federal government right now.”

Some protesters voiced skepticism that the council had abided by the law.

“It sounds like they took a straw poll in executive session, which is just a vote by another name,” said Joey Brunelle, who helped organize the demonstration.

Rep. Grayson Lookner, a Democrat who represents parts of Portland in the State House, said the lack of transparency from the council was “unconscionable.”

FRUSTRATION WITH ICE

The council initially accepted the $21 million grant in January, though Dion said Thursday that the actual amount hinging on ICE cooperation was closer to $18 million. The money was set aside for gate improvement projects, new passenger boarding bridges and terminal improvements.

Sykes urged the protesters Thursday to attend future council meetings and speak during public comment. The council’s next meeting is scheduled for Monday evening.

About a dozen people broke off from the group and marched into the mayor’s office to submit written public comment. The protesters remained peaceful inside City Hall and followed protocol for submitting written public comment.

“We cannot be making secret agreements to cooperate with ICE,” Brunelle said.

Portland residents have previously expressed concerns about local cooperation with the agency. In June, more than 100 people packed a meeting of the Cumberland County commissioners to demand that the county jail stop holding ICE detainees.

“I find what’s going on with ICE to be an absolutely disgrace to our country,” Molly Gibbs, 36, said as she wrote a comment for the mayor. “It’s inhumane and un-American. The council meeting behind closed doors is very shady.”

“These small compromises are how we’ve gotten here,” added Alexandra Magnaud, 34. “I get that we have to play the game, but we’re no longer playing in a legal system that is functioning. We need to stand firm and be very clear that we do not accept this.”

Editor’s note: This story was updated on Aug. 21 to show that the city has signed the agreement and publicly released it.

City councilors agreed to accept the $18 million grant, which was previously reported to be $21 million, and reject wording in the agreement that would mandate the city to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

The grant agreement was signed late Thursday. Portland communications director Jess Grondin shared more details about the agreement through email.

""Note that the new language was added by USDOT, not ICE. The immigration enforcement provision that is the subject of the litigation is in section 31 on page 12. After the court issued the preliminary injunction, DOT added section 40, which indicates that DOT cannot enforce the provision in section 31 while the injunction is in place. Section 40 also states that by signing the agreement, we are not required to certify compliance with the immigration enforcement provision, and that DOT cannot construe our acceptance of the funds as certification of our compliance with the provision,"" Grondin wrote.

Dion said he believes it is unconstitutional for the federal government to add new terms that impose on local and state government operations, adding that the City of Portland would not agree to terms that make its immigrant population unsafe.

""We did not agree to any conditions involving ICE,"" Portland Mayor Mark Dion said during the press conference Thursday. ""We did not consent, capitulate, or embrace any condition for this money that would allow ICE to be tangled in city affairs. Period.""

The grant is for infrastructural improvements for things including the replacement of aging boarding bridges, new snow removal equipment, updated bathrooms, and more, Dion said.

The grant application was approved in January, Dion explained. Between then and the receipt of the awards, the U.S. Department of Transportation added language requiring recipients cooperate and not impede ICE and federal officers and components of the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of federal immigration law, according to Dion.

After the new wording was added, Maine and 19 other states went to federal court seeking to block the language involving ICE cooperation, Dion said. The federal judge issued an emergency preliminary injunction blocking ICE from the enforcement or application of those provisions to any grant recipient.

The ICE component did raise conversations and concerns among city councilors, Dion said. The councilors agreed the best way to deal with the situation was to accept the federal money and preserve standing to wage legal contest with the federal government down the road, if necessary.

The city also spoke with the Office of Attorney General. Dion said the office agreed that accepting the money does not make the city subordinate to ICE.

""This is not an issue of immigration, and ICE has no business, to our mind, to interfere in those responsibilities that we're trying to carry out as it applies to our jetport,"" Dion said.

Despite the city being completely against the newly added conditions, Dion said they cannot guarantee that the lawsuit will turn out in their favor.

Portland city council member Kate Sykes said that in agreeing to move forward and receive the grant funding and knowing the possible implications, she believes the city council backdoored its own people, making this deal through closed executive session.

""I think that when we compromise our values to quote on quote stay in a legal battle, we've already lost the fight,"" Sykes said. ""Immigrants need to be able to trust that when they call 9-1-1 and call police to their door that they will not be abducted and sent to a prison somewhere outside of our country.""

She said Portland's immigrant community is now at risk because of the council's actions, adding that she fears that these actions increase the likelihood of federal overreach in local government.

""It is a decision that directly impacts some of the deepest values that Portlanders have around what our city is, whether or not we are free to make our own decisions, whether or not we're going to make life more difficult for the immigrants that are living in our city, and I think it's a real problem that we didn't have a public process around this,"" Sykes told NEWS CENTER Maine outside city hall.

Just last month, there was pushback against the Jetport offering incentives to a small airline, Avelo, that has also entered into agreements with the Department of Homeland Security.

Earlier this year, news reports indicated that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had shared the personal data of people who received Medicaid-covered services with DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in order to aid immigration enforcement. The two agencies eventually entered into a formal data-sharing arrangement. While undocumented individuals are not eligible for Medicaid, states receive federal Medicaid funding for emergency services regardless of immigration status, giving states and CMS important information about patients who are noncitizens. Following the data disclosure, nearly two dozen states sued HHS and DHS in federal court, arguing the agencies violated federal privacy laws, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The court's preliminary injunction prohibits DHS from using the Medicaid data it obtained from the plaintiff states and HHS from sharing new data with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. Calling the Administration's data sharing policy a ""bolt-from-the-blue reversal,"" the court agreed that the government had failed to undertake a reasoned decision-making process and likely acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA. As the court noted, CMS' disclosure broke from decades of federal precedent, with HHS and DHS publicly indicating for years (and continuing to indicate) that Medicaid data will only be used for health coverage purposes. The order remains in place until 14 days after DHS and HHS have completed a ""reasoned decisionmaking process"" regarding the data sharing policy or until the litigation ends (whichever comes sooner).

The court left open the question of whether the Medicaid data disclosure violated federal privacy laws, though it suggested DHS may be able to obtain data from HHS subject to certain limitations. While the preliminary injunction is a key victory for states seeking to protect Medicaid enrollees' data, it is possible DHS and CMS may be able to establish a data-sharing policy in the future, depending on how the litigation unfolds.

The incident, which was recorded and shared on social media, has garnered thousands of views.

The footage shows Jade Michalski being carried into a Ringgold Police cruiser. A Facebook live captured her confrontation with officers. Watch below:

Minutes earlier, Michalski walked between police and the police car holding the suspect, Obrey Jiminez, claiming officers refused to provide him with medical treatment.

The incident began when a Georgia State Patrol trooper pulled over Jiminez in this white van.

According to a Ringgold police report, the trooper was engaged in a struggle with Jiminez just before Michalski began recording the encounter. Officers had determined that Jimenez was operating a vehicle without a valid license.

The Georgia State Patrol later provided these details of the arrest in their report:

Jimenez was instructed multiple times to exit the vehicle but refused to comply. While being given verbal commands, he reached between the driver and passenger seats, prompting the Trooper to remove him from the vehicle. During the arrest, Jimenez resisted and attempted to flee; however, the Trooper regained control and placed him in custody.

As officers waited for a tow truck to arrive to pick up the van, police say Michalski asked them if an ambulance was on the way for Jiminez, who was arrested for driving without a license and obstruction.

Elizabeth Haley, a friend of Michalski, said,

Jade saw a brown man being arrested and harassed asking for medical care,' said Elizabeth Haley, a friend of Michalski. 'And as any decent human would, [they] stepped in to say, hey, can we make sure he gets that medical care?

Dispatchers on Broadcastify attempt to call for an ambulance, but were advised that none were available.

The police report says Michalski stepped in front of the patrol vehicle when officers informed them they were taking Jiminez to jail for medical treatment instead.

In the video, Michalski can be heard saying, ""I WILL NOT MOVE,"" before being detained.

We asked attorney McCracken Poston, who knows Michalski's family, when trying to help crosses the line into breaking the law.

I know that videoing these encounters is not intrusive. You know, other things may be or may be considered that, or they may be considered justified. It's just hard to tell at this juncture,"" he said.

Despite the outcome, Haley believes Michalski's actions were justified.

Jade would say that it was worth it, because they we've had attention drawn to this issue,"" she said.

The Catoosa County Sheriff tells us Jiminez has now been turned over to federal officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We've requested the Georgia State Patrol report that details why Jiminez was pulled over and what started the altercation with Troopers.

Michalski faces charges including disorderly conduct and obstructing officers.

Catholic churches that serve Spanish-speaking communities in the Archdiocese of Washington have reported anxiety as encounters with immigration enforcement continue to function as a major aspect of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital.

Sacred Heart Shrine in Columbia Heights reported that six of its parishioners were detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in recent weeks, including an usher who was on his way to evening Mass. Other parishes in the archdiocese have also expressed concern amid the current situation in the District.

This comes after the Trump administration announced Aug. 11 the deployment of federal agents and the National Guard in order to crack down on widespread crime in D.C.

Following an executive order from Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith, D.C. police officers have been permitted to notify ICE agents of encounters with undocumented migrants, resulting in tight collaboration between the two law enforcement agencies in the city.

Sacred Heart Shrine’s pastor, Father Emilio Biosca Agüero, OFM Cap, told Religion News Service that one of the parishioners detained by ICE was a man in marriage preparation, while another was in a confirmation class.

Some of the detainees, the pastor noted, were stopped by immigration officials while on their way to the shrine for catechetical classes over the past several weeks. Bisoco estimated in the report that Mass attendance at his parish has dropped about 20% from 2,500 to less than 2,000 people.

The priest also said the parish WhatsApp chats “have been filled with immigration agent sightings and warnings to parish members.”

Biosca Agüero declined to comment to CNA on the story.

Last month, an ICE spokesperson told CNA: “While ICE is not subject to previous restrictions on immigration operations at sensitive locations, to include schools, churches, and courthouses, ICE does not indiscriminately take enforcement actions at these locations.”

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” the spokesperson noted, adding: “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removed from the United States.”

According to the RNS report, attendance at St. Gabriel Catholic Church in the Petworth neighborhood of D.C. has also gone down.

The communications director at Our Lady Queen of the Americas parish, Kevin Arevalo, told CNA that “the parishioners that we have had coming to Sunday Mass have expressed concerns and fears over the situation here in D.C.”

Arevalo said there have not been any detentions on church grounds and that he is not aware of any parishioners being detained on their way to attend Mass at the parish or nearby.

However, he noted several detentions he has heard of have taken place in neighborhoods like Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant, and many parishioners of Our Lady Queen of the Americas “have to go through those areas to get to our parish.”

As such, Arevalo and the parish’s administrator, Father James Morrison, are currently preparing alternative ways to reach the community amid rising fears regarding immigration enforcement.

“I know that most of them live pretty far and go out of their way to come here for our Masses and activities,” he said, “so we’re looking at using digital media and our channels, our online channels, to reach out to them and serve them in whatever best way possible we can.”

(Story continues below)

He concluded: “We definitely won’t stay quiet about this because our parish, the majority, is Hispanic-Latino community. So you want to make sure that we’re listening to them and we’re attentive to what they’re going through.”

“These guys have sought to completely confuse people on who is an illegal alien,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law policy at George Washington University.
That portion rose to about four in 10 among undocumented immigrants and immigrants with limited English.","The Trump administration is attempting to reverse decades-old policy to exclude a broad group of immigrants from accessing social services and health benefits, a move that is causing widespread fear among immigrant advocates even as it has yet to take effect.

Immigration groups and health experts say it could harm millions by cutting off access to basic health services, including for people who are U.S. citizens and immigrants who have legal permission to be in the country. They have been pressing the administration for more information, but say there have been few details forthcoming.

“That’s the other thing about these notices, they leave so many questions unanswered,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel on health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

“They don’t tell people how immigration status will be verified, whose immigration status is relevant,” she added. “They say more guidance is forthcoming, but they don’t name the services that are exempt from restrictions, and they leave people confused on what they should do.”

The administration in July announced it was reinterpreting a 1996 federal law that has allowed immigrants access to certain public benefits, part of an effort to further crack down on what the White House says is the abuse of taxpayer services by undocumented immigrants.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it was expanding the definition of “federal public benefit” to include a host of new services that would be off-limits to undocumented immigrants – including Head Start, Title X family planning services, and the community health center program.

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a statement announcing the new policy.

The move “restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people,” Kennedy said.

The policy was supposed to take effect immediately without any public input.

But after being sued by 20 blue states and the District of Columbia, HHS agreed to pause enforcement nationwide until Sept. 10 while considering public comments, which were due Aug. 13.

The agency said it would determine whether to provide any additional information. Plaintiffs in the case are expecting a judge to issue an order on the lawsuit by September 10th, according to Broder.

Advocates said the administration’s shift fits a pattern.

Undocumented immigrants have long been ineligible for programs like Medicaid, Medicare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). But the administration and Republicans in Congress are going further.

“These changes, just like many of the attacks that the administration has perpetuated against immigrants and the immigrant community, are really not actually about undocumented immigrants,” said Esther Reyes, a campaign strategist for the Protecting Immigrant Families coalition.

“In reality, they don’t have eligibility for these programs to begin with. So what [the administration is] actually doing is limiting access and restricting eligibility for people who are actually here with authorization and with a lawful status,” Reyes said.

For instance, Reyes said many U.S. citizen children have parents who are undocumented or have other types of immigration status. So even if those children are eligible and entitled to use a program, they may get shut out due to confusion and misunderstanding about the restrictions.

The sweeping change was announced just weeks after the “big beautiful” tax and spending law imposed new restrictions on food aid and health programs for immigrants. Combined with the new restrictions, experts and advocates said the changes will likely have chilling effects on immigrant families, making them reluctant to seek out the care and services they need.

“People are going to … retreat further into the shadows of our society,” said Mitesh Popat, CEO of the Venice Family Clinic, a community health center serving more than 45,000 people in the Los Angeles area.

“This will just further entrench those people as an underclass of people who are afraid to come out, afraid to get needed nutritional assistance, send their children to school and receive health care services,” Popat said.

The Clinton administration’s 1996 welfare reform restricted services like Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and more to a category of “qualified immigrants.”

Now, the Trump administration wants to add 13 more programs to the list.

A qualified immigrant is not necessarily undocumented. The category includes people in the country with a nonimmigrant visa, people who have applied for asylum, people with Temporary Protected Status, those who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others, according to health research nonprofit KFF.

“These guys have sought to completely confuse people on who is an illegal alien,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law policy at George Washington University.

The change most concerning for advocates involves federal funding for community health centers, a program that funds more than 15,000 clinics.

Community health centers are often the providers of last resort. A 2023 KFF survey found three out of 10 immigrant adults said a CHC is their usual source of care. That portion rose to about four in 10 among undocumented immigrants and immigrants with limited English.

Health centers can’t turn anyone away, but if they are restricted from serving undocumented patients, they may not be reimbursed for care.

Under the 1996 law, nonprofits are not required to report on immigration status of the patients they serve. The new policy seemingly keeps that exemption, but HHS wasn’t clear.

Advocacy groups fear the administration is attempting to turn health centers and other places where people receive services into immigration checkpoints.

“Our purpose for existing, we’re not supposed to be arbiters in the middle of deciding who can get care, who can’t get care,” said Popat.

It’s also unclear how the administration will enforce the new policy.

“We are service providers … we aren’t law enforcement. We aren’t here to adjudicate whether someone’s ID looks legitimate or not, or someone’s papers look legitimate or not,” Popat said.

This conflict between the federal government’s policy change and the statutory requirement for CHCs will likely cause confusion among providers and immigrant patients alike.

“There’s this very complicated patchwork of different regulations right now on the federal, state and local level, in terms of who is or isn’t required to check immigration status. And that’s just going to put a huge burden on these community health centers,” said Sweta Haldar a senior policy analyst at the Democratic-aligned Families USA.

Cutting off access to affordable community health center care will likely send people to emergency departments, a costly visit for patients that could also exacerbate overcrowding and long wait times/

“Immigrants and citizens work together in families and communities, and that excluding anybody from health care, compromises the health and well-being of all of us,” Broder said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Immigration_082225_AP_Jessie-Wardarski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-22 10:56:24.456004

“Treating all migrants and refugees as if they were violent criminals is simply unjust. They are human beings made in God’s image,” wrote Archbishop Shawn McKnight, Bishop Carl Kemme, and Bishop Gerald Vincke in the letter.

Both Pope Francis, who died in April, and Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, have been critical of Trump’s mass deportations and descriptions of immigrants as criminals.

The Kansas Legislature passed a resolution in April to encourage Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — who has condemned Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, like his deployment of the National Guard on U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles — to “fully cooperate with the policies of the Trump administration in enforcing federal immigration laws.”

The resolution encourages compassion for immigrants — who are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born Americans — but includes a paragraph that asserts “illegal immigration leads to severe repercussions for our entire state, including threats to public safety and public health via human trafficking, the deadly fentanyl crisis and strains on public resources.”

Some of the legislators who voted yes on the resolution are Catholic, including Republican Rep. David Buehler from Lansing.

Buehler said he found the bishops’ letter, which acknowledges criminals are taking advantage of the country’s broken immigration system, to be incomplete.

“We don’t have anything in the way of policy in the state of Kansas that I think is not kind. I think we all stand for law and order and humane treatment of all people,” Buehler said. “But I think we have to consider all aspects of this issue, and we can’t turn a blind eye to the impact on our schools, to the impact on our health care. There are so many pieces and parts.”

Buehler said he is worried about what he sees as the unintended consequences of immigration, which he believes were exacerbated when President Joe Biden was in office.

“We should have humane treatment for immigration and those who may be here illegally, but we also at the same time should enforce the laws of this country,” Buehler said. “We can do both.”

Throughout their letter, the bishops encouraged Kansans to see immigrants as humans rather than criminals.

“Amid political division and fear, we remind our communities that at the center of every immigration debate are real people: families in our pews, children in our schools, workers in our neighborhoods, and volunteers in our parishes,” the bishops wrote.

Shabina Kavimandan immigrated to Kansas from India in 1998. She said she started volunteering with Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher’s campaign for governor in part because of Holscher’s kindness toward immigrants.

“There are certain members of a party that always say they align with so many religious views, especially when it comes to ‘pro-life’ issues,” Kavimandan said. “I see that they believe in life, and the value of life. And then on the other hand there is such a dismissal of the reasons why people choose to come to this country.”

Kavimandan said she stayed in the United States in part because of her determination and also because of Kansans’ interest in knowing and helping her as a person.

“There were people who sat across from me and asked about Shabina the individual. I see that missing now,” Kavimandan said. “That’s another piece that lawmakers tend to overlook sometimes. Behind all the policies there really are just people and their stories. There’s a Shabina who came to this land with $200 in her pocket, but then there were people who were like ‘We have to make sure that she becomes something in this country.’ ”

According to Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora, ICE agents arrived around 7 a.m. in unmarked vehicles with blacked-out windows. They attempted to detain a man but failed to produce a judicial warrant. When the man fled into his home, the standoff began.

""Trenton Police are here just strictly to keep the peace in the neighborhood,"" Gusciora told CBS News Philadelphia. ""We're not here to assist ICE. Shame on ICE for not having the warrant to begin with.""

Outside the home, dozens of neighbors, including members of a local ""rapid response team,"" gathered behind police tape, demanding transparency and accountability.

Ana Puello, a resident of Chambersburg for more than a decade, said the neighborhood is home to families from Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and beyond.

""They don't have the paperwork,"" Puello said of ICE.

""This is a sanctuary community,"" she said about the neighborhood.

Pastor Erich Kussman, of St. Bartholomew Lutheran Church, said he knows the family well. The man ICE was seeking is a day laborer. His wife works at a cleaning company. They have five children, ranging in age from 1 to 10.

""There's a whole family inside,"" Kussman said. He added, ""We welcome Jesus when we welcome the people that are immigrants in our neighborhood.""

The agents wearing vests marked ""POLICE U.S. BORDER PATROL"" and ""POLICE HSI"" (Homeland Security Investigations) remained outside the home until about 11:45 a.m., eventually leaving without making an arrest.

""ICE should be acting responsible. They should have a warrant, they should tell us when they're here, and they should tell us the reasons why they're picking up the person. Again, if it's a gang member or somebody who's in a drug cartel, we'll support that,"" Gusciora said.

One protester was briefly arrested for crossing police tape but was later released.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, condemned the operation.

""To come and to be masked, to not identify yourself, to not show your badge, that's something that you see in other countries. You don't see that in the United States of America. It's very un-American,"" Coleman said.

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department's new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews.

But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9941acf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2Fb5%2F916bbc8c4f6d83e07f68fb6ba37c%2Fap25226635647511.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:56:28.900752

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump’s mass deportation goal. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They’re hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they’re hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour’s drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don’t know what might be coming at them.

“We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,” said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,” he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.”

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone’s house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can’t — and don’t — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3c327be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+257/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fe6%2Fd1%2Fba04724362881e0498045e2f499c%2F6e72832c6d7c429c99f722986c015e55,N,,2025-08-22 11:58:10.563783

Unlawfully Withheld Visas Under Trump's Travel Ban, Judge Rules","Zach Montague, www.nytimes.com, zach-montague",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/state-dept-travel-ban-ruling.html,"A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration had unlawfully withheld visas from a number of people because of a travel ban President Trump instituted in June, which barred visa access for individuals from 19 countries.
The ruling could have broader implications for the approximately 29,000 others from countries covered by the travel ban who won the diversity visa lottery in 2024, according to State Department data.
She concluded that she was unable to direct the State Department to reverse those decisions.
In an accompanying order, Judge Sooknanan directed the State Department to “expeditiously process” and approve the remaining 82 applications.
“Defendants miss the gravity of what the plaintiffs stand to lose,” Judge Sooknanan wrote.","A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration had unlawfully withheld visas from a number of people because of a travel ban President Trump instituted in June, which barred visa access for individuals from 19 countries.

The decision from Judge Sparkle Sooknanan in Federal District Court in Washington applied narrowly to seven dozen people who had been selected for entry to the United States on “diversity visas.” Such visas offer a pathway to permanent residency, and 55,000 of them are granted every fiscal year to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States.

She found that those individuals were then unlawfully refused the visa because of the travel ban Mr. Trump had instituted more than a year after they had won the lottery in May 2024. The ruling could have broader implications for the approximately 29,000 others from countries covered by the travel ban who won the diversity visa lottery in 2024, according to State Department data.

The individuals involved in the lawsuit hailed from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Togo, Somalia and Iran, and their visas were either denied outright or remained in processing. The lawsuit argued that the Trump administration had stalled, refusing to process visa requests before Sept. 30, when their eligibility to receive a visa through the program is set to expire.

Judge Sooknanan, who was appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., rejected the government’s argument that the State Department should be allowed to act on Mr. Trump’s order and ignore pending applications from countries that had been included on the list, given that existing laws allow people to get visas through the lottery program.

In her opinion, Judge Sooknanan cited a precedent set by the Supreme Court last year that prohibits federal agencies from relying on their own interpretations of the law to make policy, adding that the State Department had done so in this case.

She wrote that the administration had cited “longstanding practice” in seeking to deny visas to people barred by presidential action, but that doing so represented “turning away from the text of any statute.”

Judge Sooknanan noted severe limitations on the court’s authority that she said could result in the individuals ultimately being turned away from the country despite her order.

Out of the 84 individuals involved, she wrote that two had already seen their visas formally denied. She concluded that she was unable to direct the State Department to reverse those decisions.

Furthermore, she noted that even though she could require the Trump administration to process the visa applications before Sept. 30, the individuals affected by the president’s order could still be denied admission to the country at a port of entry for any number of other reasons, with little recourse.

In an accompanying order, Judge Sooknanan directed the State Department to “expeditiously process” and approve the remaining 82 applications. But she stressed in her opinion that the ban had upended the lives of those in what she described as the inauspicious position of winning the lottery amid Mr. Trump’s presidency — an opportunity that many people never have despite applying every year for decades.

“Defendants miss the gravity of what the plaintiffs stand to lose,” Judge Sooknanan wrote. “The plaintiffs literally won the lottery; they were randomly selected from millions of people around the world hoping for one of a handful of visas that could give them a chance to immigrate to the United States.”

“It may well be that, because of circumstances outside of their control, they will ultimately be unable to enter the United States even if they get a visa,” she added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21dc-visas-pkvt/21dc-visas-pkvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:23.655840

The Department of Corrections remains an exception under the state law.
“I don’t think that we have done everything in our ability to keep communities safe,” said state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma.
And the agency doesn’t allow agents to interview incarcerated people on their immigration status while in prison, unless the person consents.","Dozens of Democratic lawmakers in the Washington Legislature have pushed in recent months to reassess how the state Department of Corrections shares information with federal immigration authorities.

But Washington’s governor and attorney general, both first-term Democrats, see no need to change current policy.

The Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, strictly limits local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. This month, the statute has spawned a war of words between Gov. Bob Ferguson and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over whether it violates federal law.

The Department of Corrections remains an exception under the state law. And that doesn’t sit well with some Democrats.

“I don’t think that we have done everything in our ability to keep communities safe,” said state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma. “Certainly, I don’t think we’ve done enough with Department of Corrections information sharing.”

The state agency can ask for and collect information about inmates’ immigration status and country of origin to share with embassies, spokesperson Christopher Wright said. Prison staff don’t confirm this information. And incarcerated Washingtonians aren’t required to provide it.

The Department of Corrections sends a weekly report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement listing the names of everyone newly admitted to the state’s prisons, regardless of immigration status. ICE compares those names to its list of people who they believe should be deported.

Agents can then share detainer requests with the Department of Corrections, allowing the prison system to let immigration authorities know when people will be released and coordinate transferring custody to ICE.

Corrections doesn’t hold people beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up, Wright noted. And the agency doesn’t allow agents to interview incarcerated people on their immigration status while in prison, unless the person consents.

Despite the information sharing between the department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the number of people federal immigration authorities detain after their release from Washington prisons has been dropping for years, state data shows.

Of the 61 prisoners wanted by immigration authorities who have been released this year, ICE has picked up 51 of them, the highest rate in the past decade. In 2024, immigration agents detained 101 of 128 of those leaving prison.

The number of prisoners exiting with ICE detainers has dropped over the past decade from more than 300 in 2015. This mirrors a declining prison population in general, Wright said.

The more than 500 prisoners still in custody with ICE detainers have mostly been convicted of violent offenses. More than one-third are serving time for murder convictions, and more than one-quarter are in prison on rape charges, according to state data.

ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t provide comment.

‘Why do we do this?’

In a letter to Ferguson in June, around four dozen state lawmakers, as well as city and county council members from western Washington, called for a second look at the Department of Corrections’ role under the law.

Mena, who spearheaded the letter, met with top aides from Ferguson’s office about the concerns. She said they were receptive to changing prison policy. She’s now figuring out ways the Department of Corrections is sharing information that isn’t required by federal law that Ferguson could address through executive action, instead of through new legislation.

For example, she says prison staff don’t need to ask prisoners about citizenship status. She also wants Corrections to stop volunteering the lists of people newly admitted into prison.

“I want to have a deeper conversation about, why do we voluntarily share that list, as opposed to letting the Department of Homeland Security specifically request information about certain folks?” Mena said. “That is truly not required. That’s my biggest question mark is, why do we do this?”

Some worry changing the law could make it vulnerable to legal challenges.

In a February press conference, Ferguson noted advocates’ concerns about the state prisons’ continued cooperation with immigration authorities, but said he wouldn’t make changes.

Ferguson’s position hasn’t changed.

“We’re always happy to have a conversation about anything that the state’s doing,” he said in an interview Thursday. “But I think the Legislature in 2019, when they passed the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act, struck a good balance. They carved out an exception for the Department of Corrections in a thoughtful way and the Department of Corrections is acting in a way that’s totally consistent with the Keep Washington Working Act.”

Similar to Ferguson, state Attorney General Nick Brown said he doesn’t “see any reason right now to change the law” on Corrections’ information sharing with ICE.

“We want to make sure that we’re continuing to protect people in Washington from people who have committed crimes or have a risk of danger moving forward,” he said in an interview this week.

Wright, from the Department of Corrections, also said the agency has “no intention” of changing its policy.

Meanwhile, Mena said President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has created more urgency around the issue.

She has been leading the charge on this in part because of one of her constituents, Ngoc Phan, whose husband had finished a 25-year sentence for murder and assault when ICE detained him.

Tuan Thanh Phan was a lawful permanent resident from Vietnam before his conviction. He was in limbo for weeks in the African country of Djibouti as advocates fought in court the Trump administration’s move to deport immigrants to so-called third countries. These are places where the deportee has no ties.

Ferguson denied a pardon request for Phan, to the disappointment of Mena, other lawmakers and advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court in early July cleared the way for the final deportation of Phan and seven others to South Sudan in the headline-grabbing case.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-ICE-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:46.709081

An analysis of census data released by Pew Research Center on Thursday noted that between January and June, the United States’ foreign-born population had declined by more than a million people.

Millions of people arrived at the border between 2021 and 2023 seeking refuge in America after the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, which ravaged many of their home countries. In 2023, California was home to 11.3 million immigrants, roughly 28.4% of the national total, according to Pew.

In January, 53.3 million immigrants lived in the U.S., the highest number recorded, but in the months that followed, those who left or were deported surpassed those arriving — the first drop since the 1960s. As of June, the number living in the U.S. had dropped to 51.9 million. Pew did not calculate how many immigrants are undocumented.

Trump and his supporters have applauded the exodus, with the president declaring “Promises Made. Promises Kept,” in a social media post this month.

“Seven months into his second term, it’s clear that the president has done what he said he’d do by reestablishing law and order at our southern border and by removing violent illegal immigrants from our nation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a USA Today column on Thursday. “Both actions were necessary for Americans’ peace and prosperity.”

But some experts caution that such declines will have negative economic effects on the United States if they continue, resulting in labor shortages as America’s birth rate continues to drop.

“Looking ahead in the future, we’re going to have to rely on immigrant workers to fulfill a lot of the jobs in this country,” said Victor Narro, project director at UCLA Labor Center. “Like it or not, the demographics are going to be changing in this country. It’s already changing, but it’s going to be more pronounced in the future, especially with the decline in native-born workers.”

The Pew analysis highlights several policy changes that have affected the number of immigrants in the country, beginning during then-President Biden’s term.

In June 2024, Biden signed a proclamation that bars migrants from seeking asylum along the U.S. border with Mexico at times when crossings are high, a change that was designed to make it harder for those who enter the country without prior authorization.

Trump, who campaigned on hard-line immigration policies, signed an executive order on the first day of his second term, declaring an “invasion” at the southern border. The move severely restricted entry into the country by barring people who arrive between ports of entry from seeking asylum or invoking other protections that would allow them to temporarily remain in the U.S.

Widespread immigration enforcement operations across Southern California began in June, prompting pushback from advocates and local leaders. The federal government responded by deploying thousands of Marines and National Guard troops to L.A. after the raids sparked scattered protests.

Homeland Security agents have arrested 4,481 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6, the agency said this month.

Narro said the decrease in immigrants outlined in the study may not be as severe as the numbers suggest because of a reduction in response rates amid heightened enforcement.

“When you have the climate that you have today with fear of deportation, being arrested or detained by ICE — all the stuff that’s coming out of the Trump administration — people are going to be less willing to participate in the survey and documentation that goes into these reports,” Narro said.

Michael Capuano, research director at Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit that advocates for a reduction in immigration, said the numbers are trending in the right direction.

“We see it as a positive start,” Capuano said. “Obviously enforcement at the border is now working. The population is beginning to decrease. We’d like to see that trend continue because, ultimately, we think the policy of the last four years has been proven to be unsustainable.”

Capuano disagrees that the decrease in immigrants will cause problems for the country’s workforce.

“We don’t believe that ultimately there’s going to be this huge disruption,” he said. “There is no field that Americans won’t work in. Pew notes in its own study that American-born workers are the majority in every job field.”

In 2023, the last year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were part of the country’s workforce, including about 10 million undocumented individuals. Roughly 19% of workers were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier, according to Pew.

“Immigrants are a huge part of American society,” said Toby Higbie, a professor of history and labor studies at UCLA. “Those who are running the federal government right now imagine that they can remove all immigrants from this society, but it’s just not going to happen. It’s not going to happen because the children of immigrants will fight against it and because our country needs immigrant workers to make the economy work.”

The United States experienced a negative net immigration in the 1930s during the Great Depression when at least 400,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans left the country, often as a result of government pressure and repatriation programs. Not long after, the U.S. implemented the bracero program in 1942 in which the U.S. allowed millions of Mexican citizens to work in the country to address labor shortages during World War II.

Higbie predicts the decline in immigration won’t last long, particularly if prices on goods rise amid labor shortages.

“You could say that there’s a cycle here where we invite immigrants to work in our economy, and then there’s a political reaction by some in our country, and they kick them out, and then we invite them back,” he said. “I suspect that the Trump administration, after going through this process of brutally deporting people, will turn around and propose a guest worker program in order to maintain a docile immigrant workforce.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c352238/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2Fbf%2F5e670a1b4c0084b7e33b81707df5%2F1517913-me-groups-protest-immigration-raids-03-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 07:56:30.015582

The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind.","LOS ANGELES — Aurora was working as a nurse at a hospital in her home country of Honduras when she decided to leave for good. A mother of two, she yearned for a better future for herself and her young daughters. So in 1990, she went in search of that, making the journey through Mexico into the United States.

She eventually found work in Los Angeles, taking care of older adults in their homes. She bathes, feeds and changes them and sometimes takes them places, like the beauty salon. She often stays with the same clients for years, through good health and bad and, in some cases, until death.

For a while, she did this work without legal status. But then, in late 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. granted temporary protected status (TPS) to Hondurans, citing the environmental disaster the hurricane had wrought.

For the first time, Aurora had government permission to live and work in the United States.

""I felt protected,"" she says in Spanish. NPR agreed not to use Aurora's last name because she now fears being targeted by immigration authorities.

TPS for Hondurans was renewed multiple times over the years. But this year, the Trump administration decided to terminate it, effective Sept. 8.

""Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement in July. ""It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago. Honduran citizens can safely return home.""

The decision is being challenged in court. But on Wednesday, a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling, paving the way for the Trump administration to terminate TPS for Hondurans while litigation continues.

With Sept. 8 quickly approaching, Aurora faces a future of uncertainty.

""We don't know what will happen,"" she says. ""We don't know anything.""

An end to immigration programs designed to provide temporary refuge

Since returning to office, President Trump has ended a number of programs granting immigrants refuge from unsafe conditions back home, citing national security concerns.

""For decades, TPS has been abused as a de facto amnesty program to allow unvetted aliens to remain in the U.S. indefinitely,"" Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Too often, these programs have been exploited to allow criminal aliens to come to our country and terrorize American citizens.""

McLaughlin's statement included photos of Hondurans with TPS who've been convicted of crimes in the U.S., including aggravated assault and a sex offense against a child.

Aurora, who has spent most of her adult life in Los Angeles, wants to convey a different message about the roughly 72,000 Hondurans granted TPS over the years, as well as those from other countries.

""Not all immigrants are criminals,"" she says. ""We are hardworking people earning an honest living.""

Few opportunities to gain permanent status

Like so many other noncitizens in the U.S., Aurora wishes she could become a permanent resident or even a citizen. Her union, Service Employees International Union Local 2015, representing roughly half a million long-term care workers in California, has been pushing lawmakers to create a path to citizenship for people like her.

""They give so much. I think they're deserving of us being able to find a system that works for them,"" says SEIU Local 2015 President Arnulfo De La Cruz.

De La Cruz notes that caregivers represented by the union serve California's lowest-income older adults and people with disabilities — those who qualify for government-funded care.

The union does not track the immigration status of its members, but the long-term care sector relies heavily on immigrants. In a 2023 report, the California Health Care Foundation estimated that close to half of California's direct care workforce — those caring for older adults or disabled people in their homes or in facilities — are immigrants. With a rapidly aging population, California could face a shortage of between 600,000 and 3.2 million care workers by 2030, the report says.

Before the termination of TPS for many immigrants, ""we were already in a huge care shortage,"" says De La Cruz. ""There's not enough caregivers to be matched with people who need care.""

De La Cruz has heard the argument that immigrants should get in line and wait their turn. He says that it's not that simple.

""It's not an application that you fill out and you get processed,"" he says, adding that the few pathways that do exist, including through marriage to a U.S. citizen or political asylum, are difficult given the requirements.

De La Cruz is struck recalling that just a few years ago, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, care workers were recognized as essential, even heralded as heroes. The country could not do without them. And now, for at least some of them, the message is: Go home. ""To go from that to this … I think, is creating an enormous amount of stress,"" he says.

Elevated anxiety for the care workforce

Roberto Oronia is feeling that stress, even though he is a U.S. citizen, born in Los Angeles.

""This has infected everybody,"" he says. ""I say infected. It's not affected. It has infected the psyche.""

Oronia works as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home in the San Fernando Valley, alongside a lot of immigrants who, like him, have family members, friends and co-workers who fear getting caught up in Trump's immigration enforcement.

The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind. Reports that officers have been detaining people based on their appearance and that legal U.S. residents have been among those arrested have stoked fear that no person of color is safe, Oronia says.

""What's it matter whether I'm born here?"" he says. ""It's just a matter of your skin color and your last name.""

Oronia worries that the anxiety he and other care workers are experiencing could have consequences for the people under their watch.

""When anxiety's elevated, people are nervous, people are stressed, their minds are on other things,"" he says. ""Accidents happen.""

Aurora does not want to return to Honduras. Although nearly three decades have passed since Hurricane Mitch, she says her home country is still dangerous, wracked by tremendous poverty, gangs and corruption.

“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.
Much of this is targeted specifically toward immigrants from Central Asia.","The immigrant worker from Uzbekistan entered the bank in Moscow, but when he reached the teller, she refused to serve him and she wouldn't say why.

For him and others from impoverished countries across Central Asia who seek better lives in Russia, such hostility is woven into everyday life. Sometimes it bursts into outright violence.

“Mostly you notice it when you go to the hospital, a clinic, a government office: You stand in line and everyone shoots you dirty looks,” said the man, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions.

Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, over 20% of Russian businesses said they were hindered by a lack of workers, according to the Central Bank.

But rather than welcoming laborers, Russian officials are fomenting anti-migrant sentiment and increasing restrictions on immigrants, which the government says number 6.1 million, but is probably higher. The government is tracking their movement, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children’s rights to education.

The continued crackdown comes as a trial began this month for four Tajik nationals who are accused of the shooting and arson attack at a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 149 people. The four were arrested within hours of the attack and appeared in court with signs of being severely beaten. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility but Russia sought to blame Ukraine for the bloodshed.

Anti-migrant rhetoric had been growing in Russia since the early 2020s. But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years. In the eight days after the killings, she received 700 reports of injuries to immigrants, including “faces smashed against the doors of police stations,” she said.

Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin captured the public mood after the massacre, saying ""migration control is extremely important” to ensure foreign nationals carrying out “illegal activity” could be deported without a court order.

The violence drew concern from human rights groups.

“Central Asian migrants seeking work in Russia due to dire economic conditions in their countries of origin today face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and other harassment by police in Russia,” Human Rights Watch said in a report on the anniversary of the attack.

“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.

While some violence has subsided, it hasn't disappeared. In April, police raided a Kyrgyz-run bathhouse in Moscow with video showing masked men forcing half-naked bathers to crawl across the floor and deliberately stepping on them before covering the lens of a security camera.

Police also reportedly rounded up immigrants in raids on warehouses, construction sites and mosques, then coerced them into joining the military to fight in Ukraine. Some are threatened with having their residency documents withheld, while others are recently naturalized citizens who failed to register for military service. In such cases, serving in the military is presented as the only alternative to prison or deportation. For others, a fast track to Russian citizenship is offered as an incentive for enlisting.

Speaking in St. Petersburg in May, Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, said “20,000 ‘young’ citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan (and) Kyrgyzstan” were serving in Ukraine.

Those immigrants who have avoided violence still are subject to new anti-migrant laws. Much of this is targeted specifically toward immigrants from Central Asia.

In 2024, 13 Russian regions banned immigrants from certain jobs, including in hospitality, catering and finance, and even as taxi drivers. A pilot program starting in September in the Moscow region requires migrants who enter Russia without a visa to be tracked via an app. Those failing to comply are added to a police watchlist, impeding access to services like banking, and subjecting them to a possible cutoff of cellphone and internet connectivity.

A nationwide law banned children of immigrants from attending school unless they could prove they could speak Russian. Less than six weeks after the law came into force, officials told local media that only 19% of children who applied for the language test were able to take it, and the most common reason for rejection was incomplete or inaccurate documents.

Another man from Uzbekistan who has worked in Russia for almost two decades and lives in St. Petersburg said he's had to wait in line for over seven hours to get needed residency documents. The man, who also spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, hopes to stay in Russia but says the climate for immigrants has worsened.

“It’s hard to get paperwork,” he said. “There just isn’t the time.”

The oppressive laws sometimes force immigrants to resort to paying bribes. Chupik, the lawyer, believes that Russia’s system results in “violations that cannot be avoided.”

“This is exactly what this mass regulation is striving for: not for all migrants to be here legally, but for everyone to be illegal,” she said. “That way, they can extract bribes from anyone at any moment and deport anyone who resists.”

Anti-migrant sentiment is unlikely to diminish anytime soon, mostly because it's encouraged by authorities like the Investigative Committee's Bastrykin, who said immigrants “physically occupy our territory, not just with their ideology but with specific buildings” — referring to sites such as mosques.

Ultra-nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said immigrant workers “behave aggressively, causing conflicts and potentially dangerous situations.”

Migrants are an easy scapegoat for many social ills, and not just in Russia, said Caress Schenk, an associate professor of political science at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan.

“Closing borders, conducting migrant raids and tightening policies are all tools that are easy go-tos for politicians the world over,” she said. “It goes in cycles that are sensitive to geopolitical pressures, as we’re seeing now, but also things like election campaigns and domestic political rivalries.”

A surge of “anti-migrant propaganda” has dwarfed previous rhetoric of recent years, according to the Moscow-based Uzbek immigrant who was ignored by the bank teller.

“If every person paying attention to the TV, the radio, the internet is only told that migrants are ‘bad, bad, bad,’ if they only show bad places and bad people, of course, that’s what people are going to think,” he said.

Such anti-migrant rhetoric has become part of the nationalist narrative from President Vladimir Putin and others used to justify the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — that Russia is under constant threat.

“Russia has started lumping together all of ‘the external enemies’ that it’s created over the years for itself: the migrants, the Ukrainians, the West,” said Tajik journalist Sher Khashimov, who focuses on migration, identity and social issues. “It all becomes this part of this single narrative of Russia being this castle under siege, and Putin being the only person who is on the lookout for ordinary Russians.”

The Uzbek immigrant in Moscow said Russia has created conditions “supposedly to help people, to help migrants.”

“But the rules do not work,' he added. ”Special barriers are created that migrants cannot pass through on their own.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/24903b25-f6c8-457c-96cb-88b60452e2b1/wirestory_3fb300676f1855bc13e20bd7780534ea_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-22 07:56:34.123852

FFLA rules prohibit grant recipients from suing the state, potentially jeopardizing AIJ's funding.

Gov. Ron DeSantis' former top lawyer is raising questions about an immigrants' advocacy group that's suing the state over its immigration enforcement law.

And one end result could be that the group loses a pot of money it gets to serve low-income clients.

Joe Jacquot, who was DeSantis' first general counsel in 2019–20, is a board member of Funding Florida Legal Aid (FFLA), the group that administers grants to legal aid organizations. He's now a shareholder in the Gunster law firm.

In May he sent an email to FFLA executive director Donny MacKenzie, highlighting groups that received funding from FFLA and that were involved in the lawsuit against the state.

FFLA’s rules prohibit groups receiving grants from suing the state.

Jacquot raised concerns about a host ""of pure policy/political organizations suing the State of Florida"" that receive legal aid money, ""which raises a concern on our objective standards,"" he wrote.

The USA TODAY NETWORK–Florida Capital Bureau obtained the emails between Jacquot and MacKenzie, as well as MacKenzie's letters to legal aid groups, through a public records request.

State bar foundations or other entities collect interest from lawyers' pooled trust accounts and use it to fund legal aid services and access-to-justice initiatives for low-income individuals. Clients can include hurricane victims, children in foster care, as well as veterans, the elderly and disabled folks seeking to obtain benefits.

In Florida, it's called the Interest on Trust Accounts (IOTA) program, referring to the bank accounts used to hold client funds separately from a lawyer’s own money.

MacKenzie emailed Jacquot back to say he’d look into the situation, and eventually focused on Americans for Immigrant Justice (AIJ), one of the groups suing over a law (SB 4C) passed by the Legislature in February and signed by the governor.

Florida responds to Trump on need to boost immigration enforcement

The law was the result of a push by DeSantis to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement measures upon taking office Jan. 20. Legislative leaders initially rebuffed him and passed their own bill, which he vetoed as too weak.

The sides eventually reached a compromise; the new law made entering the state as an illegal immigrant a state felony, and empowered state and local law enforcement to detain suspected illegal immigrants.

A federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the law in April, saying it likely violated the U.S. Constitution by assuming powers related to immigration that only fall within the federal government’s authority. The state is appealing the ruling.

In a letter to AIJ executive director Sui Chung on June 4, MacKenzie warned the group could be in violation of FFLA’s rules and asked for an independent audit to be completed to show whether any IOTA funds were used on the lawsuit.

“The auditor’s report should clearly state what source(s) of funding were used in connection with the (lawsuit) or any similar litigation or activity that may be prohibited under FFLA’s funding requirements,” MacKenzie wrote.

If IOTA funds were used on the lawsuit, AIJ could lose funding. If not, they would still be eligible for FFLA grants.

Lawyer trust fund interest money scrutinized by lawmakers

But it’s unclear whether the audit, due by Aug. 4, was completed or what consequences resulted. MacKenzie didn’t respond to calls or emails for comment. Nor did Chung or anyone at AIJ. And Jacquot did not respond to emailed questions.

IOTA funds have been scrutinized by lawmakers in recent years after the Florida Supreme Court issued a change in the rule governing them that required banks to charge a higher rate. The rule was passed in 2023, at the same time the Federal Reserve was raising the benchmark interest rate to slow skyrocketing inflation.

That produced a large spike in IOTA funds and therefore the money given to legal aid groups. In the 2021–22 fiscal year FFLA collected $9.4 million. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, FFLA collected $260.4 million.

The grants AIJ received reflect that trend. The group received $36,470 in IOTA funds from FFLA in 2022, and $4.7 million in 2024.

Bills to lower the interest rate paid on IOTA accounts have advanced in the Senate in the last two years but have failed to gain traction in the House.","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/28/PTAL/77998181007-gi-zda-oswea-awz-qx.jpg?crop=1079,607,x0,y236&width=1079&height=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-22 06:56:17.406769

August 21, 2025

WASHINGTON — An appeals court late Wednesday said it will allow the Trump administration, for now, to move forward with ending temporary protections for 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

It means that Nepali immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, will lose their legal status – including work permits and deportation protections – immediately. Honduran and Nicaraguan holders will lose their status by Sept. 8.

The judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — Michael Daly Hawkins, Consuelo M. Callahan and Eric D. Miller — did not give a reason for their decision. Former President Bill Clinton nominated Hawkins, former President George W. Bush nominated Callahan and President Donald Trump nominated Miller in his first term.

Wednesday’s decision pauses a late July ruling from California District Judge Trina Thompson that found Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to end deportation protections for those nationals to be rooted in racism.

Instead, Thompson extended TPS for nationals from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua until Nov. 18 while the case proceeded through the courts.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek,” Thompson wrote in her 37-page ruling. “Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.”

As the Trump administration aims to carry out its plans of mass deportation of immigrants in the country without legal authorization, DHS has also moved to end the temporary legal status many immigrants have held.

Noem has acted to halt TPS for nationals from Haiti and Venezuela and end humanitarian protections for those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed, for now, many of those moves by the Trump administration.

DHS praises decision

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement called the decision from the appeals court a victory for the Trump administration.

“TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades while allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country without proper vetting,” McLaughlin said. “This unanimous decision will help restore integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe.”

Certain nationals are granted TPS because their home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to war, disaster or other unstable conditions.

Immigrants who are granted TPS go through vetting by DHS, including a background check, and have to re-apply roughly every 18 months to keep work permits and have deportation protections. A misdemeanor could result in the loss of TPS status for an immigrant.

‘Fear and uncertainty’

“I am heartbroken by the court’s decision,” Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal who is a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement.

“I’ve lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty,” Lama continued.

Many immigrants are on TPS for lengthy periods due to their home country’s condition. Those from Nepal had TPS for more than 10 years and those nationals from Honduras and Nicaragua were on TPS for more than 26 years, attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is one of the groups that filed the suit, said.

“This administration’s attack on TPS is part of a concerted campaign to deprive noncitizens of any legal status,” Emi MacLean, an attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California said in a statement. “(Wednesday’s) ruling is a devastating setback, but it is not the end of this fight. Humanitarian protection–TPS–means something and cannot be decimated so easily.”

Organizations that filed the suit include the ACLU Foundations of Northern California and Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law and the Haitian Bridge Alliance.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ice-immigration-border-adobestock_1234297462_editorial_use_only-by-photogranary.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 06:56:21.616127

Williams landed a legal blow to the Trump administration Thursday night in a ruling on Alligator Alcatraz, banning site expansion and new detainees at the immigration detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.

The judge is giving the administration 60 days, ""once the population attrition allows for implementation of this order,"" to remove the fencing, gas, sewage, lighting, generators and ""waste receptacles that were installed to support this project.""

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) via email for additional comment Thursday night.

Why It Matters

The detention center is a focal point of President Donald Trump's second-term immigration platform. Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials have touted the facility—built by repurposing the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida—as representing the White House's hard-line stance on immigration enforcement and border security.

Critics—who include Democrats, civil rights groups and environmentalists—have said detainees at the facility are forced to endure unsafe, unsanitary and inhumane living conditions and that Alligator Alcatraz runs afoul of environmental laws.

The center was quickly created and holds an estimated 1,000 beds. The bunk beds are stacked together in wire-fenced cages. Alligator Alcatraz is expected to cost Florida about $450 million annually to operate.

What To Know

The judge's order comes on the heels of lawsuits challenging the facility's potential damage to the environment on the protected Florida Everglades.

The Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans brought a lawsuit, with environmental groups, based on their ties to the land and potential disruptions to water and food supply, according to the court ruling reviewed by Newsweek.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dismissed worries about the environmental effects of the facility.

The judge, in her ruling, prohibited ""bringing any additional persons onto the … site who were not already being detained.""

The ruling also prohibits the installation of ""industrial-style"" lighting, paving, filling, excavating, fencing or any other site expansion, including new building tents or dormitories. The order does not prohibit modifications or repairs to existing facilities for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental and other risks.

The state of Florida, which is partnering with the federal government to build the facility, filed a notice of appeal on Thursday night, shortly after the ruling was issued.

The facility has faced other legal challenges.

This week, a federal judge in Miami has dismissed part of a lawsuit brought by immigrant advocates challenging detainees' access to legal processes, handing state and federal officials a partial win.

Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.

What People Are Saying

Judge Kathleen M. Williams, referring to more than 75 years of efforts to preserve the Everglades, wrote in her ruling: ""Every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades. This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements designed to fulfil those promises.""

Eve Samples, the executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said of the ruling: ""It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government—and there are consequences for ignoring them.""

What Happens Next

The judge said she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed.

In a written answer to a question posed by the Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document.

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department’s new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews.

But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c9e6f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1994x1047+0+143/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F72%2Fbdc2b905435aae0c51ddca20affd%2Fe5a088dc6b8a4fc5b32aca63259ab9b2.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 06:56:14.483211

Federal agents and protestors pushed toward the members of Congress, “destabilizing the group,” McIver’s filings say.
McIver’s filings say an agent “forcefully shoved her backwards” as she returned inside the secured area following Baraka’s arrest.","New court filings from U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who wants a judge to dismiss a federal indictment against her, allege the charging document excludes key details of what happened at a Newark migrant jail on the day prosecutors claim McIver attacked federal officers.

The indictment, which hit McIver (D-10) with three charges of assaulting or impeding federal agents trying to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on May 9, leaves out that Baraka had left the facility when ordered, overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and obscures that McIver’s actions were part of her federally authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman, the filings say.

Moreover, McIver’s legal team says, footage from federal officers’ body-worn cameras confirms her version of events. McIver has cited the video footage in court filings, but it has yet to be made public.

“The indictment is skeletal, exaggerated, omits context, and the video evidence squarely contradicts much of it,” one of them says.

McIver was at the migrant jail, called Delaney Hall, along with two Democratic colleagues, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. Baraka, a Democrat who at the time was running for governor, had already visited the jail that week to claim that the building’s owner began housing immigrants there before city inspectors had deemed it safe to open.

The indictment alleges that when a security gate separating the Delaney Hall property from the driveway leading to it opened to let a vehicle through, the three representatives “moved quickly inside to the secured area before the gate closed” and then proceeded to an interior reception area.

McIver’s filings say the three identified themselves as members of Congress, explained they were there to “conduct congressionally authorized oversight,” and were told to remain in a secured area for about an hour. During this time, she alleges, ICE was “mobilizing its forces,” with high-level federal officials reporting to the facility, munitions-filled vehicles taking formation in the parking lot, and about 15 armed agents assembling inside the gates.

The indictment alleges this is when Baraka arrived with his security detail, told the guard at the gate that he was part of the congressional entourage, was denied entry at first, and then was “allowed to enter” the property. The guard was concerned about Baraka’s safety “amidst the crowd of protestors” outside the gate, the indictment says.

McIver’s filings say after Baraka arrived, the mayor spoke to the gate guard, who after 10 minutes then spoke to someone on his radio. After that, the guard “invited the mayor and his security detail” onto the property, her filings say.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent approached Baraka, according to the indictment, and ordered him to leave, spending about five minutes issuing “multiple warnings” that he would be arrested if he did not depart.

McIver’s filings cite video footage to say Baraka had been “standing peacefully and quietly” inside the gate for about 40 minutes when a team of agents approached him and told him to leave. Baraka said he had been invited in, was waiting for the Congress members to exit, but was “fine” to leave. He turned to walk out, and McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman then “approached the circle of agents” who were confronting Baraka.

The indictment alleges that the homeland security agent said he was going to arrest Baraka, to which McIver said, “Hell, no! Hell, no!” As the agent ordered Baraka to place his hands behind his back to be handcuffed, the indictment says, McIver and the other Congress members “surrounded” Baraka and prevented agents from handcuffing and arresting him as the mayor’s security detail escorted him off the property.

McIver’s filings say the agent’s call to arrest Baraka came after the mayor had turned to exit the jail’s property. It cites video footage that claims to show an unidentified man — “not Congresswoman McIver” — moving between the agent and Baraka. Then, McIver’s filings say, the agent allowed Baraka to leave the property.

“Alright . . . walk out,” they claim the agent said to the mayor.

McIver’s filings say federal agents then led the members of Congress toward Delaney Hall “as if they were finally going to permit the Members’ inspection.” Instead, the agent who had moments earlier said he was going to arrest Baraka took a phone call, then again said he would arrest the mayor.

“Even though he stepped out, I am going to put him in cuffs . . . per the deputy attorney general of the United States,” the agent said, according to McIver’s filings.

This is the first allegation that the order to arrest Baraka came from high-level officials with the Trump administration, and not from agents at Delaney Hall.

It’s at this moment, both sides agree, that chaos erupted.

Now outside the gate, federal agents again attempted to handcuff Baraka, according to the indictment, which says McIver “hurried” toward the agents as others yelled to “circle the mayor.” Once she was near Baraka, the indictment claims, she “slammed her forearm into the body of” one of the agents, reached out, and “tried to restrain” him by “forcibly grabbing him.”

According to McIver, when she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman saw Baraka getting arrested, they moved to the public side of the gate along with a phalanx of heavily armed and masked federal agents. She claims an unidentified man yelled out for others to “circle the mayor,” and the members of Congress and others did just that. Federal agents and protestors pushed toward the members of Congress, “destabilizing the group,” McIver’s filings say.

“The members repeatedly asserted their federal status and instructed the agents not to touch them,” one says. “Agents nevertheless pressed in on the members as the crowd formed more tightly around them.”

The indictment claims that after Baraka was arrested, McIver used “each of her forearms to forcibly strike” an agent.

McIver’s filings say video shows any contact between McIver and agents happened after an ICE agent shoved a man from behind, forcing him into the members of Congress and “sending a torrent of jostling through the crowd.” McIver’s actions were a defensive reaction to that force, her lawyers say.

McIver’s filings say an agent “forcefully shoved her backwards” as she returned inside the secured area following Baraka’s arrest. She said that force was “so egregious” she immediately said she wanted to file a complaint.

After the mayor was taken into custody, the scene calmed down, and the three House members were finally given their tour of Delaney Hall, McIver’s filing states.

The Department of Homeland Security soon after this episode posted some video footage of the scuffle on social media, slowed down to highlight McIver’s actions. McIver in her new filings says these social media posts harm her ability to have a fair trial.

“Congresswoman McIver’s contact with agents was a reactive, proportional response to what the government has apparently conceded to be a baseless, pretextual and clearly unlawful arrest in chaotic circumstances that federal agents themselves instigated,” her attorneys wrote.

Federal prosecutors dropped the trespassing charge against Baraka just days after his arrest, leading to a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case. Baraka is suing the federal government for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.

The judge said state officials never sufficiently explained why the facility needed to be in the middle of the Florida Everglades.
Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws.
The judge has said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.
Hasty construction of detention center The detention center was quickly built almost two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport in the middle of the Everglades.","MIAMI — A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Thursday halting further expansion and ordering the winding down of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" that advocates said violated environmental laws.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' injunction formalized a temporary halt she had ordered two weeks ago as witnesses continued to testify in a multiday hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case.

The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal Thursday night, shortly after the ruling was issued.

""The deportations will continue until morale improves,"" DeSantis spokesman Alex Lanfranconi said in response to the judge's ruling.

The judge said she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property. The order does not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities, ""which are solely for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site.,""

The preliminary injunction includes ""those who are in active concert or participation with"" the state of Florida or federal defendants or their officers, agents, employees,"" the judge wrote in an 82-page order.

The judge said state officials never sufficiently explained why the facility needed to be in the middle of the Florida Everglades. ""What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention camp, the State did not consider alternative locations,"" Williams said.

Judge cites decades-long efforts to preserve Everglades

Williams said her order gave the state and federal defendants time to wind down the facility so that it can undergo the required environmental assessments. She noted the three-quarters century of efforts to preserve the Everglades.

""Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,"" she wrote. ""This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.""

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars' worth of environmental restoration.

Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, called the ruling a landmark victory for the Everglades and Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected.

""It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them,"" Samples said in a statement.

Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said this isn't the first time the tribe has has to fight for its land and rights.

""We will always stand up for our culture, our sovereignty, and for the Everglades,"" Cypress said in a statement.

Attorneys for the state and federal defendants didn't immediately respond to emailed inquiries late Thursday. But they have previously argued that, although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility was entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the federal environmental law didn't apply.

The judge has said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.

Hasty construction of detention center

The detention center was quickly built almost two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport in the middle of the Everglades. It currently holds several hundred detainees but was designed to eventually hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures.

Inside the compound's large white tents, rows of bunkbeds are surrounded by chain-link cages. People held there say worms turn up in the food, toilets don't flush and flood floors with fecal waste, while mosquitoes and other insects are everywhere. At times the air conditioners abruptly shut off in the sweltering heat. Detainees are said to go days without showering or getting prescription medicine, and can only speak to lawyers and loved ones by phone.

Witnesses for the environmental groups testified during the hearing that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt had been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.

Attorneys for federal and state agencies have asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Williams ruled Thursday that her court was the proper venue.

Another federal judge in Miami dismissed part of a lawsuit earlier this week that claimed detainees were denied access to the legal system at the immigration detention center and then moved the remaining counts of the case to another court.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5730x3223+0+298/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Ff5%2Faa33f9e64e5db6bf922eb6108bf7%2Fap25234061775212.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 01:56:33.178438

It’s a so-called soft, and to date, generally a bloodless war — only about 150 years since the truly bloody first American Civil War of 1861-1865 ended.

To win his second term, Donald Trump promised to end of the Ukraine War on Day One, to lower grocery and gas prices right away, to stop inflation and to carry out retribution. Now, the picture is more clear, more cruel, more likely than not that we are racing towards a complete destruction of the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution.

Opposition political parties, the free press and vocal community leaders have not been rounded up under mass arrest — yet. It may be around the corner. I’m hoping not. But already, highly qualified and capable women and minority top military leaders were the first to go. The retribution will keep ratcheting up.

Today I don’t want to expound on predictions about the downward spiral and probable end of the Great American experiment in democracy, one that has lasted almost 250 years as the global standard. I see that we have almost completely lost the checks and balances of our form of government. It is barely limping toward its semi- quincentennial birthday unless that trajectory is stopped and reversed by a people power –People United Revolt (again, hopefully peaceful and bloodless) to restore an open and fair democracy once again by all, of all and for all.

Today I prefer to focus on the little guys like me and on my reaction to a news article I read recently. It was about ICE offering new recruits –projected to be about 80,000 strong — a $50,000 signing bonus and possible six-figure salary plus a college loan forgiveness package. These are things not offered to other Americans who do the most important work in our society for our collective safety and prosperity like first responders, nurses, teachers, caretakers of our sick and elderly, and many others. These professions can expect salary cuts, layoffs and zero federal support as they toil daily for the common weal of our nation.

In 1989 I was a 33-year-old mid-grade U.S. Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer serving my obligatory “weekend warrior” two-weeks of active duty annual tour in Argentina’s major naval base in Puerto Belgrano. One morning, as I rushed out of the officer’s club front door where I was billeted, I almost brushed elbows with an Argentine naval officer who the U.S. Embassy driver waiting for me outside identified as the “Blond Angel of Death.”

Who?

Alfredo Astiz is not a household name in the United States, but in Argentina he is the famed, handsome, blond Navy Special Forces officer who led heroically and gloriously the capture of the South Georgia Island from the British setting the stage for the Falklands/Malvinas War of 1982.

Today his story is on the internet. Astiz, now 74, has been languishing in jail for extra-judicial crimes he and his comrades-in-arms committed in their blind fervor to “save Argentina,” then under military rule. It would take almost 35 years of Argentine national anguish and debate — and international judicial wrangling –to finally bring Astiz and his cohorts to justice for their illegal and criminal acts committed under the guise of “saving our country.”

The parallels today could not be clearer from across the United States of America. There are daily reports on audio and video recordings and victims’/witnesses’ statements about the extra-judicial abuses by unidentified, combat-ready armed, masked personnel who claim to have some vague legal authority from even more questionable government or para-governmental agencies. It will happen one day — maybe not next year, not in five, 10, 20 or 30 years — but it will happen that these horrific stories of human rights abuses and deliberate violations of current laws will be pieced together. They will unmask who the perpetrators are and what they did, what laws they violated in their blind belief in leaders who will not be there to support them for their careless, illegal and inhumane actions during this current, amorphous mission to “keep America safe.”

Like Alfredo Astiz, they will be left to fend for themselves. Like Argentina then, the United States now is struggling with itself. Like Argentina in 1976, we may even lose our democracy, but it will be back — like Argentina did, fighting valiantly, for 35 years under great pain, to restore its democracy.

If they are 22, 32 or 42 now, the potential new ICE recruits will be only 57, 67 or 77 in 2060. Want an unprecedented, irresistible $50,000 signing bonus, potential six-figure salary, loan forgiveness plan just to fight America’s very open, clumsy, notorious, not-so-secret Dirty War?

I would resist. And just say no.

After three terrifying weeks at an ICE detention in Texas, Sarah Shaw and her son, Isaac, are back home in Washington.

Shaw, a WFSE member and Echo Glen employee, works with youth in Washington’s juvenile rehabilitation system. She said her work experience has given her empathy for people in the corrections system—something she wished her and Isaac were shown more of.

“I work with juvenile rehabilitation,” Shaw said. “I understand what it’s like when you have to do your job. But you can be kind and compassionate and empathetic to people while you do your job.”

Sarah’s experience at the border left her emotionally shattered in the presence of her son.

“We didn’t have space alone to decompress and process the situation,” Shaw said. “Isaac saw me have multiple breakdowns at the border. I was having panic attacks and couldn’t sleep, and the psychiatrist tried putting me on an anti-psychotic medicine.”

Shaw’s ordeal ended much quicker than most of the families held at the Dilley Detention Center, who make money on every person detained.

“I was lucky,” Shaw said. “There were some families that had been there 70 days or more. I was lucky I had family and friends to fill up my commissary funds. Each phone call I made was ten to twenty dollars. It’s heartbreaking that the longer someone stays there, the more funds [the facility] gets for that.”

Shaw’s attorney, Minda A. Thorward, believes that the only reason she was paroled so quickly was because of the media attention her case gathered. She referred to the case as a “grotesque” violation of rights and “legally sanctioned kidnapping.”

WFSE Members Respond in Thousands

WFSE worked closely with federal and state officials to secure Shaw’s release; Shaw’s friend Victoria Besancon noted that WFSE’s demand for Sarah’s release was the first call to action or media release.

WFSE also advocated for Shaw to receive shared leave to keep her job. Our members came together to help donate to her GoFundMe, which has raised over $60,000 to go towards Sarah’s legal expenses.

Shaw is a dedicated public servant who has done untold good for Washingtonians with her work at Echo Glen, rehabilitating some of the most at-risk youth in our corrections system for years. Her apprehension at the border was a gross misuse of power that harmed the communities she serves and Washington as a whole.

Our state workers are the force that keeps Washington running. Workers like Sarah Shaw deserve the respect and admiration of all Americans, not to be traumatized to help make money for privately owned detention centers.

Shaw’s unfair treatment shines a light on why WFSE’s executive board passed a resolution in February declaring WFSE’s commitment to being “a safe and welcoming place for all members and their families regardless of their immigration status.”

WFSE continues to stand up for the public servants who keep our state and country running and stands against the anti-worker billionaires and politicians who are using political theatre to destroy the services we rely on daily. This includes ICE’s massive budget, which was funded by huge cuts to public services Americans rely on.

County Commissioner Gary Hendrickx says he looks at detention centers with ""concern"", writing in a statement, ""On one hand the jobs and economic stimulus would benefit the region.","APPLETON, Minn — New documents from within the Trump Administration highlight its plan to open more immigrant detention centers by the end of the year.

One of those could be the long-closed Prairie Correctional Facility in Appleton, Minnesota, the only private prison in the state. Appleton is about 150 miles west of Minneapolis.

It's owner, CoreCivic, says some staff remain on site and help maintain the building that can house about 1,600 people.

In a statement to KARE 11 Thursday, a CoreCivic spokesperson wrote, ""We continue to explore opportunities with our government partners for which this site could be a viable solution.""

The facility closed in 2010, but according to lifelong resident, Edward Massee, he's skeptical it may ever reopen.

""The more recent news is probably the best traction that we’ve seen or heard,"" said Massee, who's also the town banker.

He admits the prison's closure was a detriment to the community and supports its reopening to revive the local economy.

""It shuts down your housing market, the grocery store, on down the line,"" said Massee. ""The ripple effect was felt tremendously.""

Trump's plan was confirmed this week by Washington Post reporter Doug MacMillan. He says the administration wants to double the number of available beds from 50,000 to 100,000 and is eyeing opening facilities in Minnesota, North Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Indiana.

""Rather than have to move people around the country a lot, I think they do want to have more localized detention centers where they can increase the number of interior arrests in the Minnesota area and have somewhere to keep them while they’re waiting for deportation,"" said MacMillan,

Congress recently approved $45 billion for detention centers over the next five years, according to MacMillan. He says that's more than the last three administrations combined.

""Looking at that kind of slice of spending tells you a lot about how serious they are about their plans and how much support they have in Washington,"" said MacMillan.

Since the Prairie Correctional Facility closed, the state legislature banned operating private prisons, but there's no federal law against that.

Appleton City Administrator John Olinger says right now, the city is not in talks with CoreCivic or ICE. In a statement, Olinger writes, ""We have also heard the rumors and confirmed with our contact at CoreCivic that they do not have a contract with ICE, but are pursuing a contract.""

Swift County also confirms it has not been contacted by CoreCivic or ICE.

County Commissioner Gary Hendrickx says he looks at detention centers with ""concern"", writing in a statement, ""On one hand the jobs and economic stimulus would benefit the region. On the other hand treatment of detainees creates a polarization effect in our society. My goal is that all detainees are treated with dignity and respect.""

Appleton Mayor Justin Koepp told KARE 11 reporter Jennifer Hoff, ""We wish it would open,"" when referring to the prison. He said it would generate up to 500 jobs as far away as Willmar and Aberdeen.

MacMillan says that housing inmates can cost, on average, $150 a night, per person. Depending on their size, facilities are generating tens of millions of dollars a year. CoreCivic and The GEO Group are two of the biggest corporations that invest in prisons.

MacMillan's reporting found that, together, they are expected to double their annual income to $2 billion a year under Trump's new plan.

""I don’t disagree with it, one way or the other, why the people are here, it’s just more of a benefit to Appleton to help these jobs and help a struggling community,"" said Massee about the detainees that could be housed in the city.

Trump claimed that a crime crisis required his Republican administration’s intervention in the Democratic-led city this month, brushing aside statistics that showed the problem was already waning. However, immigration enforcement appears to be a priority, as more than a third of people arrested in the last two weeks were in the country illegally, according to the White House.

Hundreds of federal agents and National Guard soldiers have surged into Washington, leaving some residents on edge and creating tense confrontations in the streets.

A day care center was partially closed Thursday when staff became afraid to go to work because they heard about federal agents nearby. An administrator asked parents to keep their children at home if possible.

Other day cares have stopped taking kids on daily walks because of fears about encountering law enforcement.

Trump visits cops and troops

The White House said there have been 630 arrests, including 251 people who are in the country illegally, since Aug. 7, when Trump began surging federal agents into the city. Trump has been ratcheting up the pressure since then, seizing control of the D.C. police department on Aug. 11 and deploying more National Guard troops, mostly from Republican-led states.

On Thursday evening, Trump visited with officers and troops at a U.S. Park Police facility in the latest show of force from the White House.

“We’re not playing games,” he said.

Trump suggested that operations in the city could be drawn out and serve as a model for others around the country.

“We’re going to make it safe, and we’re going to go on to other places, but we’re going to stay here for a while,” he said.

Soldiers have been largely stationed in downtown areas, such as monuments on the National Mall and transit stations. However, federal agents are operating more widely through the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the proliferation of traffic checkpoints Thursday.

“The surge of federal officers is allowing for different types of deployments, more frequent types of deployments, like checkpoints,” Bowser said.

A crowd of people gathered outside a municipal office building to protest Trump’s crackdown, waving signs and cheering speakers who denounced the president’s plans. Their numbers swelled into the hundreds until police closed off nearby streets. When the rally ended, many remained to dance and listen to music.

In other neighborhoods Thursday evening, residents banged pots and pans on rooftops, front steps and street corners.

Not a normal traffic stop

On Thursday morning, as Martin Romero rode through Washington’s Rock Creek Park on his way to a construction job in Virginia, he saw police on the road up ahead. He figured it was a normal traffic stop, but it wasn’t.

Romero, 41, said U.S. Park Police were telling pickup trucks with company logos to pull over, reminding them that commercial vehicles weren’t allowed on park roads. They checked for licenses and insurance information, and then U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came over.

Romero said there were two agents on one side of his truck and three on the other. He started to get nervous as the agents asked where they were from and whether they were in the country illegally.

“We just came here to work,” Romero said afterwards. “We aren’t doing anything bad.”

Two people in his truck were detained and the agents didn’t give a reason, he said. He also saw three other people taken from other vehicles.

“I feel really worried because they took two of our guys,” he said. “They wouldn’t say where they’re taking them or if they’ll be able to come back.”

Romero said he called his boss, who told him to just head home. They wouldn’t be working today.

Enrique Martinez, a supervisor at the construction company, came to the scene afterwards. He pondered whether to call families of the detained men.

“This has never happened to our company before,” Martinez said. “I’m not really sure what to do.”

Checkpoints are legal, to a point

The Supreme Court has upheld the use of law enforcement and government checkpoints for specific purposes, such as policing the border and identifying suspected drunk drivers.

But there are restrictions on that authority, especially when it comes to general crime control. Jeffrey Bellin, a former prosecutor in Washington and professor at Vanderbilt Law School who specializes in criminal law and procedures, said the Constitution doesn’t allow “the government to be constantly checking us and stopping to see if we’re up to any criminal activity.”

He said checkpoints for a legally justifiable purpose — like checking for driver’s licenses and registrations — cannot be used as “subterfuge” or a pretext for stops that would otherwise not be allowed. And though the court has affirmed the use of checkpoints at the border, and even some distance away from it, to ask drivers about immigration status, Bellin said it was unlikely the authority would extend to Washington.

Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at Georgia State College of Law, said the seemingly “arbitrary” and intrusive nature of the checkpoints in the capital could leave residents feeling aggrieved.

“Some of the things could be entirely constitutional and fine, but at the same time, the way that things are unfolding, people are suspicious — and I think for good reason,” he said.

Lilly Burchfield, 25, said she’s seen people in her neighborhood come out of their homes to yell at federal agents.

“It feels like we’re all coming together as a community and everyone that I’ve talked to has been outraged by what’s happening,” she said.

From Los Angeles to D.C.

There are few places in the country that have been unaffected by Trump’s deportation drive, but his push into D.C. is shaping into something more sustained, similar to what has unfolded in the Los Angeles area since early June.

In Los Angeles, immigration officers — working with the Border Patrol and other federal agencies — have been a near-daily presence at Home Depots, car washes and other highly visible locations.

In a demonstration of how enforcement has affected routines, the bishop of San Bernardino, California, formally excused parishioners of their weekly obligation to attend Mass after immigration agents detained people on two parish properties.

Immigration officials have been an unusually public presence, sending horse patrols to the city’s famed MacArthur Park and appearing outside California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s news conference last week on congressional redistricting. Authorities said an agent fired at a moving vehicle last week after the driver refused to roll down his window during an immigration stop.

The National Guard and Marines were previously in the city for weeks on an assignment to maintain order amid protests.

A federal judge blocked the administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops in Southern California but authorities have vowed to keep the pressure on.

Lawyers for Pina released a statement praising the judge’s decision later on Thursday and calling for the Trump administration to follow federal procedure for appointing US attorneys.
Then, on March 24, he announced she would be his pick for US attorney for the New Jersey district.","A federal judge has ruled that lawyer Alina Habba was unlawfully appointed to the role of acting United States attorney for the District of New Jersey

Thursday’s decision from District Judge Matthew Brann was a rebuke to the administration of President Donald Trump, who has sought to keep Habba, his former personal lawyer, in the role despite a previous court decision replacing her.

“Faced with the question of whether Ms Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not,” Brann wrote.

Brann accused the Trump administration of using “a novel series of legal and personnel moves” to keep Habba in her role as US attorney.

But, given the fact that Habba has not been officially confirmed to the position by the US Senate, Brann decided that her actions since July 1 “may be declared void”.

Brann, however, put his decision on hold pending a likely appeal from the Trump administration.

The challenge against Habba’s continued role as US attorney came from defendants in cases she was pursuing.

Two, Julien Giraud Jr and Julien Giraud III, were charged with drug and firearm-related offences. A third, Cesar Humberto Pina, was accused of laundering drug proceeds and participating in a “multi-million-dollar Ponzi-like investment fraud scheme”.

Lawyers for Pina released a statement praising the judge’s decision later on Thursday and calling for the Trump administration to follow federal procedure for appointing US attorneys.

“Prosecutors wield enormous power, and with that comes the responsibility to ensure they are qualified and properly appointed,” lawyers Abbe David Lowell and Gerald Krovatin wrote in the statement.

“We appreciate the thoroughness of the court’s opinion, and its decision underscores that this Administration cannot circumvent the congressionally mandated process for confirming US Attorney appointments.”

Trump clashes with judicial branch

Thursday’s court decision is likely to continue the power clash between President Trump and the judiciary, whom he has accused of being politically biased against him and his allies.

While Habba awaits a confirmation hearing before the US Senate, she has served in the US attorney position on an interim basis.

But such interim appointments are capped at a period of 120 days. Continuing beyond that time span requires approval from a panel of judges in the district.

The panel, however, declined Habba’s bid to stay in the role on July 22. It named her second-in-command, career prosecutor Desiree Grace, to replace her as US attorney.

But the Trump administration swiftly moved to reject the judges’ decision. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace and said Habba would continue in her role regardless of the July 22 court order.

“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges,” Bondi wrote on social media.

The Justice Department, under Trump, has sought to retain term-capped interim US attorneys elsewhere as well.

But Habba’s handling of her position has drawn particular scrutiny, as has her close relationship with the president.

Habba was an early appointment to Trump’s second term. In December, just weeks after winning the 2024 presidential election, Trump revealed he would bring her into the White House as a counsellor for his administration.

Then, on March 24, he announced she would be his pick for US attorney for the New Jersey district.

Previously, Habba has represented Trump as a personal lawyer in several civil cases.

While she won one defamation suit brought against Trump by former reality TV contestant Summer Zervos, she lost two high-profile cases: a defamation suit brought by writer E Jean Carroll and a civil fraud case led by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump is currently appealing both of those decisions.

Questions surrounding Habba’s leadership

Since taking on the role of interim US attorney, Habba told a podcaster that she hoped to help “turn New Jersey red” – an indication she may use her traditionally nonpartisan position for partisan aims.

She has also led probes and prosecutions that critics denounced as politically motivated. In one instance, she opened an investigation into New Jersey’s Democratic Governor Phil Murphy over his immigration policies.

In another, she charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing after he attempted to join several Congress members on a tour of the Delaney Hall immigration detention facility.

Those charges were later dropped, and a member of Habba’s office was rebuked in court. “An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool,” Judge Andre Espinosa told the prosecutor.

Baraka has since filed a civil complaint accusing Habba of “subjecting him to false arrest and malicious prosecution”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-05-24T153213Z_1242448577_RC2EOEAOGK10_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-WEST-POINT-1755808627.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-21 21:56:33.547040

(FOX 5/KUSI) — A recent arrest carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents near Park Dale Lane Elementary School in Encinitas has sparked community concern — and now, ICE is pushing back against what it calls “misleading” narratives.

The FOX 5/KUSI video above shows the arrest of a man by ICE agents in Encinitas

The arrest took place Wednesday morning during school drop-off hours, just two blocks from the school’s campus. A video circulating on social media shows agents from ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) detaining a man later identified as an undocumented migrant from Guatemala with a final order of removal dating back to 2017.

Parents and community members expressed outrage over the arrest’s timing and proximity to a school zone, with some emphasizing how “dramatic” the encounter was and how it induces trauma for those involved — in this case, even a child that was present during the arrest.

Some local leaders, including State Senator Catherine Blakespear, promptly denounced the incident as “cruel and inhuman.” In a follow-up statement on Thursday, the senator went as far as calling the situation “horrifying.”

“We should continue to demand that our federal law enforcement identify themselves and provide lawful warrants upon request, stay away from sensitive areas like schools and follows the highest standards of the law,” said Blakespear on social media.

As for ICE, a San Diego-area official has released a formal statement in response to community outcry, pushing back on accusations that enforcement occurred on or near school grounds and placing responsibility for the child’s involvement on the family.

According to local Field Office Director Patrick Divver, “ICE San Diego finds it unfortunate that an individual chose to insert a child into an active law enforcement situation, and that official statements were made before the facts of this case were fully known.”

According to the agency, the detained man was the “sole occupant of the vehicle” at the time of the stop. ICE contends that his alleged spouse arrived separately from a direction opposite the school, bringing the child with her and “interjecting herself and the young child into the scene.”

Divver said when agents conducted the immigration enforcement stop, the man later arrested was the sole occupant of the vehicle. He stated, “During the vehicle stop, the illegal aliens’ alleged spouse responded to the area in a separate vehicle with a young child in the backseat from the opposite direction of the school and then proceeded to interject herself and the young child into the scene. These actions are shameful and not to mention dangerous.”

ICE also emphasized that the arrest did not take place on school property and occurred out of view from the campus.

“Claims that ICE conducted enforcement on school grounds are patently false,” Divver said. “ICE San Diego has not conducted enforcement at schools, and suggestions to the contrary mislead the public and create unnecessary fear.”

The agency reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing immigration law “while ensuring the safety of the community and our officers.”

In response, the Encinitas City Council added the incident as an emergency item for discussion to explore possible responses. As it stands, the council’s next steps include:

Submitting a Freedom of Information Act to document ICE operations in Encinitas

Exploring how to establish safe zones

Exploring joining lawsuits challenging ICE operations

Forming a community communications group (text chain)

Sending letters to federal agencies protesting actions

Requesting federal partners to be present to respond to questions from city and community

Investigating ability to limit mask wearing by ICE

Exploring other legal mechanisms available to the city

As public pressure mounts, community leaders are expected to push for clearer policies governing federal enforcement activity near schools, with some calling for broader sanctuary protections at the local level.

“It’s always horrifying when someone is brutalized by really anyone, but then specifically, with all the fear going on with ICE enforcement and immigration enforcement, it’s unfortunately becoming more and more common,” said Tiffany Wang, an attorney with Innovation Law Lab in Albuquerque.

We have seen videos of people being arrested by ICE agents across New Mexico. The newest video shows what appears to be another one in Aztec on Monday.

The video shows a group of people wearing vests that have “police” and “ICE” printed on them. They bang on the driver’s side window of a vehicle, as the man inside yells for his kids. Then, you can see one of them using a sledgehammer to break a window to get the man out.

“It’s not right that people have to live in fear. People are terrified of leaving their homes and that’s not OK, regardless of the amount of force that’s being used,” Wang said.

She wants people need to know what to do, if this happens to them.

“Making sure that there is a plan for picking up your children from school, or who’s going to care for those children. If you have any pets who are going to care for them, like any kinds of information for, you know, your bank accounts, just so that in the case that you are detained you can have that kind of information. Or someone else can have that information and to make sure that all your affairs are taken care of,” Wang said.

Wang wants you to know what you can say no to.

“ICE should not be able to enter your home, or, you know, be violating your spaces unless they have a judicial warrant. We know that there are times when things like this are happening, where people’s cars are getting broken into, there’s this excessive violence being used,” Wang said.

Even though New Mexico has sanctuary cities, the state is not allowed to intervene and stop immigration enforcement.

We reached out to ICE to get more information on this incident. They sent this statement Thursday:

On Aug. 18, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officers arrested Jorge Martin Ortiz-Rosalez, 34, an ICE fugitive and criminal illegal alien from Mexico, in Aztec, New Mexico, during a targeted enforcement operation. Ortiz-Rosalez illegally entered the United States in April 2006 through El Paso, Texas, and was ordered removed by an immigration judge on Sept. 26, 2012.

Ortiz-Rosalez has a criminal history that includes multiple arrests and convictions. In 2011, Durango Police Department officers arrested him twice—once for violating a court protection order and later for driving while intoxicated, for which he was convicted in 2012. In 2015, he was again convicted of violating a protection order.

“Ortiz-Rosalez attempted to evade arrest by speeding away from our officers and putting the passengers in his vehicle as well as other innocent bystanders on the road in danger. It’s important to note that failing to comply with ICE officers’ commands or resisting arrest, will not be tolerated and will not deter ICE officers from taking dangerous criminals off the street,” said Marisa A. Flores, acting field office director of ERO El Paso. “Our officers are trained to resolve dangerous situations utilizing established de-escalation policies, while prioritizing the safety of everyone involved.”

During the Aug. 18 operation, ICE officers observed Ortiz-Rosalez leave his residence and attempted a vehicle stop. The illegal alien did not stop and instead fled at high speed, endangering other drivers. Officers later encountered him in a grocery store parking lot, where he refused verbal commands to exit his vehicle, forcing officers to remove him from his vehicle.

They also want the Trump administration stop conducting “indiscriminate” raids targeting immigrant workers.

“The shameful use of a military base for immigration detention is a disgrace to the values of our city and our country,” said Samantha Singleton, policy director of Border Network for Human Rights.

“Americans from all walks of life are watching,” she said. “They see neighbors and loved ones disappear in unmarked vehicles, they see the devastation of family separation, they see billions of taxpayer dollars being spent terrorizing immigrant communities while families across the nation struggle to put food on the table. …”

BNHR and several other organizations from West Texas and southern New Mexico on Thursday gathered on a sidewalk in Central El Paso to protest the recent opening of the East Montana Detention Facility. Forty activists lined the side wall of the Estrella del Paso building, some holding a large sign demanding to “Close the camps.”

Massive canvas tents at Fort Bliss already are housing 1,000 migrants – all of them adult males. The Trump administration plans to install more tents in the next year or so until capacity reaches 5,000 – which would make it the largest migrant detention facility in the country.

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, toured East Montana Detention Facility on Thursday morning and reported to advocates she was told half of the detainees did not have a criminal record. That’s in contrast to recent comments by GOP lawmakers that only “criminal aliens” and those with final deportation orders would be housed in Fort Bliss.

“There’s lack of access and transparency as to who’s detained there,” said Becka Sheff, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico. “From what we are aware, the people at Fort Bliss come from all over the country … California and Florida, people still fighting their cases; they don’t have a final order” of deportation.

She said citizens of countries as diverse as Vietnam, Cuba and Venezuela are at East Montana.

Sheff and others called for accountability from ICE including access to the new detention center and to detainees.

Border Report reached out to ICE for comment. The agency sent a statement re-stating the need for additional detention center bed space and how the Fort Bliss “soft-sided” facility is comparable to any other detention center.

“The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” the statement said.

Estrella del Paso Executive Director Melissa Lopez said El Paso has not been immune to workplace raids and arrests of immigrants in places ICE previously did not go into, such as courthouses.

“We had a circumstance recently in which one of the (immigration) judges pulled in several individuals into one hearing and summarily dismissed their cases without taking into consideration their circumstances,” Lopez said. “And then as soon as all of those individuals walked out of court, they were arrested.”

Lopez said she witnessed a workplace raid at a business in the same block as Estrella del Paso. “We had a number of federal law enforcement, especially immigration officers, surrounding our building,” which raised concerns about possible monitoring of the nonprofit’s activities, she said. It was a workplace raid “literally happening in our neighborhood.”

We’re going to do what you’re doing with law enforcement, and very importantly, also, we’re going to physically do it,” he told the agents, officers and troops. “We’re going back to Congress for some money, and we’re going to redo a lot of the pavement, a lot of the medians, a lot of the graffitis, all coming off real fast. It’s going to come down real fast.

“And when people come in from the airport all the way to the Capitol, the White House, or any place else they go, and they say, Well, this place is spotless, so we’re doing that,” Trump added. “You got to be strong, you got to be tough. You got to do your job. Whatever it takes to do your job. You got to do your job.”

The president contended “the crime numbers are way down” inside the district, calling it a model for possible similar actions in other major American cities.

“I feel very safe now, and I’m hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks it’s going to be, within two weeks, it’s going to be … even far superior,” he said, dropping a period of time that has become a verbal crutch when he discusses his plans. “I just wanted to thank you for what you’re doing.”

As for how long the D.C. operation and federalization of the city’s policing could last, the president said, “We’re going to stay here for a while.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House deputy chief of staff for domestic policy Stephen Miller joined Trump in the massive sedan known as “The Beast.” Bondi has been in charge of the District’s police department for 10 days, and Miller is the linchpin behind Trump’s hardline immigration and policing policies. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum joined the president in Anacostia.

Virginia’s senior senator, Democrat Mark Warner, on Thursday wrote on X that “if Trump really cared about the safety of the residents of DC, he probably would have started by placing more pressure on the Republican House to fix a tiny logistical hiccup that cost DC $1 billion — hurting local police,” adding: “Instead, DC still isn’t able to access its tax dollars.”

‘We’re going to do a job’

Trump made the stunning announcement earlier Thursday of the patrol during a call-in segment to a conservative radio program, telling host Todd Starnes, “I’m going to be going out tonight, I think, with the police and with the military, of course.

“So we’re going to do a job,” Trump added.

Trump has annoyed Democrats during two terms and three campaigns by declaring himself the nation’s top law enforcement officer. While technically true, most presidents have delegated that role and moniker to their attorneys general.

The street spectacle came after Trump on Aug. 11 used a rare appearance in the White House briefing room to announce he would use his office’s powers to take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department and deploy National Guard troops around the nation’s capital.

The president that day called violent crime, car thefts, homelessness and uncleanliness in the District “out of control,” adding from a lectern with the presidential seal affixed to its front: “We’re going to take our capital back.”

“We’re not going to let it happen anymore. … We’re not going to take it,” he said, contending the murder and violent crime rate in D.C. is higher than in some of the “worst places on earth,” mentioning Bogota, Colombia and Mexico City, Mexico.

On Tuesday, Trump called into Fox News and declared he had made the district “just an incredible place in, in literally four days.”

“I have friends that say they’re going out to dinner,” he added a day after he claimed to reporters to have received phone calls from friends who live in D.C. but had not dined at a restaurant in several years.

Trump and his top aides assert that D.C.’s violent crime rate is at an all-time high. But a closer look at MPD and Justice Department numbers shows violent crimes have been falling over the last 12 months — though that means, by definition, they mostly have returned to still-high, pre-spike levels.

During his Aug. 11 news conference, Trump assessed the state of the district this way: “It’s becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness. And we’re getting rid of the slums too. We have slums here. We’re getting rid of them. I know it’s not politically correct.

“You’ll say, ‘Oh, so terrible.’ No, we’re getting rid of the slums where they live. Caravans of masked youth rampage through city streets at all times of the day. They’re on ATVs, motorbikes. They travel pretty well,” he added. “Entire neighborhoods are now under emergency curfews.”

MPD officers have assisted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents on immigration-related arrests, an issue Trump as recently as this week told reporters helped propel him to two White House terms.

Trump’s D.C. policing takeover and the subsequent sometimes heavy-handed moves by local and federal officers have outraged many congressional Democrats.

“Every day Washingtonians are confronted with new outrages from Trump’s unwanted and unjustified occupation of D.C., including arrests using excessive force that put people in unnecessary danger,” Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said in a Wednesday statement. “Many of these encounters have been captured on video taken by bystanders or journalists, and I cannot help but wonder what we are not seeing because it is not caught on video.”

The president has called on Congress, once it finishes its annual summer recess, to repeal the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act and pass a “crime bill” to end practices like “no-cash bail” and provide more crime-fighting resources and flexibility.

Awkwardly, some of Trump’s parting words for the personnel, who have been making sometimes-physical arrests and having negative interactions with D.C. residents: “Have a good time, everybody.”

Rather than walking the streets, the White House called a “lid” at 6:21 p.m., meaning Trump was in for the night.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-file.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 20:56:32.716696

SAN FRANCISCO, CA., 8/21/25 — Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday filed California’s 39th lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging new immigration enforcement requirements it placed on federal funding for crime victims.

States were set to receive more than $1.2 billion in federal crime victim funding this year, with California expected to claim $165 million. But last month, the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Victims for Crime announced that states must agree to support and assist the Department of Homeland Security with federal immigration enforcement in order to access those funds.

Some states view that condition as unworkable and the potential loss of funding could be the second significant hit this year from the Trump administration to California programs that support crime victims. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department slashed grants for violence prevention and victim service programs that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million.

“Congress has never put civil immigration enforcement conditions on this funding because it has nothing to do with immigration. This is a brazen abuse of the president’s power,” Bonta said at a Monday press conference about the latest lawsuit.

California and 20 other states are suing the Trump administration over the potential cut in the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The states want the courts to prevent the Department of Justice from implementing the new rules.

The contested funding for crime victims supports expenses such as emergency shelter, sexual assault medical support, compensation for lost wages and funeral expenses.

The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by going around Congress on how a program it created should be funded. The lawsuit also alleges that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that is the subject of most of the lawsuits California has filed against the White House. The act says that a federal agency needs to follow procedures and explain its rationale for changing a policy.

The states allege that the Department of Justice “arbitrarily relied on immigration-related factors that Congress did not authorize it to rely on in allocating federal grant monies to support victims.”

Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said during the press conference that the Department of Justice’s new rules go against his values. He gave the example of a child who’s the victim of sexual assault being interviewed at a child advocacy center. “One question that should not be asked is whether that child is in this country lawfully or unlawfully,” he said.

The crime act fund was signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The law emerged after a report from Reagan’s 1982 Task Force on Victims of Crime said that the “neglect of crime victims is a national disgrace,” according to Monday’s lawsuit. Among the report’s recommendations was to “enact legislation to provide federal funding to assist state crime victim compensation programs.”

In May, California filed two other lawsuits against the Trump administration for tying immigration enforcement to transportation and counter-terrorism funding, affecting billions of dollars in federal support.

“Withholding these funds will retraumatize crime victims and survivors who are trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives,” Weiser said.
“And this stunning action by the administration does not make communities safer.” In 2024 alone, Colorado’s Office for Victims Programs received over $21 million in funding from Victims of Crime Acts grants.
To continue receiving the funding, Colorado must comply with immigration efforts by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.","(The Center Square) — Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has joined a 20-state coalition and Washington, D.C., suing the Trump administration over restrictions it has put on Victims of Crime Act grants.

The funding in jeopardy, which has already been appropriated by Congress, totals more than a billion dollars.

The Justice Department has declared that states will not be able to access Victims of Crime Act funding unless they agree to support the administration’s immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit called these “unprecedented conditions.”

“Tying congressionally mandated funds for crime victim support to immigration conditions not authorized by Congress is wrong and an illegal overreach by the Justice Department,” said Weiser.

The Victims of Crime Act was first enacted in 1984. Administered by the U.S. Department of Justice, the grant programs help fund a wide variety of programs including victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and medical, funeral and burial expenses.

“Withholding these funds will retraumatize crime victims and survivors who are trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives,” Weiser said. “And this stunning action by the administration does not make communities safer.”

In 2024 alone, Colorado’s Office for Victims Programs received over $21 million in funding from Victims of Crime Acts grants. Funding is distributed to states based on fixed statutory formulas.

To continue receiving the funding, Colorado must comply with immigration efforts by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Colorado is joined on the lawsuit by New Jersey, California, Delaware, Illinois, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Colorado has been a critical player in the coalition of Democratic states fighting against the many cuts pushed by the Republicans. So far, Colorado has joined or filed 35 lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Currently Colorado and its capital city Denver have been under scrutiny for their so-called sanctuary city policies, which limits their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Notably, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston joined four other sanctuary city mayors in testifying before a U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform committee in March on the issue, as previously reported by The Center Square.

More recently, the U.S. Department of Justice released a list of “states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Colorado and Denver were both on that list.

“Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” said U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

Weiser is confident the lawsuit will be successful.

“We sued in the first Trump administration when it attempted a similar tactic with law enforcement grants, and we won,” he said. “I’m confident we’ll win again.”",,N,,2025-08-21 19:57:07.608809

What we know",Bret Pallotto,,,,,https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/article311779674.html,"It would mark the first known ICE activity in Centre County during President Donald Trump’s second term.

Centre County Rapid Response Network has trained more than 85 volunteers to verify and monitor ICE activity in the area.
They have a 24-hour hotline 814-264-4626, but until this week the group had only dispelled rumors about ICE activity.","Immigrant rights advocates said Thursday that 26 men were taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody this week on highways in Centre County.

The tally has not been confirmed by the department, which has not responded to daily emails from the Centre Daily Times since Tuesday. It would mark the first known ICE activity in Centre County during President Donald Trump’s second term.

A coalition of four advocacy groups— Centre County Rapid Response Network, People’s Defense Front, Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity and the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition — said officers first stopped workers about 7 a.m. Tuesday on Interstate 99 near Bellefonte as they were traveling to the construction site at Mount Nittany Medical Center.

Additional workers were stopped about 8 a.m. Tuesday on Eagle Valley Road near Interstate 80, the groups said. The Centre County Rapid Response Network said a witness reported a handful of officers detained three Latino men.

“As this incident did not occur on Mount Nittany Health property, we do not have information to share and will not be providing further comment,” the health system said in a statement Thursday.

State Rep. Paul Takac, D-College Township, said Tuesday that he is still attempting to gather information about what exactly happened. He said the workers are believed to have been staying at hotels in his district.

“We’re still in the information gathering stage and we want to make sure that this is a fair and just process,” Takac said. “That they get due process of law and that we continue to protect the citizens of Centre County as well as the rights of everyone involved.”

Questions remain about arrests

In the days leading up to the men being taken into custody, the advocacy groups said workers reported that officers were believed to be surveilling the construction site and following workers after their shifts.

“From this surveillance, ICE was able to target workers on their way to work,” the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition said in a news release.

They identified the men as nationals from Mexico and the Central American countries of Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. It was not immediately clear where the men may be detained.

The Rapid Response Network said it has identified all of the men, but declined to share their names publicly. The groups believe at least some are detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County, as well as facilities in Clinton and Pike counties.

During Thursday’s press conference, advocates repeatedly said Pennsylvania State Police assisted ICE — a claim the agency has flatly denied multiple times in conversations with the CDT.

Trooper Jacob Rhymestine said state police at Rockview had “no involvement with any ICE activity in Centre County.” The officers captured in a widely shared video did not appear to be wearing the state police uniform.

In addition, state police policy says enforcement of federal immigration laws is exclusively handled by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Troopers are prohibited from questioning people about their immigration status unless it directly relates to a criminal investigation.

State police spokesman Myles Snyder later told the CDT multiple troopers stopped along the highway where ICE was operating, but left after being told everything was OK. The troopers were not involved in the operation, Snyder said.

He further said troopers have an obligation, if practical, to check with any law enforcement agency stopped on the shoulder of a highway.

After receiving confirmation from Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office, Takac said state police were alerted ahead of time that there would be ICE activity, but they did not participate in the traffic stops or enforcement action.

Connor Lewis, chapter president of Seven Mountains AFL-CIO, strongly criticized the use of federal officers to apprehend workers on their way to build an expansion at a medical facility, calling it “obscene” and likening detention centers to modern day gulags.

He also described the officers as “thugs and cowards.”

“Every worker, regardless of documentation status, has the right to be safe on the job, and on their way to and from work,” Lewis said in a statement. “... Those workers will find themselves incarcerated in inhumane conditions without the benefit of due process. Meanwhile, the contractors that exploited them, and who have been investigated numerous times for worker abuses, will count their profits and move on to the next job.”

The labor union advocated for all elected officials that represent Centre County to ensure the workers’ rights are upheld, and that federal officers are held accountable for any abuses of their power.

Lewis also endorsed a protest planned for 2 p.m. Sunday in Philipsburg, about three miles away from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

“For-profit concentration camps paid for by taxpayer dollars have no place in a free society,” Lewis said. “The time for equivocation is over, and we’ll remember the choices that leaders make in this critical moment.”

What else is known about ICE activity in Centre County?

Some Centre County residents have been concerned about potential enforcement actions since Trump began his second term.

Rumors of ICE activity in the State College Area School District spread online in January, but the claims were quickly denied by the district. At Penn State, at least 25 international student visas were revoked only to later be reinstated by the Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security in May labeled Centre County and State College as “sanctuary jurisdictions,” a classification that has no firm criteria but generally accused them of defying federal immigration law. After widespread criticism, the list was removed days later. Neither the county nor the borough were included on a list released this month.

Centre County Rapid Response Network has trained more than 85 volunteers to verify and monitor ICE activity in the area. They have a 24-hour hotline 814-264-4626, but until this week the group had only dispelled rumors about ICE activity.

The proposed tent camp—projected to cost taxpayers $1.26 billion—could hold up to 5,000 people, exposing them to inhumane conditions.

More than 700 contract workers are already stationed at Fort Bliss. That’s proof Trump is putting his friends first and turning detention into a payday.

The Seneca County Sheriff's Office has not responded to a request for comment.","A lawsuit filed against the Geauga County Sheriff's Office regarding public records related to detaining immigrants will be heard by the state’s high court.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed lawsuits against the sheriff’s offices in Geauga and Seneca counties in May and August, respectively. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the suit against Geauga County can move forward.

“It's important to understand the government works for us. Public records belong to the public. We're only asking for records that we're entitled clearly to receive,” said Freda Levenson, the ACLU of Ohio’s chief legal officer.

The ACLU of Ohio requested documents regarding contracts and communication with U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement.

“Specifically, we want to know how the government is detaining immigrants, the location, the conditions, the cost, the numbers. We've heard of appalling conditions in these facilities. We have humanitarian concerns, legal concerns, financial concerns,” Levenson said. “Taxpayers, residents of Seneca County have a right to know how their law enforcement officers are being deployed, how their facilities are being utilized, how the money is being spent.”

Six jails in Ohio currently serve as detention centers for ICE, including the Geauga County Safety Center and the Seneca County Jail, both of which are managed by the sheriff’s offices.

The other four jails in Ohio that hold ICE detainees are the Butler County Sheriff’s Office in Hamilton, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Mahoning County Justice Center and the Northeast Ohio Correctional Facility in Youngstown.

In line with the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on immigration and increase ICE enforcement, five sheriff’s offices in Ohio have signed 287(g) contracts with ICE — agreements that allow local law enforcement to take on some federal immigration enforcement duties.

The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office entered 287(g) contracts in February. Sheriff’s offices in Butler, Fayette, Lake and Portage counties also have 287(g) contracts.

“The ACLU of Ohio is committed to protecting immigrants' rights,” Levenson said. “We also are committed to being a watchdog for government transparency and accountability.”

However, authorities may still refuse them entry at U.S. ports of entry or instruct airline officials to deny boarding, meaning they may be technically eligible for visas but still barred from entering the country, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan said.

Why It Matters

Trump's travel ban was issued several months into his second term, after attempts during his first were repeatedly challenged in court. His immigration policies have faced multiple legal challenges, with judges giving the White House mixed results on whether these policies can be implemented.

What To Know

The court emphasized that the law underpinning the travel ban does not authorize such visa refusals and declined to defer to the State Department's historical practice, citing Supreme Court precedent limiting agency discretion.

The ruling benefits 55 diversity visa applicants from nations such as Afghanistan, Burma, Togo, Somalia, and Iran, but does not help those whose applications were formally denied.

The Trump administration has argued, as it did between 2017 and 2021, that visa restrictions and travel bans are necessary for national security, and that the president has the power to make such decisions.

The plaintiffs in the case were able to show Sooknanan, a Biden appointee, that they would suffer injury if their visas were not issued, having been admitted to the visa program and moved through the various steps since early 2024.

What Sooknanan did not do was rule the travel ban unlawful overall, meaning the restrictions on visa issuances remain in effect, pending any other lawsuits the administration may face.

Also, while visas may now be issued for the plaintiffs, that would not prevent U.S. Customs and Border Protection from refusing entry at the border.

What People Are Saying

Curtis Morrison, an immigration attorney on the lawsuit based in California, told Newsweek: ""Now, let's hope when it's time for the Trump administration to review the ban at the 90-day mark they do that in good faith, and it leads to a less restrictive ban that will allow plaintiffs with issued immigrant visas to immigrate the US and start their lives here.""

Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, told Newsweek in a statement: ""Another example of wrongful judicial overreach aimed at curtailing this Administration's strong and unwavering efforts to keep Americans and our communities safe. We will continue to relentlessly work to ensure the President of the United States is able to use every tool he has available, including visas, to finally bring oversight to who we allow to visit our country.""

What Happens Next

The State Department must now, in good faith, seek to process applications before the end of the fiscal year, on September 30, 2025.

Advocates, elected officials and a number of community members stood behind the yellow police tape while the situation unfolded. ICE later left the scene.

“Evidently, ICE was not able to effectuate a warrant, and so they left the scene,” Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said. “It just showed from the beginning that they did not have a legitimate purpose for being there.”

ICE acknowledged receipt of a WHYY News request for comment, but did not immediately answer questions. Gusciora described the scene as a “standoff.”

“We’re claiming victory because we prevented a family and others from being detained,” said Ana Paola Pazmino, executive director of Resistencia En Accion NJ.

She said the organization responded to the Bayard Street home after receiving a call Thursday morning.

The caller informed Resistencia En Accion NJ that ICE agents attempted to arrest three men who were entering a vehicle to get to work. Pazmino said ICE managed to detain one individual, but the other two fled. At least one entered the home.

“ICE agents are outside,” Pazmino said while the standoff was still active. “They’re roaming the streets. They have about seven unmarked cars. They don’t have warrants.”

Pazmino said ICE agents berated and intimidated bystanders with “degrading” remarks. Law enforcement cordoned off the street. Advocates, upon their arrival, confronted ICE.

“There’s children inside. People are hiding in closets calling us to see what’s going on,” Pazmino said.

The Trenton Police Department did not immediately return calls for comment regarding ICE’s operation. Gusciora said the Trenton Police Department is not assisting ICE.

Pazmino said the organization has photos and videos of local police allowing ICE to cross the police tape.

“Even if we are trying to say that we’re not working with ICE agents federally, police and localities need to do a better job of not allowing them into these spaces, because children are terrified,” Pazmino said.

Each weekday immigrants make their way through the halls of 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, uneasy and confused, searching for the right courtroom for their asylum hearing. Most carry a handful of documents and dress in their sharpest outfits. They turn a corner and stop cold as they stumble into a team of black-masked agents huddled against the walls.

The agents stand, shoulders slumped, eyes cast at phones, hands tucked into plate carriers affixed with velcro patches advertising a constellation of three letter agencies—ICE, CBP, ATF, DSS, FBI, HSI—and the US Border Patrol. One is struck by their casual sloppiness and lack of proper uniforms. Take away the service weapons and body armor, and they could be delivering pizzas.

Into this dynamic stumble the photographers. It is a quirk of the ad-hoc nature of the immigration courts that they are shoehorned into hallways that double as public spaces—where the press, same as the agents, is authorized to operate.

The photographers bunch up alongside the bunched-up agents, bored and tired and shifting from one foot to the other, every so often raising a camera directly in a masked face. The agents strike up conversations, curious about the photographers’ work. Sometimes they confide that they hate what they are doing. Sometimes they quietly pass along tips.

The agents thumb through a stack of papers. Each page has a photograph in the top left corner and a name—the “target”—they are hunting. Sometimes they wait quietly in the back of the courtroom, texting colleagues: Be ready. Hearing concluded, the individual exits into the hallway. The agents circle, ask the person’s name, confirming the target, and then take them by the elbow as their expression collapses. The agents walk their captives into an elevator or a stairwell, barking at the photographers backpedaling and jostling for position. And then they are gone.

It is this breach of trust—this shattering of a person’s faith in the benevolence and intrinsic fairness of America, that is the hardest thing to watch. Here legally, engaged in a sanctioned process to determine their eligibility for asylum, they have committed no crime. They are arrested anyway, and the lives they’ve risked to come to the United States are thrown into chaos.

After the last detention on their lists, the agents depart en masse and the photographers head out to compare notes over a sandwich or coffee—or some days over a beer. They talk about what they’ve seen, parse what they have learned. On many days they wonder aloud: “What will we do if they kick us out?”—if the federal authorities cut off press access to the immigration courts.

""We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,"" the department later told Newsweek in a statement.

Why It Matters

The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly made clear that it is taking a tough stance on immigration and border security, with the State Department playing a key role in determining eligibility for visa applications from overseas. It also monitors ongoing temporary visas, such as student and cultural exchange programs.

What To Know

The State Department's assertion that all visa holders were subject to continual vetting is not necessarily new information, with various instances of visas being revoked in recent months, particularly those of foreign students.

The federal government as a whole is taking an increasingly tougher approach to legal immigration, with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) recently announcing its agents would be on the lookout for anti-Americanism from benefits applicants going forward.

Any such expressions could see visa extensions, green cards or naturalizations denied.

The State Department's message on Thursday appeared to reflect a similar sentiment, with officials confirming to Newsweek that the agency was looking for any indicators of ineligibility, such as visa overstays, threats to public safety and criminal activity.

With several million legal immigrants in the U.S. at any one time, it remained to be seen how such ongoing vetting could be achieved.

A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek that officials were reviewing all available information as part of vetting processes, including law enforcement and immigration records.

Since January, the spokesperson said, the department had revoked twice as many visas as during the same period last year.

What People Are Saying

USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser, in a news release earlier this week: ""America's benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.""

What's Next

The language from the State Department on Thursday indicated a renewed effort to check up on immigrants within the U.S., but it was not immediately clear how such check-ins would take place.

The ministry said in a statement that the agreement had been concluded but that terms were still being worked out. It added that Uganda prefers that the migrants sent there be of African nationalities, but did not elaborate on what Uganda might get in return for accepting deportees.

The U.S. embassy in Uganda declined to comment on what it called ""diplomatic negotiations,"" but said that diplomats were seeking to uphold U.S. President Donald Trump's ""policy of keeping Americans safe.""

The Trump administration has been seeking ways to deter migrants from entering the country illegally and to deport those who already have done so, especially those with criminal records and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home country.

Human rights activists criticized the deportee deal as possibly going against international law.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, on Wednesday had denied that any agreement on deportees had been reached, though he said his government was in discussions about ""visas, tariffs, sanctions, and related issues."" He also suggested that his country would draw the line at accepting people associated with criminal groups.

""We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?"" he said at the time.

Oryem and other Ugandan government officials declined to comment Thursday.

Opposition lawmaker Muwada Nkunyingi suggested that such a deal with the United States would give the Ugandan government legitimacy ahead of elections, and urged Washington not to turn a blind eye toward what he described as human rights and governance issues in Uganda.

Uganda's leaders will rush into a deal to ""clear their image now that we are heading into the 2026 elections,"" Nkunyingi said.

Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio likened a deportee deal to human trafficking, and said it would leave status of the deportees unclear. ""Are they refugees or prisoners?"" he said.

""The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,"" he said. ""That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me; how is that different from human trafficking?""

In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight more to South Sudan. The men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Vietnam sent to Eswatini are being held in solitary confinement until they can be deported to their home countries, which could take up to a year.

A legal challenge in the U.S had halted the deportation process of the eight men in South Sudan but a Supreme Court ruling eventually cleared the way for them to be sent to South Sudan.

Uganda has had challenges with the U.S. after lawmakers passed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2023 that punishes consensual same-sex conduct with penalties including life imprisonment. Washington threatened consequences and the World Bank withheld some funding.

But under President Trump, the White House has pursued a near-reversal of the federal government’s interpretation of Title VI.
But experts cautioned that without federal pressure, some districts would weaken their supports for students learning English.
“There is nothing holding the school districts accountable in any meaningful way,” she said.
“They are testing boundaries,” she said of the Trump administration.","The Trump administration has rescinded federal guidance requiring schools to provide a broad range of services to students who are not proficient in English.

Those services include language acquisition classes, supports for disabilities and access to grade-level curriculum materials.

The guidance was issued in 2015 under President Barack Obama. At that time, the Education and Justice Departments told school districts that failing to provide such services would violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which seeks to prevent discrimination based on race and national origin.

But under President Trump, the White House has pursued a near-reversal of the federal government’s interpretation of Title VI. Instead of using the law to seek support for racial and ethnic minorities, as it was established to do, the administration has often argued that efforts to help groups such as immigrant and Black children are discriminatory toward other students.

The rescission was first reported by The Washington Post.

In a statement, the Education Department said the rescinded guidance “was overly prescriptive and micro-managing of how states implement federal English language programs.”

The statement added: “States have vastly different needs for this important population of students and are best equipped to determine how best to educate these students while following all applicable federal laws.”

School districts might not immediately change their practices in response to the rescission. Many are committed to providing these services.

But experts cautioned that without federal pressure, some districts would weaken their supports for students learning English. Staff cuts at the Education Department have drastically reduced the number of employees who support local schools in the areas of language-acquisition and civil rights.

Jill Siegelbaum, a former lawyer at the agency whose position was eliminated earlier this month, said she was concerned that districts would respond to the rescission of the guidance by failing to integrate students learning English into the mainstream school population.

“There is nothing holding the school districts accountable in any meaningful way,” she said.

She also pointed out that the underlying laws and regulations regarding the rights of students learning English had not changed since the 1980s.

“They are testing boundaries,” she said of the Trump administration. “And they don’t seem to have any problem challenging laws that have been repeatedly tested, examined, re-examined and relied upon for significant periods of time. That is true across the board.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21trump-news-english-learners-gmth/21trump-news-english-learners-gmth-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 17:57:19.948250

""In the wake of the Biden administration’s open border policies, the dedicated men and women of ICE now face unprecedented challenges in removing millions of criminal illegal aliens from our country.""

""Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, we now have funding to recruit and hire Americans who want to patriotically serve their country and protect American communities,"" Lyons added.

In a written answer to a question posed by The Associated Press, the department said on Thursday that all US visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye towards any indication that they could be ineligible for the document.

While the government initially said it would focus only on dangerous criminals, thousands of people are being arrested daily, with the New York Times estimating this week that the government is on track to deport 400,000 people in 2025.

Authorities have gone after working immigrants through unprecedented raids of restaurants, construction sites, and farms – as well as in courthouses where immigration agents arrest those attending civil appointments needed to help legalise their status.

“Obviously Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuary.","The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has threatened to “flood” Boston with immigration agents following Mayor Michelle Wu’s refusal to drop the city’s sanctuary policies.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said during a Wednesday interview on ""The Howie Carr Show,"" a conservative radio program, that the agency would expand its presence in the area. His comments followed a news conference on Tuesday at which Wu said that Boston would “not back down” from its policy of limiting police from cooperating with ICE on civil immigration enforcement efforts.

Lyons said that sanctuary policies like Boston's are detrimental to safety.

“We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said on the radio show. “Obviously Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuary. … So 100%, you’re going to see more ICE presence.”

When asked about Lyons’ interview, Wu’s office directed NBC News to the mayor’s comments to reporters on the topic at an unrelated Thursday event.

“This is a beautiful, diverse, incredible city, and I have said it now very directly: This administration needs to stop attacking cities to hide their own failures,” Wu said.

Boston has a robust immigrant population, with more than 28% of its residents being foreign-born as of 2021. China, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Vietnam make up the top countries of origin. In recent years, crime has continued to drop steadily, with homicides reaching a historic low by the end of 2024. Robberies, aggravated assaults and motor vehicle thefts and fraud related offenses have also dropped across Massachusetts, according to data released by the state.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head last week, when the Justice Department sent letters to 35 sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. The DOJ ordered the jurisdictions to submit plans by early this week to show that they are taking steps to ditch the policies, threatening to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.

“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,” the letter, signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, said. “This ends now.”

Wu hit back in a heated letter to Bondi on Tuesday, calling the attorney general’s demands an “attack” on U.S. cities and a tactic to “make Americans fearful of one another.”

“On behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and for our democracy,” Wu wrote. “Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone.”

The Boston mayor further slammed the DOJ’s demands during a news conference outside City Hall that same day.

“You are wrong on the law and you are wrong on safety,” Wu said. “Most of all, you are wrong on cities.”

Boston’s immigration protections stretch back to 2014, when the city enacted the Boston Trust Act aimed at promoting trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. The legislation, which was amended in 2019, allows the Boston Police Department to collaborate with ICE on issues of “significant public safety” — including human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking and cybercrimes — but keeps the department out of civil immigration enforcement. Most recently, at the end of 2024, the City Council adopted a resolution that reaffirmed the act.

“The Trust Act’s provisions have been instrumental in fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all residents, ensuring that immigrants can engage with local law enforcement without fear of deportation,” the resolution said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250821-michelle-wu-ew-1155a-f833bf.jpg",N,,2025-08-21 17:57:34.656882

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to leaders of these jurisdictions, including to Wu, demanding that they abandon their sanctuary policies.
We are going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary policies,” Lyons said of Wu.
Under a 2017 Supreme Judicial Court decision, local authorities cannot detain someone just because federal immigration authorities believe they are subject to civil removal.
“You can see all the success we’re having nationwide, and people are now understanding exactly the law enforcement mission of ICE,” Lyons said.","Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, said more federal agents are needed in Boston to counteract Mayor Michelle Wu's policies.

The head of ICE said Wednesday that the agency was preparing to increase its presence in and around Boston, potentially ratcheting up tensions between local leaders and federal law enforcement officials.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, made the comments during an interview on “The Howie Carr Show” when he was asked to respond to Mayor Michelle Wu’s defiance of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda.

“100% you will see a larger ICE presence,” Lyons told Carr.

As Lyons oversees ICE’s efforts to enact President Donald Trump’s mass deportation goals, federal officials are targeting “sanctuary” jurisdictions where policies limit the ways in which local police can cooperate with federal immigration agents. Boston is one of these places, and Wu has engaged in a monthslong feud with the Trump administration on the topic.

There is no one set legal definition of what makes a place a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The Department of Justice recently published a broad list of sanctuary jurisdiction criteria and named a number of cities, states, and counties that the federal government says have “policies that materially impede enforcement of federal immigration statutes and regulations.” Massachusetts as a whole is not on that list, but Boston is.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to leaders of these jurisdictions, including to Wu, demanding that they abandon their sanctuary policies. Wu issued her response during a large press conference she convened outside City Hall on Tuesday.

“Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law,” the mayor said.

Carr played clips of Wu’s speech for Lyons and asked him if he would direct ICE to “surge” into Boston and Massachusetts in a similar manner to some of the enforcement activity taking place in Washington, D.C.

“We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, ‘flood the zone,’ especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said.

He referenced a monthlong operation ICE conducted in Massachusetts in May, where almost 1,500 people were detained. Earlier in the year, ICE arrested some 370 people through an “enhanced operation” that federal officials directly blamed Wu and local sanctuary policies for.

Wu says that the city regularly works with federal law enforcement to find and detain people with criminal warrants. Lyons maintains that Wu and leaders like her are willingly releasing violent “criminal aliens” back onto city streets.

“We are going to continue to do our mission. We are going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary policies,” Lyons said of Wu.

An ordinance known as the Boston Trust Act, which the City Council unanimously reaffirmed in anticipation of Trump’s return to the White House, is Boston’s sanctuary policy. It dictates that Boston police officers cannot ask individuals about their immigration status, make arrests based solely on ICE administrative warrants, or share certain information with ICE. It does allow the BPD to work with ICE on matters of “significant public safety importance,” like human trafficking, child exploitation, and cybercrimes.

Wu and many of her allies in the city say that the Trust Act improves public safety by allowing people to report crimes to the BPD without fearing that doing so could impact their immigration status.

Even if Wu or another Boston mayor were to abandon the Trust Act, state law would still limit how the BPD could interact with ICE. Under a 2017 Supreme Judicial Court decision, local authorities cannot detain someone just because federal immigration authorities believe they are subject to civil removal.

“In Boston we comply with and follow all of the laws: city, state, and federal. We will not back down from the communities who have made us the safest major city in the country,” Wu told reporters at an unrelated event Thursday when asked about Lyons’s comments.

Lyons, who previously served as the head of ICE’s Boston Field Office, told Carr that he still has many friends within the BPD that want to enthusiastically work with ICE but are worried about the repercussions if they do so.

“We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us, and that are actually helping us behind the scenes,” he said.

Spokespeople for the BPD did not return requests for comment about Lyons’s remarks Thursday.

In June, the Wu administration began to formally request details on people being arrested by immigration agents in the city. ICE said publicly that it would comply.

However, Wu said this week that the agency is not responding to the city’s Freedom of Information Act requests. Boston is now filing an administrative appeal insisting that ICE produce the documents, and Wu said that her administration is prepared to use “every legal tool available” to get the public information.

“It’s been two months without a response and without the real facts,” she said Thursday.

The exact contours of what an increased ICE presence in Boston could entail are unclear. With the passage of Trump’s signature domestic policy legislation earlier this summer, ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency. The agency’s annual budget is set to increase from about $8 billion to about $28 billion. Those dollars will help it massively increase detention space, deportation flights, and staffing.

A hiring spree is underway, with ICE offering perks like hefty signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness. The agency’s official recruitment webpage claims that “America has been invaded by criminals and predators,” in its attempts to draw in new recruits.

The number of people detained by ICE nationally has steadily increased since Trump began his second term. About 70% of the current detainees do not have a criminal conviction, according to data compiled by analysts at Syracuse University through the use of public records requests.

Lyons, who previously led ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations for the Boston Field Office, made that promise on the same day that Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city ""will not back down"" in response to the Trump administration's ultimatum demanding that communities identify existing ""practices that impede federal immigration enforcement.""

The ministry said in a statement that the agreement had been concluded but that terms were still being worked out. It added that Uganda prefers that the migrants sent there be of African nationalities, but did not elaborate on what Uganda might get in return for accepting deportees.

The U.S. Embassy in Uganda declined to comment on what it called “diplomatic negotiations,” but said that diplomats were seeking to uphold President Trump’s “policy of keeping Americans safe.”

The Trump administration has been seeking ways to deter migrants from entering the country illegally and to deport those who already have done so, especially those with criminal records and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home country.

Human rights activists criticized the deportee deal as possibly going against international law.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda’s state minister for foreign affairs, on Wednesday had denied that any agreement on deportees had been reached, though he said his government was in discussions about “visas, tariffs, sanctions, and related issues.” He also suggested that his country would draw the line at accepting people associated with criminal groups.

“We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?” he said at the time.

Oryem and other Ugandan government officials declined to comment Thursday.

Opposition lawmaker Muwada Nkunyingi suggested that such a deal with the United States would give the Ugandan government legitimacy ahead of elections, and urged Washington not to turn a blind eye toward what he described as human rights and governance issues in Uganda.

Uganda’s leaders will rush into a deal to “clear their image now that we are heading into the 2026 elections,” Nkunyingi said.

Human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio likened a deportee deal to human trafficking, and said it would leave the status of the deportees unclear. “Are they refugees or prisoners?” he said.

“The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” he said. “That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me; how is that different from human trafficking?”

In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight more to South Sudan. The men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Vietnam sent to Eswatini are being held in solitary confinement until they can be deported to their home countries, which could take up to a year.

A legal challenge in the U.S had halted the deportation process of the eight men in South Sudan but a Supreme Court ruling eventually cleared the way for them to be sent to South Sudan.

Uganda has had challenges with the U.S. after lawmakers passed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2023 that punishes consensual same-sex conduct with penalties including life imprisonment. Washington threatened consequences and the World Bank withheld some funding.

“These folks who are working at these private prison companies, who are on Kristi Noem’s staff right now, they are at some point going to have to testify under oath about what is happening in the facilities that they’re currently running,” he added.

Democrats have slammed Republicans for rejecting their attempts to conduct oversight at facilities where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold detained migrants awaiting deportation. Some state lawmakers were also denied entry to Alligator Alcatraz last month, the detention center in the Florida Everglades.

They have also been critical of President Trump’s robust immigration agenda, with turmoil rising after lawmakers joined with protestors outside an ICE center in New York earlier this year and anti-ICE protests sprung up in Southern California and beyond in opposition to an uptick in deportation raids after the administration sent National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles to quell demonstrations.

Families of those detained and human rights groups have said their loved ones are suffering from abuse while in ICE custody, such as a lack of clean water and electricity.

Amid a federal takeover late last week, the Trump administration reversed course and agreed to leave the police chief in control of the Metropolitan Police Department after city government officials filed a lawsuit. Still, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the district’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law, and the following day included immigration enforcement to their tasks. Six Republican-led states agreed to deploy their crop of federal troops to assist in Washington.

“I don’t think it’s even about crime. It’s about control and sliding towards authoritarianism,” Ronald Claude, director of policy and advocacy with the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, told Capital B. “It’s the same approach they did since 2016 when it comes to the border, saying there’s chaos at the border, the border is running amok. … Instead of actually looking at the data” to “further their own political objectives.”

The only increase in numbers is the amount of individuals ICE has detained, according to Claude and a July report published by the Prison Policy Initiative.

Last week’s orders from Bondi marked a shift from the police department’s previous stance as a sanctuary jurisdiction, in which law enforcement officers did not notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an undocumented person was charged with a crime or released from custody — actions that could have led to potential deportation.

“It’s all about deportation,” Claude said. “Instead of who feels unsafe walking outside their house. Instead of how much funding has gone into activities for teens after 5. Instead of how much has gone into homelessness, rent is going up every single year — we missed those issues.”

Trump’s federal takeover announcement also came within the same week that Bondi released a list of 35 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” which are cities, counties, and states accused of enacting policies that hinder federal immigration efforts. Bondi threatened legal action and to withhold victim compensation funds against these areas, signaling a replicated push that primarily targets Black and brown immigrant communities, many of whom are undocumented or presumed to be.

Those threats “clearly violate the 10th Amendment,” according to an analysis written by Spencer Reynolds, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. The amendment, he said, “provides that powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states as independent sovereigns in our system of federalism.”

If this administration’s efforts in Washington are about “who provides safety and what is safety — and if you ask our communities like Black immigrants and Black folks — I guarantee you it is not seeing tanks coming through your streets or police that makes us feel safe,” Claude said.

So what does Bondi’s threat mean now for other mayors and Black families living in the district and beyond? Read on to find out.

What is a sanctuary jurisdiction, and has this kind of crackdown happened before?

This wasn’t the first time Trump and his attorney general have escalated its crackdown on what they deemed then as “sanctuary cities” or jurisdictions. A sanctuary jurisdiction is a city, county, or state that has implemented policies that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement, particularly ICE.

In 2020, following nationwide protests over George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, officials used a legal loophole to deploy the National Guard to the district and sent unidentified federal agents to Portland, Oregon, leading to thousands of arrests, most of which were later dismissed.

Officials in places like New Jersey and Oregon labeled the Trump administration’s threats at the time as political theater — “bullying” and “election-year stunts.” In March 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Trump-era cases against sanctuary cities after former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Merrick Garland, withdrew the government’s support.

This time around, it took less than a week in August for Washington and other sanctuary locations to become direct targets for Trump. Two days after the Aug. 3 carjacking of a former Department of Government Ethics official, Bondi revealed the list, and by Aug. 8 Trump signed an executive order that temporarily deployed federal troops into the district.

“We have seen time and again that when law enforcement is militarized, it is our Black, Brown, and immigrant neighbors who suffer the most,” Guerline M. Jozef, founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said in an Aug. 13 press release in response to Trump deploying the National Guard into Washington.

On Aug. 5, Bondi named 12 states and Washington, D.C., four counties — Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, and San Diego and San Francisco counties in California — and 18 cities in 10 states within communities that have a large population of documented and undocumented Black residents.

Additionally, Washington, D.C., was listed as a “state.” And the five boroughs — each a separate county — that make up New York City were not individually listed in the Justice Department’s county-level breakdown of sanctuary jurisdictions.

Claude said that other locations on the list must “keep fighting” as Boston Mayor Michelle Wu did, rejecting Bondi’s one-week deadline to respond to her letter of intent.

“This is not an option,” Claude said. “We’re imploring folks to go to your city council meetings, push your city council, push your town commissioner, if that’s what you have, your governor, your mayor, because they have a voice. They can do something. They can stand up.”

What is a 48-hour immigration hold?

A 48-hour immigration hold, also known as an ICE detainer, is a request from ICE to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold someone for up to 48 hours after they would otherwise be released from jail, so ICE can take custody for possible immigration enforcement.

This typically happens when a person under arrest, regardless of their socioeconomic status, is flagged as potentially removable due to their immigration status. The hold gives ICE time to arrive and make a federal immigration arrest after local criminal proceedings are finished.

Arrests now increasingly occur in jails and near courthouses. Two recent examples: Rony Dieujuste in Palm Beach, Florida, and Marlon Parris in Phoenix. Neither of those locations appears on the DOJ’s sanctuary jurisdiction list.

With three years remaining in the Trump administration, recent executive orders appear to disproportionately impact undocumented individuals, unhoused people, and residents of low-income communities — particularly those who are Black or Latino — compared with their white counterparts in similar circumstances, according to advocates and civil rights groups.

“President Trump speaks of poor and homeless people as if they are debris to be swept away, not human beings with dignity and dreams,” Jozef wrote in the Aug.13 press release. “Moving people without a real plan is not leadership — it’s cruelty dressed up as policy. This is the kind of dehumanization that turns poverty into a crime and erases the humanity of our most vulnerable neighbors.”

Are all immigration arrests happening in designated sanctuary jurisdictions?

While sanctuary jurisdictions have historically attempted to shield undocumented residents from deportation — often by refusing to detain people for ICE — federal and state law enforcement agencies are adapting.

“Many cities and states have tried to offer sanctuary for immigrants by refusing to rent jail space to ICE … but it is not enough,” Jacob Kang-Brown, author of Hiding in Plain Sight, a report published by the Prison Policy Initiative, said in a press release. The report reveals the role of locally run jails in Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

Bondi said in the Aug. 5 press release that several lawsuits had already been filed against local governments. These lawsuits demand that judges order jurisdictions to abandon their sanctuary policies and comply with Trump’s April executive order, which, in part, seeks to block undocumented people from receiving federal benefits.

In Louisville, Kentucky, under Democratic leadership, Mayor Craig Greenberg recently announced compliance with the DOJ’s demands, citing fear of losing millions in federal funds if kept on the list. In an interview with Spectrum News, Greenberg said the city would reinstate 48-hour courthouse holds.

Black people in the U.S. are arrested at 2.5 times the rate of their white counterparts, despite similar criminal activity rates, according to a report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Once entangled in the criminal legal system, Black migrants are often flagged by ICE, creating a pathway from routine traffic stops to deportation proceedings. Among the most frequent forms of police contact leading to deportation are simple traffic violations.

Do sanctuary cities affect crime rates?

The simple answer is no.

Research released by the University of New Mexico this February shows that sanctuary cities do not have higher crime rates than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. But even in sanctuary cities, immigration enforcement remains a serious concern. Bondi said she sent letters of intent to the mayors of 35 such jurisdictions, giving them one week to respond and affirm that they will not obstruct federal deportation efforts.

As deportation efforts increase, those accused of overstaying their green cards, visas, or other forms of entry — regardless of their immigration status — must remain vigilant, advocates have said.

“It doesn’t make me feel safe when I look across the street at my neighbor, and you’re knocking on their door randomly to see their papers and to deport them or separate families,” Claude said. “That doesn’t keep anyone safe, and it causes more harm.”

“We reject it,” Jozef said in the Aug. 13 press release. “Our neighborhoods need increase[d] congressional funding, housing, healthcare, and humane immigration policies — not troops in the streets.”

These warnings are imperative, especially since simple traffic violations are among the most common reasons police come into contact with immigrants who later face deportation, according to a report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.

Dieujuste, the Haitian immigrant who was living in Florida, was arrested following a traffic stop for allegedly driving under the influence.

“The Trump administration is leveraging jails at a new scale, using local contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service and existing policing practices in order to expand detention,” Kang-Brown said in the report’s press release.

The Prison Policy Initiative’s report revealed that ICE’s reported headcount of 57,200 detainees as of June is incomplete. The report found an additional 26,200 people held in jails and prisons for immigration-related reasons who were not included in ICE’s public records.",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2226825501-1-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-21 15:56:52.018651

The clarification follows a Washington Post article that listed the Tribe’s land as one of three potential sites in Colorado for a facility to detain undocumented immigrants.

Here is the Southern Ute Indian Tribe’s statement:

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe (Tribe) is aware of recent media coverage regarding the expansion of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities across the country, including in the State of Colorado. We recognize that these reports have placed the Tribe at the center of a highly polarizing national issue, and we want to be clear: the Tribe has not entered into any agreement with ICE regarding detention operations.

The Tribe was surprised to learn of its inclusion in a planning document referenced by the Washington Post, which listed potential ICE facility sites. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), confirmed to the Washington Post that the document was created by ICE but is outdated and unapproved. The relationship between the Tribe and ICE has been mischaracterized. The Tribe was not notified nor consulted prior to the release of this information. It is important to note, there have been no discussions between Tribal Council and federal authorities on this matter.

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe remains committed to protecting the Tribal Membership and upholding its sovereignty. Any future consideration of detention-related arrangements would require Tribal Council approval and be guided by the Tribe’s core principles and values. The Tribe appreciates the opportunity to clarify its position and urges the public and media to respect the sovereignty and integrity of Tribal governance.

The court, which split on the merits of the lawsuit and Engoron’s fraud finding, dismissed the penalty in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for an appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals.
The appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump’s appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall.
Legal obstacles The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.
The appeals court declined in June to reconsider.","Trump, in a social media post, claimed “total victory.”

“I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,” he wrote.

The decision came seven months after the Republican returned to the White House. A sharply divided panel of five judges in New York’s mid-level Appellate Division couldn’t agree on many issues raised in Trump’s appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive.”

After finding Trump flagrantly padded financial statements that went to lenders and insurers, Judge Arthur Engoron ordered him last year to pay $355 million in penalties. With interest, the sum has topped $515 million. Additional penalties levied on some other Trump Organization executives, including Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr. — bring the total to $527 million, with interest.

An ‘excessive’ fine

“While the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants’ business culture, the court’s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton wrote in one of three opinions shaping the appeals court’s ruling.

Engoron’s other punishments, upheld by the appeals court, have been on pause during Trump’s appeal, and the president was able to hold off collection of the money by posting a $175 million bond.

The court, which split on the merits of the lawsuit and Engoron’s fraud finding, dismissed the penalty in its entirety while also leaving a pathway for an appeal to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. Trump and his co-defendants, the judges wrote, can seek to extend the pause on any punishments taking effect.

The panel was sharply divided, issuing 323 pages of concurring and dissenting opinions with no majority. Rather, some judges endorsed parts of their colleagues’ findings while denouncing others, enabling the court to rule.

Two judges wrote that they felt New York Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit against Trump and his companies was justifiable and that she had proven her case but the penalty was too severe. One wrote that James exceeded her legal authority in bringing the suit, saying that if any of Trump’s lenders felt cheated, they could have sued him themselves, and none did. One judge wrote that Engoron erred by ruling before the trial began that the attorney general had proved Trump engaged in fraud.

In his portion of the ruling, Judge David Friedman, who was appointed to the court by Republican Gov. George Pataki, was scathing in his criticism of James for bringing the lawsuit.

“Plainly, her ultimate goal was not ‘market hygiene’ … but political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump’s political career and the destruction of his real estate business,” Friedman wrote. “The voters have obviously rendered a verdict on his political career. This bench today unanimously derails the effort to destroy his business.”

In a statement, James focused on the part of the case that went her way, saying the court had “affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud.”

“It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,” James said.

The appeals court, the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court, took an unusually long time to rule, weighing Trump’s appeal for nearly 11 months after oral arguments last fall. Normally, appeals are decided in a matter of weeks or a few months.

Claims of politics at play

Trump and his co-defendants denied wrongdoing. At the conclusion of the civil trial in January 2024, Trump said he was “an innocent man” and the case was a “fraud on me.” The Republican has repeatedly maintained the case and the verdict were political moves by James and Engoron, both Democrats.

Trump’s Justice Department has subpoenaed James for records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an investigation into whether she violated the president’s civil rights. James’ personal attorney Abbe D. Lowell has said investigating the fraud case is “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president’s political retribution campaign.”

Trump and his lawyers said his financial statements weren’t deceptive, since they came with disclaimers noting they weren’t audited. The defense also noted bankers and insurers independently evaluated the numbers, and the loans were repaid.

Despite such discrepancies as tripling the size of his Trump Tower penthouse, he said the financial statements were, if anything, lowball estimates of his fortune.

During an appellate court hearing last September, Trump’s lawyers argued that many of the case’s allegations were too old and that James had misused a consumer protection law to sue Trump over private business transactions that were satisfactory to those involved.

State attorneys said that while Trump insists no one was harmed by the financial statements, his exaggerations led lenders to make riskier loans and that honest borrowers lose out when others game their net worth numbers.

Legal obstacles

The civil fraud case was just one of several legal obstacles for Trump as he campaigned, won and segued to a second term as president.

On Jan. 10, he was sentenced in his criminal hush money case to what’s known as an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction on the books but sparing him jail, probation, a fine or other punishment. He is appealing the conviction.

And in December, a federal appeals court upheld a jury’s finding that Trump sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, affirming a $5 million judgment against him. The appeals court declined in June to reconsider. Trump still can try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.

Trump also is appealing a subsequent verdict that requires him to pay Carroll $83.3 million for additional defamation claims.

Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.

The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.

As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.

But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.

The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

The letter said the changes would slow decisions on detained and juvenile dockets, as well as cases tied to the Trump administration’s revived “Remain in Mexico” program.

Democrats also flagged the absence of any administration plan to replace the ousted judges — a process that can take up to a year of training — and warned that reducing the Board of Immigration Appeals from 28 to 15 members would have “practical repercussions on the Board’s caseload and quality of decisions.”

Some judges learned of their dismissals in the middle of active hearings, the lawmakers said, describing the sudden firings as “alarming” and “unjustified.” The union representing immigration judges has also reported that nearly 100 court staff, including 18 judges, have accepted early retirement or resignation offers under the Trump administration.

The letter, signed by more than 60 senators and representatives including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Cory Booker of New Jersey, demands that Bondi explain the firings, detail plans for replacing the judges, and outline how the Justice Department will address the ballooning backlog.

But what Trump is doing to DC in 2025 is not quite unprecedented – not for him, and not for the federal government.","Washington, DC, youth activist Afeni Evans has become the most recent symbol of US President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s police.

On August 15, Metro Transit Police officers pepper-sprayed and forced the 28-year-old Evans to the ground at the Navy Yard subway stop for allegedly committing fare evasion. Evans and other Harriet’s Wildest Dreams volunteers were at the station on “cop watch” to ensure the federal takeover would not lead to harassment of Black youth. Yet, it happened to three Black youths anyway, prompting Evans to intervene, which led to her arrest.

After public protests in DC and on social media, she was released to cheering crowds outside the court, and the charges against her were dropped the next day.

Like with so many other issues related to Trump and his attempts at autocracy, his use of the National Guard and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stifle community ecosystems especially impacts Washington’s Black, Brown and Queer residents. This effort to squash potential dissent is more than a distraction from the Epstein files controversy or America’s economic troubles.

Locally, it is a partial end to the District of Columbia’s half-century of home rule, which otherwise makes the city independent of direct federal oversight. Nationally, it is an open question about whether DC can remain a site of protest, a place where marches and other gatherings can effect change or even occur at all in the current autocratic climate.

Trump’s executive order announcing his takeover of DC’s police force on August 11 should not have come as a surprise, especially given his attempts to bring the federal government’s power to bear in California back in June. “Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia”, the order reads, stating that the “increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic… poses intolerable risks to the vital federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.

But the truth is, Trump’s executive order manufactured a crisis out of far-right fantasies. Six days before Trump’s announcement, two teenagers carjacked Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old former staffer at the Department of Government Efficiency, in DC’s Logan Circle. “We’re going to do something about it. That includes bringing in the National Guard,” Trump said in the aftermath of the incident.

However, the two alleged carjackers in police custody were from Hyattsville, Maryland, in Prince George’s County, and not DC.

Trump’s moves also fly in the face of another truth: Crime is no bigger an issue in DC than it is anywhere else in the United States. At the beginning of the year, a joint report from the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) showed that the city’s violent crime rate had dropped by 35 percent in 2024, reaching its lowest rate since the mid-1990s. “Armed carjackings are down 53%,” according to the report.

Washington, DC, is a great stage for beta-testing how willing the rest of the US is to go to achieve Trump’s dream of autocratic rule. DC remains a majority-minority city, with Black Washingtonians making up a plurality (43 percent) of the population, despite 30 years of middle-class (mostly white) gentrification – white Washingtonians make up 39 percent of DC’s population.

So, it is not that surprising Trump would attempt such heavy-handed tactics in a soft occupation of DC, particularly in a city that was once famously nicknamed “Chocolate City”. In a capital where more than 90 percent of voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, Trump is also sending the unvarnished and racist message that Black folk, and especially Black youth, are criminals.

Imposing a heightened police presence and hundreds of National Guard soldiers on a multiracial city is nothing but a wannabe strongman’s attempt to appear strong to his anti-Black supporters.

DC is also known as a place that holds significance for Queer Americans. One out of every seven adults in the nation’s capital identifies as LGBTQIA+, roughly 80,000 Washingtonians in all. Northwest DC, particularly communities like Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Adams Morgan, and parts of Shaw and Columbia Heights, became a relatively safe space in the 1960s and 1970s for Queer culture and businesses to thrive. The inaugural National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights began in DC in 1979.

It should not shock anyone that an anti-Queer Trump administration would also target DC’s Queer and migrant spaces. The federalised police presence in DC has been especially noticeable along the 14th Street and U Street corridors, including the installation of not-so-random checkpoints over the past couple of weeks. Inevitably – between the National Guard, federal law enforcement and anti-immigrant agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in conjunction with the MPD – they have made dozens of arrests, and smothered nightlife and business traffic in these communities.

Trump, in his own ham-fisted way, is also attempting to erase DC’s history as one of protest and resistance. As the US evolved into a superpower, and DC transformed into the international community’s superpower city during and after World War II, the city also became a place for protest, particularly for racial justice and civil rights. Examples include the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, as well as a series of antiwar protests against Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. Marches and protests for the Equal Rights Amendment, for a Gay Rights Bill, for Chicano rights, Indigenous rights, and migrant and refugee rights came alongside civil rights marches and protests throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Massive protests like the 2017 Women’s March, the George Floyd protests in 2020 and the Free Palestine protests last year have made DC a target ripe for government overreach.

But what Trump is doing to DC in 2025 is not quite unprecedented – not for him, and not for the federal government. In 2018, during Trump’s first term as president, the US National Park Service (NPS) sought to shrink the available sidewalk space around the White House for protests “by 80 percent”, and to charge demonstrators permit fees “to allow the NPS to recover some of the costs” of public safety provisions. On June 1, 2020, the National Guard and the US Park Police tear-gassed, lobbed concussion grenades and violently arrested George Floyd protesters at Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House – all so that Trump could do a photo-op nearby on the steps of St John’s Church, calling himself “your president of law and order” along the way.

Trump has followed in the footsteps of another “law and order” president, Richard Nixon. In May 1971, Nixon unleashed the National Guard and local police against thousands of antiwar demonstrators in DC, in what became known as the Mayday protests, leading to more than 12,000 arrests over a three-day period.

In 1932, President Herbert Hoover authorised the use of military force against a ragtag group of 20,000 unemployed and unhoused World War I veterans known as the Bonus Army. At the height of the Great Depression and looking for the bonus money Congress owed them, the military responded with gas grenades, bayonets, flamethrowers and tanks, destroying their shantytowns along the National Mall and Anacostia River. Two veterans died, while the Army injured thousands of others. The resulting tear gas cloud over the city also led to the death of an infant.

Trump and his small army of occupiers are trying to make an example out of the nation’s capital, to destroy the DC of the past century, its vibrancy and resistance. The irony, of course, is that one of Trump’s first acts in his second term was to pardon more than 1,500 insurrectionists who had been part of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a deadly and treasonous event.

Now, Trump wants to cower Washingtonians into accepting autocracy.

According to city officials and eyewitnesses, at least three Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests occurred this week, with no advance warning and little public explanation from federal authorities. The arrests — two on Tuesday morning and one on Monday — took place in public spaces, including a construction site and a bus stop, in an area known for its high immigrant population.

""This has long been a heavily immigrant community,” said Alexandria City Councilman Canek Aguirre, who visited the sites where the arrests happened. “But ICE doesn't exactly tell us what they're doing, and we’ve definitely seen an uptick in cases the past week or two.”

One of the arrests occurred at the Eaton Square apartment complex on Monday around lunchtime. Aguirre says several construction workers were taken while working on a roof.

“Their food was still there, the equipment, the vehicle was left wide open,” he said. “We don't even know who these folks were, where they were taken, or where they went.”

Video footage shared with WUSA9 shows two more arrests Tuesday morning — one at a bus stop on Glebe Road around 9:30 a.m. and another shortly after back at Eaton Square.

Evelin Urrutia, executive director of Tenants and Workers United, confirmed her organization is tracking at least three cases.

“These arrests are not targeting criminals, they're targeting workers,” she said. “There’s a lot of panic, but our community is strong. Still, this is affecting everyone — schools, families, the whole city.”

Councilman Aguirre criticized what he called “unconstitutional tactics,” particularly as arrests could happen during school dismissal.

“Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary.

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons told “The Howie Carr Show” on Wednesday.

“Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

It comes after the city’s mayor on Tuesday publicly rejected Attorney General Pam Bondi’s ultimatum to ax its sanctuary city law — or risk cuts to federal funding.

“Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law, and Boston will not back down from who we are or what we stand for. We will not back away from our community that has made us the safest city in the country,” Wu bellowed at a raucous press conference.

Lyons slammed the mayor’s resistance, insisting Boston’s sanctuary status was only making the streets more dangerous given that local cops can ignore ICE detainers — illegal migrants convicted of crimes can essentially be cut loose back into the community.

“That’s the issue we’re seeing in so many jurisdictions,” Lyons said.

“We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us and that are actually helping us behind the scenes.”

“That’s what I think local leaders don’t understand, is they need to talk to the men and women on the ground, because … there are so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that the local law enforcement have to deal with.

The Pentagon declined to specify how many civilian employees are expected to participate in the program.","The Pentagon is recruiting civilian employees to join Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign and asking staff to sign up for deployments to immigration enforcement facilities across the United States.

The defense department has posted a job listing requesting volunteers for civilian federal employees apply to join a “volunteer force” supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations. On Wednesday, the department reportedly emailed civilian employees asking them to take up this opportunity.

“The Secretary of Defense has authorized DoD civilian employees to participate in details to the Department of Homeland Security to contribute to its operations along the Southern Border and its internal immigration enforcement activities,” reads the email, obtained by 404Media. Roughly 950,000 civilian employees work for the Pentagon.

Selected employees will reportedly “offer critical support” to Ice and the border patrol “as they fulfill the President’s intent to ensure a safe and orderly immigration system”.

A US defense official confirmed the initiative, telling the Guardian: “The Secretary of Defense memorandum signed on Jun 1, 2025, ‘Detailing of Department of Defense Civilians Employees to Support the Department of Homeland Security’ allows DoD civilians employees to participate in a detail for up to 180-days, supporting the Department of Homeland Security’s operations on the southern border.”

The official said volunteer duties may include “data entry, operational planning support, processing and throughput logistics, and logistical support”.

The job posting warns deployment locations “are not negotiable” and conditions “could be austere”. Assignments last up to 180 days at facilities along the border and throughout the US interior, and detailing means the staff keeps their salary and benefits.

The recruitment effort stems from a June memorandum issued by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, that authorizes the civilian employee deployments “in support of the President’s priority of securing our borders”. The memo specifically enables both reimbursable and non-reimbursable details to DHS for southern border operations and “internal immigration enforcement”.

The Pentagon initiative comes as the Trump administration works to expand immigration enforcement personnel, infrastructure and operations across the country. The Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by Trump last month, includes budget for an additional 10,000 Ice agents, and Ice is reportedly offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 and has reduced its age requirements in an effort to expand its forces.

Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that DHS had reassigned dozens of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) employees to Ice.

Meanwhile, new detention facilities are being established in Nebraska, Florida and at military installations including Fort Bliss in Texas, which now houses migrants in tent structures with capacity for 5,000 people.

Ice arrests have surged nationwide, with northern California seeing a 123% increase in detentions between January and July compared to late 2024.

The administration has also begun deploying Ice agents alongside local police for routine traffic enforcement. In Washington DC, federal immigration agents now accompany police officers during moped traffic stops targeting food delivery drivers, most of whom are from Central or South America, according to reporting from the Washington Post.

The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced last week that approximately 1.6 million undocumented immigrants had left the US during her first 200 days in office, citing agency data. There is also a planned $20-50m ad buy dubbed “Stronger Border, Stronger America” to promote the work of the DHS set to launch in September.

The salary range for the volunteer positions spans from approximately $25,684 to $191,900 annually, with assignments requiring 76% or greater travel and no remote work options available, according to the job listing. Relocation expenses will not be reimbursed.

Agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) descended on the warehouse, in Edison, New Jersey, at 9am on Wednesday, the New York Times reported. Officers led some workers away in zip ties, employees told the Times, while people they deemed to have legal status in the US were given yellow wristbands.

Univision reported that the agents spent hours at the facility, during what CBP said was a “surprise inspection”. CBP told Univision the operation had begun as part of “routine efforts” to verify customs, employment and safety regulations.

CBP did not immediately respond to questions from the Guardian.

Videos taken by New Labor, a New Jersey-based labor and immigration reform organization, showed CBP vehicles at the site, along with unmarked SUVs. New Labor said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents were also at the raid.

“We have customs and border patrol [sic] holding the door open for their Ice counterparts to say they’re allowed in with us, and then they start doing immigration-related actions,” Amanda Dominguez, an organizer at New Labor, told News 12 New York.

“That is illegal. Ice still needs their own judicial warrant signed by a judge.”

Relatives of the workers gathered at the facility throughout the day, the Times reported, waiting for news about people inside.

“People were very upset and crying and angry, completely understandably,” said Ellen Whit, who works at Deportation & Immigrant Response Equipo (Dire), a New Jersey hotline that responds to calls about raids and from relatives of immigrants who have been detained, told the Times. “One girl’s father was taken. She was very, very upset.”

Workers described a chaotic scene as federal agents arrived. About 20 agents entered through the front door of the warehouse, witnesses told the Times, while other agents blocked alternative exits. Some people were injured amid the chaos, while others hid in the rafters of the warehouse for hours in an attempt to avoid the officers.

The raid comes weeks after 20 people were taken into custody by Ice at the Alba Wine and Spirits warehouse in Edison.

""We have followed every law, we have jumped through every hoop and our lives are being derailed because we took one wrong turn,"" Kristina Ramirez said.

On May 28, Sergio Serna Ramirez and his wife Kristina were in Michigan checking in on construction jobs, as part of the couple's small business. A wrong turn took them near Canada, where they say U.S. Customs Border Patrol detained both Sergio and Kristina, who is a U.S. Citizen. She was released after three days.

""When we were detained, my husband, they said, 'oh we're going to let him out in 48 hours,'"" she said.

But nearly three months later, she says her husband still remains in a detention center at the Monroe County Jail near Detroit.

""My husband is not a murderer, my husband is not a criminal. My husband is a very loving and good person,"" Kristina Ramirez said. ""I just am very upset, outraged by the injustice in this world. It just wrong how they have him there.""

Sergio's family says he's been a Chicago-area resident for two decades and currently has a pending U Visa application, in addition to being eligible for permanent residency through his wife. On Wednesday, his family and community leaders demanded he be released on humanitarian parole.

""This is a human tragedy about one family but is also an example of system that has run amok,"" said Ed Yohnka, Director of Communications and Public Policy for ACLU of Illinois.

Political pushback and legal challenges could lead the Trump administration to ease its crackdown and, thus, soften the impact, she said.
During the Great Recession, more Mexicans without authorized status left the United States than arrived.","For the first time in decades, more immigrants are leaving the United States than arriving, a new study finds, an early indication that President Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda is leading people to depart — whether through deportation or by choice.

An analysis of new census data released on Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that between January and June, the foreign-born population in the United States — both lawful and unlawful residents — declined by nearly 1.5 million. In June, the country was home to 51.9 million immigrants, down from 53.3 million six months earlier.

Officials from the Trump administration have applauded the net outflow, asserting that pressures on government services have eased and that job markets have rebounded. And some supporters of the immigration crackdown say it hasn’t gone far enough.

But experts predict looming negative economic and demographic consequences for the United States if the trend persists. Immigrants are a critical work force in many sectors, and the country’s reliance on them is growing as more baby boomers retire.

After campaigning on a promise of mass deportations, Mr. Trump has introduced sweeping measures to reduce immigration. His administration has restricted access to asylum at the southern border, tightened visa requirements for students and tech workers and deployed thousands of federal agents to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The crackdown has led immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and has discouraged others from coming.

Lillian Divina Leite, 46, chose to use the government’s new self-deportation program to return to Brazil. A housekeeper in Charlotte, N.C., Ms. Leite said that she had begun to panic when she saw immigrants being “hunted down like hardened criminals.”

“I got really scared,” said Ms. Leite, who had fallen out of legal status after overstaying a six-month tourist visa.

“I thought, I haven’t done anything wrong in my life,” she said, “and suddenly I could be imprisoned.”

Despite the study’s findings, Kevin Lynn, executive director of the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which advocates for less immigration, said that foreign workers who enter lawfully continue to pour into the United States and undermine Americans.

“There has been no letup,” he said. “People coming here legally, whether on green cards or employment visas, are impacting American workers at all strata, whether low-skilled or high-skilled.”

Net migration — the difference between the number of immigrants arriving and departing — has turned negative, a shift that the chief Pew demographer, Jeffrey Passel, called a “demographic certainty” so far in 2025. His team’s analysis did not calculate a separate number for undocumented immigrants, who seem likely to represent the largest number of departures, because heightened enforcement probably diminished immigrants’ participation in the census survey that was used to make estimates, he said.

They may have been undercounted, which would suggest the drop is not as severe, or their low participation could mask an even more striking decline.

The United States experienced negative net immigration in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, when between 400,000 and one million Mexicans and Mexican Americans left, many under coercive repatriation programs.

Whether negative net migration becomes a lasting phenomenon depends on how far the Trump administration goes to achieve its goals, experts say, but the Pew findings echo trends identified by other recent studies.

In July, the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute projected net migration in 2025 would be flat or would even drop and predicted that the Trump administration’s policies would continue to squeeze out low- and high-skilled foreign workers at least through 2026.

“A rapid decline in immigration is going to cause economic harm,” said Tara Watson, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the authors of the report.

Political pushback and legal challenges could lead the Trump administration to ease its crackdown and, thus, soften the impact, she said. But legislation recently passed by the Republican-controlled Congress has significantly increased funding for immigration enforcement, suggesting that the restrictive approach could extend throughout Mr. Trump’s term.

If so, “we could go into a spiral of continued decline,” said Ms. Watson, which could undermine U.S. competitiveness for global talent.

“If things are really bad, we no longer are the place where people go to do science or tech, and that could have generational repercussions,” she said.

On Day 1 in office, Mr. Trump signed several immigration-related orders. Since then, his administration has intensified efforts to curb immigration, and the president recently celebrated the prospect of negative net migration.

As he wrote in a Truth Social post on Aug. 4: “Promises made. Promises kept. Negative net migration for the first time in 50 years!”

In addition to targeting undocumented migrants, the administration has introduced measures that have undermined legal immigration.

It has paused the refugee program, which offered green cards and a path to citizenship to people fleeing persecution. It has increased screening and vetting of visa applicants, which experts expect will reduce the numbers of foreign workers and students.

The Trump administration has ended several Biden-era programs that had allowed people from troubled countries such as Haiti to live and work temporarily in the United States. Thousands of immigrants are set to lose their protected status in coming months.

Migration across the southern border, which had begun to slow under asylum restrictions imposed late in the term of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has declined further since Mr. Trump returned to office.

Employment opportunities have long been the primary draw for immigrants, with migration typically slowing during economic downturns. During the Great Recession, more Mexicans without authorized status left the United States than arrived.

But the current decline is unfolding in response to stringent policies and at a time when the United States needs immigration to offset a falling birthrate and an aging population.

“We have more and more people over 65 and not in the work force,” said Dowell Myers, a demography professor at the University of Southern California. “A new baby won’t help us for 20 years, but a young immigrant helps us immediately.”

“If you take a sledgehammer to the labor force by cutting immigrant flows,” he said, “we are all going to be seeing the consequences in our everyday lives.”

Restaurants, farms and assisted-living facilities are already grappling with labor shortages that could become more pronounced, he said. Many of those roles are filled by undocumented immigrants, whose population reached 14 million in 2023, according to Pew, and who accounted for 4 percent of the total U.S. population and about a quarter of the foreign-born population.

California had the most unauthorized residents in 2023, at 2.3 million, followed closely by Texas, with 2.1 million. Florida had the largest increase, adding 700,000 for a total of 1.6 million.

Through mid-2024, the unauthorized population continued to grow at a fast clip, before starting to contract following policy changes in 2025, according to a preliminary Pew analysis.

About half of the 14 million undocumented immigrants in 2023 had been in the United States for more than a decade, and 4.6 million U.S.-born children have parents who are in the country without lawful status.

Pew’s estimates are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data, including the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said last week in a news release that a decline in the population of undocumented immigrants “is already being felt nationwide, from reduced strain on public services to a resurgence in local job markets.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is holding a record 60,000 immigrants in detention, and that number is expected to soar as planned facilities open. Confined immigrants often agree to be swiftly deported rather than languish in custody while awaiting court rulings on whether they can remain in the United States.

Patrick Garcia, executive director of Embrace Carolinas, an advocacy group in Charlotte, N.C., is aware of at least 10 families who have self-deported to South and Central America.

“Something that was rare has become normal,” he said, adding that “my prediction is that departures will increase as Christmas and winter approach.”

“People are making as much money as they can to leave by the end of the year,” Mr. Garcia said.

Cratchit Aime, a Haitian immigrant in Springfield, Ohio, said he intended to return with his family to Brazil, where they had previously lived, to avoid being deported to his homeland.

Finally, on June 16, she received a call. Ms. Leite was booked on a United Airlines flight leaving on July 2 to São Paulo through Chicago. She landed in Brazil on July 3.

About two weeks later, she took delivery of $1,000 via Western Union.

“It’s a huge relief to be back home,” she said, adding that “police sirens still make me nervous.”

On social media, she has been busy offering tips for people who are eager to self-deport.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21nat-immig-decline-top-jfmc/21nat-immig-decline-top-jfmc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 12:11:33.479968

This is the third confirmed immigration arrest near a San Diego County School this month.

Federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested a man at the intersection of Park Dale Lane and Village Parkway around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. The man was on his way to work.

A video shared by the North County advocacy group Alianza Comunitaria shows bystanders asking to see an arrest warrant identifying the man. In the background, an agent said, ""It's a different guy.""

Later in the video, a bystander said, ""You said there would be a warrant."" The ICE agent responded, ""Not for him.""

Another video shows agents forcing the man into a truck as his wife and young daughter cry out for him.

Encinitas Union School District officials condemned the arrest. In a letter to parents, officials confirmed the man’s daughter is a student in the district.

“We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,” the district’s letter said.

State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, D-Encinitas, and Congressman Mike Levin, D-49, criticized ICE for the arrest.

Blakespear called it, “inhumane, barbaric and lawless,” while Levin demanded ICE provide, “a full and immediate explanation.”

The agency did not immediately respond to questions from KPBS.

As the videos circulated online, neighbors raised more than $25,000 so far to cover the family’s legal and basic living expenses through a crowdsourcing website.

“This working father and his family needs support from our community,” the fundraiser states.

Wednesday morning’s arrest is at least the third time federal immigration agents have arrested people near local schools. Similar enforcement tactics happened in Chula Vista and Linda Vista. News reports show similar arrests near schools in Oregon, Texas, Illinois and South Carolina.

At least one protester was detained, and two people, including a journalist, were hit with pepper spray by federal immigration officers Wednesday morning after a standoff outside the agency’s San Francisco office became violent.

Protesters first faced off with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers outside the nearby immigration courthouse at 100 Montgomery St. after officers arrested a man inside.

“Why are you disappearing our community?” one protester yelled as officers guided the man into a waiting van and began to drive away.

The protest escalated, spreading to the Financial District ICE field office, which is often used as a holding facility for immigrants detained across the Bay Area.

One protester outside ICE’s Sansome Street office was tackled, zip-tied and taken inside shortly after about a dozen people, who followed officers on foot the half-mile from the immigration court, arrived.

Minutes earlier, as the group walked toward the office, an officer pepper-sprayed both a protester and a journalist.

About two blocks north of the immigration court, Gazetteer reporter Eddie Kim told KQED he was sprayed in the eyes while trying to record an altercation between an ICE officer and a protester. He said a person rolling a bicycle alongside the group was walking calmly when an ICE officer reached out and grabbed hold of the bike’s handle.

The officer then sprayed the protester and Kim with a pepper spray gel.

“It wasn’t provoked,” Kim told KQED. “It’s not like the bike was being moved to hit the agent or get in their way. It was just a person just walking with the group … There were no aggressive movements other than me approaching the scene.”

Altercations between ICE and protesters outside the downtown court and field office have grown increasingly common since federal agents began arresting asylum seekers reporting to the buildings for mandatory status hearings and check-in appointments — a tactic that was unheard of until earlier this year.

In recent weeks, officers have also detained multiple protesters as tensions have escalated. Last Friday, two people were pinned to the ground and handcuffed before being walked into the Financial District ICE office.

“It’s also very clear that when people mobilize, it affects ICE in a major way,” Kim said. “They’re clearly affected by the presence of protesters to the point where they’re willing to deploy force against people who are not even an active threat.”

After hearing reports around 8:30 a.m., Wednesday, that a man had been arrested inside the immigration court building, protesters first gathered outside on Montgomery Street, standing in the way of the building’s lower-profile side door in an attempt to block ICE officers’ path to a line of waiting vans.

One protester who refused to stand back from the door was shoved to the ground, while another was pushed away toward the street.

Masked officers exited the building with the detained man, who was dressed in a suit and had his hands secured behind his back. They escorted him to the vehicle as protesters yelled for them to stop.

Protesters popped a front tire of the van before it took off south down Montgomery Street, along with two other vehicles. One officer yelled that a protester who ran down the street had a knife, and the officer reached for his gun but did not unholster it.

At least 20 protesters moved into the streets and crosswalks surrounding the court building, attempting to block the vans’ path. Some held bicycles and others stood in front of cars, trying to keep them in place.

An ICE officer shot a weapon, producing a white powder into the leg of a protester jostling with others over a bike.

We're going to keep making America safe,” Lyons said Wednesday in an interview on the ""Howie Carr Show.""

Asked if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning something similar to President Donald Trump's recent takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., Lyons said there would definitely be more of an ICE presence in Boston in the wake of Wu's comments this week.

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

Patricia Hyde, Boston's acting ICE field office director, also spoke Wednesday about Wu's comments, appearing in an interview on Fox News.

""Sanctuary policies don't make anyone safer, they don't make the community safer,"" she said. ""As far as, you know, the City of Boston and Mayor Wu not backing down, the men and women of ICE are not backing down.""

""I know what a safe Boston looks like, and this isn't it,"" Hyde added. ""This is a public safety crisis. Sanctuary policies don't make anyone safer... The men and women of ICE, unlike Mayor Wu, we took an oath and we swore to uphold our oath to protect the cities and communities where we work and where we live, and that's what we're going to do, despite the obstacles.""

Wu posted a response to Hyde's comments on Bluesky on Thursday morning, saying ""Actually I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States with my hand on @bpl.boston.gov's 1782 edition Aitken Bible--also known as the Bible of the Revolution.""

The U.S. Department of Justice sent out letters last week giving Boston and other sanctuary cities until Aug. 19 to submit a plan of compliance. The agency threatened to pull federal funding and even file civil suits if Boston did not comply.

Wu released her written response on Tuesday morning and held a press conference at City Hall Plaza, flanked by other local leaders, including U.S. Sen. Ed Markey.

""Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures,"" Wu said. ""Boston will not back down from who we are and what we stand for.""

In her letter, Wu said that the courts have consistently held that local public safety laws like the Boston Trust Act, which prohibits local police from working with federal agents if there is not a criminal warrant, are ""valid exercises of local authority and fully consistent with federal law.""

In the latest case, armed men in bulletproof vests arrested a father in front of an Encinitas elementary school Wednesday morning while his young daughter watched, officials said.

In a video of the incident posted to Instagram by a parent group, the men, at least one with his face covered, can be seen pulling a man dressed in a neon orange safety shirt and work boots out of a pickup truck.

The incident occurred at Park Dale Lane Elementary in Village Park, at 7:30 a.m., after the father had left the drop-off line, local officials said. During the arrest, bystanders asked the agents for a warrant signed by a judge; they apparently did not provide one.

The men making the arrest wore labels on their vests that referred to federal agencies. One was marked “ERO,” which is the acronym for Enforcement and Removal Operations, an arm of ICE. Other vests said “ATF,” the acronym for another federal law enforcement agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the arrest.

In a statement, state Senator Catherine Blakespear said the men making the arrest “appear to be federal police working for ICE” but they did not show identification, and they gave no reason for the arrest. The man had just pulled over to drop his daughter at school, Blakespear said, when agents “abruptly separated him from his child and family.”

“This is inhumane, barbaric, and lawless. We should all be outraged,” Blakespear said. She referred to the current state of the country as a “police state… where any person can be apprehended on the street without probable cause for arrest.”

Andrée Grey, the superintendent of the Encinitas Union School District, said in a statement that the arrest, which was witnessed by parents, students and school staff, had caused an atmosphere of “fear and trauma.” Grey said the district’s policy is to not share any information with authorities unless through a court order or judicial subpoena.

In a statement posted to social media, the Parents of Encinitas Union School District said the man’s daughter “has suffered a life-altering loss” and is “a victim of policy.” The group posted a gofundme link to help the family.

If the arrest is immigration-related, it marks a pattern of at least three incidents outside schools in San Diego County in the last two weeks.

On August 6, ICE arrested a woman while she was dropping off her child at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista, and on August 14, ICE made a similar arrest of a father outside Linda Vista Elementary.

After the Linda Vista raid, ICE responded to Times of San Diego and said that any rumors that ICE agents were targeting the school were “smears.” School superintendents argue that even if the arrests happen just outside school grounds, instead of on school property, their proximity still deeply affects the community.

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing ICE to make arrests in schools, churches and hospitals, areas that had previously been off-limits to protect essential services and prevent disruptions for children.

In a statement responding to the arrest at Park Dale Lane Elementary posted on social media, U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, D-Carlsbad, said that raids at schools like this one are “wrong and unacceptable,” and that he had personally asked the Department of Homeland Security to cease this practice. “No child should face that fear, particularly not when being dropped off at school,” he said.

When a parent is deported, a family may face a choice of whether a child will stay with a qualified family member in the U.S., move to a foreign country or enter the child welfare system.

Speaking on “The Howie Carr Show” Wednesday, Lyons said his response to Wu’s stated intention to defy the federal order is that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly referred to as ICE, is “going to keep making Boston safe, as she’s failing to do with the sanctuary city policies.”

“We did Operation Patriot March which yielded over 1,000 arrests, and now you’re going to see more ICE agents come to Boston to make sure that we take these public threats out that she wants to let go back in the communities,” Lyons said. “We’re going to keep making America safe.”

Asked by Carr if ICE was planning to “surge” the city of Boston akin to President Donald Trump’s crime crackdown in Washington, D.C, where ICE agents have reportedly appeared alongside the National Guard and federal agents, Lyons said there would be a larger presence in Boston following Wu’s remarks on Tuesday.

“We’re definitely going to … flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “Boston and Massachusetts decided to say that they wanted to stay sanctuary. Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger ICE presence.”

Lyons’ radio interview represented one of the first indications of how the Trump administration is reacting to a defiant press conference held by Mayor Wu on City Hall Plaza Tuesday, when she stated that the city has no intention of complying with Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order to dismantle its local sanctuary law.

“The U.S. Attorney General asked for a response today, so here it is,” Wu said at the press conference. “Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law, and Boston will not back down from who we are or what we stand for. We will not back away from our community that has made us the safest city in the country.”

Bondi had given Wu a Tuesday deadline to respond to a letter she sent last week to leaders of cities and states identified by the Department of Justice as sanctuary jurisdictions, with an order to “eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal law enforcement.”

In Boston, the law on the books enshrining its sanctuary status since 2014 is the Trust Act, which prohibits local police and other city departments from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when it comes to detaining illegal immigrants on civil warrants.

City officials say the law still allows for local cooperation with the feds on certain criminal matters like drug, weapons and human trafficking.

But Lyons said ICE has been finding that the state of Massachusetts, including Boston, has been ignoring ICE detainers or releasing “criminal aliens” convicted of crimes in the United States and abroad back into society, while again referencing the nearly 1,500 illegal immigrant arrests made during Operation Patriot.

“So not only do we have to go ahead and go after the ones we were targeting, but we have to also deal with jurisdictions releasing criminal aliens in real time while we’re out there working the streets,” Lyons said. “It’s not making anyone safer.”

Lyons also stated that Boston Police, while prohibited in some instances from cooperating with ICE by way of the city’s Trust Act, is often helping federal authorities “behind the scenes,” unbeknownst to Mayor Wu.

Those Boston police officers can’t cooperate openly with ICE out of fear of “getting in trouble or getting fired,” Lyons said.

“That’s the issue we’re seeing in so many jurisdictions,” Lyons said. “We have so many men and women on the Boston Police Department and other jurisdictions that are so pro-ICE, that want to work with us and that are actually helping us behind the scenes.

“And that’s what I think local leaders don’t understand, is they need to talk to the men and women on the ground, because … there are so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that the local law enforcement have to deal with. We can take that violent criminal alien instantly out of the neighborhood,” the ICE director added.

Attorney General Bondi has also threatened to prosecute city officials and withhold federal funds unless Boston cooperates with mass deportations, Wu said at Tuesday’s press conference.

Bondi elaborated on potential consequences for Boston and other identified sanctuary jurisdictions that failed to comply with her directive on a Monday Fox News appearance.

“If they don’t comply with us, we’re going to work with other agencies to cut off their federal funding,” Bondi said. “We are going to send in law enforcement just like we did during the LA riots, just like we’re doing here in Washington, D.C. And if they’re not going to keep their citizens safe, Donald Trump will keep them safe.”

Wu said on a “Java with Jimmy” podcast appearance Wednesday that efforts to cut federal funding to cities that the president dislikes are illegal, as the $300 million in federal funds Boston relies on each year is earmarked through Congress based on census counts that determine how much money is allocated to municipalities.

She also mentioned that, as mayor, she was enforcing a local law, the Trust Act, that had been on the books at the city and state level prior to her administration, since 2014, “and we’ve done fine in that period when it comes to safety.”

At her press conference, Wu said Boston was prepared should the federal government seek to intervene in the city’s law enforcement efforts, while referencing the National Guard deployment in recent months to LA and D.C.

“We also stand with those cities as they sue over his abuse of power,” Wu said. “We have reviewed those cases and we are prepared to stand up for our city’s rights if we need to.”",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Immigration_Deportations_37501_73d0b7.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-21 10:52:09.688178

by Deirdre Schifeling, she/her, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer, ACLU

Earlier this summer, Congress approved its most harmful budget in a generation. H.R. 1 or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” made the biggest cut to Medicaid since it was created in the 1960s and funneled that money to fund President Donald Trump’s racist anti-immigration agenda.

Instead of strengthening Medicaid, Congress took an axe to it. Instead of reining in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abuses, Congress gave the agency billions more to terrorize our communities and detain families.

As Congress returns to their home states to meet with constituents and conduct in-district business during the August recess, the preceding six months must be top of mind. Representatives are facing the judgment of their constituents and must answer for their actions: did they capitulate to the Trump administration, or did they fight back? In turn, the American people must make clear that lawmakers’ attacks on our health care and civil liberties are unacceptable.

Below, we outline what you need to know about this year’s devastating federal budget bill — and how we can fight against this attack.

Cuts to Medicaid Threaten Our Lives

Medicaid is a critical resource across the country, especially for children and people with disabilities. Politicians’ vote to cut Medicaid, a program that provides coverage for an estimated 70 million patients, means that in every single state and congressional district, people are closer to rationing medication, missing essential medical treatments, and losing access to the care they need.

Unsurprisingly, the most vulnerable among us will feel the brunt, including 12 million people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid. Medicaid coverage is a lynchpin to ensure people can exercise their right to live in their own homes, rather than dehumanizing institutions. Denying these supports and care forces people into institutions, stripping them of the liberty and autonomy our Constitution protects.

Martha Haythorn, a 25-year-old woman with Down syndrome from Georgia, is among the people whose freedom is endangered by cuts to Medicaid. She shared with the PBS Newshour that Medicaid helps her access her community. “I deserve to be there,” she said. “Without these benefits, I can’t do that. Is it really worth taking away someone’s benefit, someone’s life, someone’s accommodation?”

Courtney Leader of Missouri told CNN that she wrote to her senator, Josh Hawley, to share how Medicaid has helped her keep caring for her daughter, who has brain damage and cerebral palsy, at home. “Without Medicaid, we would lose everything — our home, our vehicles and, eventually, our daughter,” she wrote. Sen. Hawley was one of the 50 Senators who voted to cut Medicaid.

Medicaid also covers care for the two-thirds of people living in nursing facilities, and for the nearly 14 million people with mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Millions more could lose insurance coverage because of unclear rules and red tape created by new paperwork requirements and related reporting systems for Medicaid coverage.

The impact of H.R. 1 will be felt by people across the country, regardless of their incomes, for decades. Medicaid and other federal funds limited in H.R. 1 keep rural hospitals open, support medical training and clinical research, and ensure that people can get the care they need throughout their lifetimes. Finally, Congress’s cuts reduce the federal share of Medicaid funding, forcing states to cut services to meet budget shortfalls and further compounding the harm to our communities.

Access to health care is essential to our bodily autonomy and our freedom. Without these essential programs, our right to live fulfilled lives and control our futures will be greatly diminished.

Additional Risk to Reproductive Freedom

H.R. 1 also carries out one of the most dangerous goals of Project 2025: “defunding” Planned Parenthood by banning Medicaid patients from using their insurance there. This ban not only means that Medicaid patients can’t use their insurance for birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing, and other preventive care at Planned Parenthood — it also puts access to abortion access at risk even in states where abortion is legal.

A federal court blocked this “defunding” so Medicaid patients can continue to use their insurance for care at Planned Parenthood for now, but the legal battle will surely continue. If Planned Parenthood is truly “defunded,” hundreds of health centers would close, including a quarter of the country’s remaining abortion providers. Patients already struggle to access abortion, and, without Planned Parenthood, that could get even worse.

The ability to access timely reproductive health care will also worsen. There simply are not enough health care providers to serve the millions of patients seen by Planned Parenthood. The Trump administration has already attacked other essential reproductive health providers by withholding funds in the Title X family planning program, leaving patients with even fewer options for care. As a result, patients face longer wait times, travel, and delays in care.

For patients like Jamie Benner-Clemons, “defunding” Planned Parenthood could mean the difference between life and death. Benner-Clemons went to Planned Parenthood when she did not have health insurance. The cancer screening she received caught her breast cancer before it was too late. “The urgency of the health center staff saved my life,” she shared with Planned Parenthood.

Cuts to Medicaid will further endanger pregnant people nationwide. Medicaid covers 40 percent of births in the U.S. Without this coverage during pregnancy, many women would not get essential prenatal care. In rural areas, especially, these cuts will make pregnancy more dangerous. Dr. John Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, a remote city of about 4,000 people, told The 19th, that “already we’re seeing [pregnancy care] deserts that are increasing in size, and after the passage of this bill those are going to be markedly worse — where people are going to have to drive hundreds of miles before they can get prenatal care, much less delivery.”

Cutting Health Care to Fund Detention Camps and Deportations

The politicians who supported H.R. 1 took health care away from millions, while giving $170 billion in taxpayer dollars to an immigration police force larger than most of the world’s militaries and detention camps that could, over time, hold 750,000 children, immigrants with legal status, and other long-time residents from our communities. This sends a clear message that, for politicians, care for people with disabilities is out, while $50,000 bonuses for new ICE agents are in.

This budget will reshape, perhaps permanently, immigration enforcement and detention in the U.S., funneling $45 billion into private prison companies and mass tent cities where few people can find a lawyer. This administration has already cut funding for services for unaccompanied children.

At a time when there are increased deaths in custody and appalling conditions at some of the new immigration camps, ICE is already cashing in on its new allowance and is set to expand detention to almost 110,000 beds in the next six months. This is dangerous and unprecedented. We need members of Congress to bring oversight to these expanding sites.

Meanwhile, in multiplying the number of immigration agents on our streets, H.R. 1 is funding a police state where parents — including U.S. citizens — who take their kids to school or the hospital may be asked to “show their papers” by masked agents or even be detained in private prisons and tent cities without counsel or due process.

We’ve already seen how the Trump administration’s immigration machine is terrorizing our communities. Masked ICE agents across the country have refused to provide identification during arrests, where they have forcibly taken people away in unmarked vehicles and left families with no information on where their loved ones are or whose custody they’ve been taken into. Already, there have been numerous cases of people impersonating ICE officers to threaten and harm people who are immigrants. As these raids and arrests grow more common and more aggressive, it is essential that immigration agents can be identified as such, which is why the VISIBLE Act — a commonsense transparency measure that requires DHS and ICE agents to wear visible identification — was just introduced in the Senate. As ICE agents multiply around the country with this new budget windfall, Congress must pass this bill immediately to protect community safety.

Americans Will Hold Congress Accountable

The politicians who voted for this budget monstrosity chose to sacrifice their constituents’ health, rights, and dignity. The American people will hold them accountable.

This August, the ACLU and our partners hosted events across the country to call out the politicians who supported this reckless attack on our health care, our civil liberties, and our very ability to survive. ACLU People Power volunteers mobilized their communities to town halls and confronted their Congress members about their decisions.

In Colorado, 50 constituents walked into Representative Jeff Hurd’s district lobby, holding signs and leaving hand-written notes at his office.

In Arizona, constituents attended a town hall hosted by the ACLU of Arizona in Representative David Schweikert’s district. Speakers and constituents alike focused on the $170 billion turbocharge of the president’s deportation machine, which has been fraught with abuses of power by the federal government and was paid for through cuts to Medicaid for people with disabilities.

Recent public polling demonstrates how extremely unpopular this bill is with Americans across the country. Two-thirds of the American public (64 percent) opposes H.R. 1. We must make this opposition clear to Congress by showing up at public events, calling, writing, and visiting congressional offices to let politicians know how unhappy constituents are, and how much H.R. 1 hurts our communities, our rights, and our society.

Republican leadership in Congress are preparing to create a multi-billion dollar slush fund for the Trump administration to use as their budget, as well as attach countless policy riders that risk our civil rights and liberties. We have the opportunity to tell our representatives to vote no on any of these poison pill spending bills that restrict our rights and we must. Join People Power today to stay informed about what Congress is up to and how you can get involved to protect all of our rights. Together we will fight and win.

ICE officials told 25 Investigates that 42-year-old mother of three Jemmy Jimenez Rosa was transported from Maine to Burlington, Massachusetts for her release.

She is out and home with her family tonight.

“A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation’s laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused,” a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said. “Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with previous criminal convictions may be subject to mandatory detention and/or may be asked to provide additional documentation to be set up for an immigration hearing.”

Rosa’s family says she was detained on August 11 at Logan Airport while returning from a family vacation in Mexico with her husband and their three young daughters. She was in custody until Wednesday, August 20.

Husband Marcel Rosa, a U.S. citizen, says he handed over all the passports and his wife’s green card when they landed at Logan. He says his wife came to the United States legally from Peru at the age of nine, and she has held a green card ever since. The US Government renewed her green card again in July. Still, he says an officer pulled Jemmy aside for additional questioning. She was taken into a room alone.

“I walked in, and my wife’s head was just down, and you could tell her whole spirit was just crushed,” he recalled.

Jemmy was held at Logan for four days without access to her medication, a phone call, or even a shower before being transferred to a facility in Maine, according to her family and their attorney.

Rosa says his wife suffers from high blood pressure, is diabetic, and takes medication to treat mental health conditions. She has been hospitalized twice for treatment during her detention at Logan, Rosa says.

25Investigates reporting on those allegations caught the attention of Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch

“This case obviously raised some red flags in terms of the delay and what services are available to her as a legal permanent resident,” Lynch said.

Lynch explained he was told by CBP agents that Jemmy did not request a phone call.

“That’s sort of a weak excuse; they should have informed her of that right,” Lynch said. “There were some medical issues that needed to be addressed. Those were not addressed until she was transferred up to Maine.”

Lynch also explained that he was told Jemmy was brought to Maine because there were no open beds in any similar Massachusetts facilities.

25 Investigates has asked CBP and ICE officials twice regarding the allegations of Jemmy’s detention, but has not heard back.

Rosa says when his wife was detained initially, the officer brought up a decades-old marijuana case. At age 20, Jemmy pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession and served probation.

However, 25 Investigates was there when Jemmy’s criminal record was wiped clean this week.

Her attorney argued in Massachusetts District Court that Jemmy wasn’t given proper counsel when she agreed to the plea 22 years ago. The judge and prosecutor agreed.

With that decision, her attorney filed a motion with the federal court to release Jemmy. He says after that, and one day after 25 Investigates reporting, he was notified that ICE was preparing for her release.

Lynch told Boston 25’s Kerry Kavanaugh that he hopes to visit Logan Airport to see the holding areas.

“Definitely worth looking into, especially where there’s a delay to getting a person access to medical care,” Lynch said.

The family has launched a GoFundMe to help cover legal and unexpected expenses.

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act puts farm workers and their families on a pathway to legalization.","Known as the “Gateway to Cheese Country” and the “Cheese Capital of the USA,” the community of Monroe is a central part of Wisconsin’s dairy history. Besides this fame, the town of 10,000 or so also shares a lot with other small towns in the Midwest. Drive around the city’s courthouse square and you’ll see the offices of local lawyers, some banks and a few bars.

One thing that sets Monroe apart is the area’s relatively recent influx of immigrants.

According to the Applied Population Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Green County, where Monroe is located, has experienced a 229% increase in Latinos from 2000 to 2019. That growth has not been accompanied by a surge in murders, robberies, pet-eatings or any other crimes that the current administration has leveled against migrants. Instead Monroe has seen a rise in the number of Mexican restaurants and bilingual masses at the local Catholic church, as well as hardworking community members hoping to make a better life for themselves.

Which makes the recent events at Monroe’s W&W milk processing plant especially infuriating. Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) acquired W&W earlier this month , and workers describe an ownership philosophy vastly different from the positive work environment and commitment to employees they experienced under the previous owners. Short of formally firing the workers employed there, DFA instituted the E-Verify system as part of their management plan, possibly to avoid the Trump administration’s destructive crackdowns. While this system allows employers to confirm the employment authorization of new hires, employees taking part in the walkout say that in contrast to the previous owners, DFA is requiring verification of all employees, even those who have been there 10-plus years. Not surprisingly, DFA’s decision has triggered a strike and the formation of a legal assistance fund for workers who most likely will lose their jobs after years at the plant.

Across rural America

It’s not an isolated instance; immigrants are being unjustly targeted in similar ways elsewhere in rural America. In Long Prairie, Minnesota, a town much like Monroe, meat processing workers, many of whom received legal status to work with the humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration created for people experiencing potential violence or harm in Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, or Haiti, had their permits revoked by Trump. Hundreds of workers also lost the legal right to work in the United States at a JBS pork production facility in Ottumwa, Iowa, as the current government ended their Temporary Protection Status (TPS). Like humanitarian parole, TPS, which began in 1990, grants people from certain countries work permits who flee disasters like hurricanes or wars.

Throughout the Midwest, milk processing and meat packing firms in rural areas constitute an agro-industrial archipelago where workers, many of whom are immigrants, play a key role in making our food system operate. But instead of being rewarded for years of hard work, immigrants face persecution. Insisting on programs like E-Verify — a voluntary system with documented shortcomings — and removing legal protections terrorize hardworking people. Immigrants and their families deserve better, including legal pathways to remain and work in the country.

In a nutshell, revoking legal protections unfairly turns workers into criminals by making them ineligible to work here. More to the point, these tactics are par for the course when it comes to the current administration’s cruel, underhanded and racist approach to enforcing our country’s outdated immigration system.

This toxic mix of cruelty and racial profiling is on display when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrest immigrants at courthouses after their asylum cases are dismissed, making them vulnerable for deportation. The racial profiling is even more blatant when migrants are stopped outside schools or at Home Depot parking lots because of how they look and where they are. Some get thrown to the ground and handcuffed just because they question the reason they are being detained.

An endless vicious cycle

The problem with such tactics — aside from the ethical and legal problems of encouraging government agents to trample on people’s constitutional rights — is efficiency. Immigration hardliners and Trump loyalists like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made it a goal for ICE to fill the for-profit deportation complex with 3,000 arrests per day, having no qualms separating families, arresting children or people who have been model citizens for decades.

ICE has a sordid history of workplace enforcement actions in the past that have proven widely unpopular and non-productive.

We can go back to the Bush administration’s mass raids in places like Worthington, Minnesota, and Postville, Iowa, to show how ICE agents’ large-scale enforcement actions in rural communities tear families apart and leave communities with a long process to heal culturally and economically. What we know over a decade later is that arresting and deporting hundreds of people in such ways does not lead to U.S. citizen workers taking the positions formerly held by immigrants, but the deported people being replaced by, well, another round of immigrants.

But for Trump 2.0, plans for the agro-industrial archipelago are different. Instead of staging mass actions to arrest workers, the government is doing this work digitally. Put otherwise, a faceless bureaucracy revokes programs and permits, giving a contrived legal pretext for ICE to enter communities and arrest people.

Let’s be clear — immigrant workers at these places were trying to “do it the right way.” But this government effectively took the legal carpet from under them as they were trying to scrape a living together for themselves and their families. To threaten these people with deportation is the ultimate in punching down, terrorizing hardworking and community-building people we should be welcoming instead of demonizing.

Real immigration policy reform does not underhandedly manufacture undocumented people, or target people who contribute to the economy, but involves doing the hard work of creating fair, workable policy in Congress. Nor should immigrants be welcomed on a whim of the administration as was the case when white South Africans were given refugee status while suspending protections for thousands of others. Why this special treatment? Most people seeking refugee status are people of color — the South Africans are white.

There are various serious initiatives currently in Congress that could actually improve the lives of immigrants. The bipartisan Dignity Act provides a pathway for citizenship for DREAMers (youth who came to the U.S. without authorization and either attend college or plan to do so) and a work permit system for all other undocumented people. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act puts farm workers and their families on a pathway to legalization. California U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla’s more sweeping Renewing Immigration Provisions of the Immigration Act of 1929 grants lawful permanent resident status — green cards — to people who have lived in the U.S. continuously for at least seven years and do not have a criminal record.

Immigrants come to this country for a variety of reasons, including suffering the effects of flawed trade deals, as well as experiencing war and famine. Many continue to suffer here, working jobs that are ill-paid and dangerous in places like Monroe and Long Prairie. Our current government oppresses them further with draconian and dishonest tactics, scoring cheap political points instead of engaging in actual law enforcement.

Those among us who really care about public security should think long and hard on how this government is entrapping immigrants instead of reforming and enforcing the law.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-19_Monroe-Cheese-workers-Protest_Wisconson-Bailout-the-People-Movement.-Bryan-Pfeifer.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 08:56:52.741959

Walworth County has historically been cooperative with ICE efforts, drawing criticism from ACLU of Wisconsin.","A court commissioner in Walworth County says he was forced out of his position after he asked to see an immigration arrest warrant from a sheriff's deputy trying to take a man into custody.

Peter Navis, the county's circuit court commissioner for the past four years, said he resigned after he was told he could voluntarily leave or be fired over the July 15 incident in his courtroom.

The incident is the latest flare-up between judges and the Trump administration as it conducts a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. And it underscores the lack of universal rules on how to deal with immigration arrests in courtrooms.

One of the highest-profile examples is that of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan, who is charged with obstructing federal officers for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant elude arrest.

In the Walworth County case, Navis said he was told by three of the county's judges that Navis had misstated their position about whether immigration warrants had to be shown before an arrest can be made in court.

Judges appoint and can fire commissioners, who exercise similar functions as judges, such as accepting pleas and holding preliminary hearings, in the early stages of a case.

Navis said he was wrong to make a sweeping statement about the judges' stance, but said he stands by his position that deputies should have shown him a warrant before making an arrest.

""There is no avoiding this is a larger issue in the country about how these things are handled ... Every state and county in the country probably has to confront this issue,"" Navis, 45, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an interview.

""The fact that there were no discussions about how this would happen in Walworth County, and that it was happening in my courtroom for the first time, made it stressful.""

Navis recalled an emotional scene in his courtroom as he objected to the deputies taking the man into custody without showing a warrant. But Navis said he couldn't prevent it.

""They are the deputies,"" he said, ""so it's not like I could physically get down from my bench and stop them from doing it.""

Routine day at Walworth County courthouse turns stressful, chaotic

It was a typical traffic day in Navis' court on July 15. Between 30 and 50 people were crammed in the courtroom.

Then, about 15 minutes before the first case was to be called, a deputy told Navis that someone was going to be arrested on an immigration warrant, Navis recalled.

Deputies often make arrests in traffic court, Navis said, but usually on behalf of other counties. This arrest was for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Navis said he called Walworth County Judge Kristine Drettwan for guidance. Navis said Drettwan told him how she would handle the matter. He declined to share what Drettwan said.

She then told him he had authority to conduct matters in his courtroom ""as he saw fit,"" Navis recalled.

Drettwan did not return calls and emails seeking comment.

Navis said he asked the deputies about the arrest plan and to see the warrant. Deputies refused on both counts, he said.

""In other situations, the warrants were issued by courts in Wisconsin and they are readily available,"" Navis said. ""The type of warrant and authority claimed was different and that’s why I asking for it, to see if there was lawful authority.""

In a transcript of the hearing obtained by the Journal Sentinel, Navis said the sheriff's office was failing to follow a court order that deputies show a warrant.

""The failure to inform the Court of this impending action calls into question whether this Court can trust the Sheriff’s Office in the future,"" Navis said.

The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Andrew Herrmann, said Navis had no right to see the warrant.

Navis countered that the defendant, named in the transcript as Enrrique Onan Zamora Castro, was out on a signature bond but was now being detained without evidence of a warrant.

According to online court records, Castro, 33, of Milwaukee, was facing charges of operating without a valid license for the second time in three years. Wisconsin court records show he was previously convicted of felony stalking and disorderly conduct in Milwaukee County, in 2023 and 2025. He received probation in both cases.

Navis then added that he had been instructed by the county's judges to prevent an arrest without a warrant.

A short time later, ICE officers appeared with deputies to make a second arrest, according to the transcript.

At that point, Navis says, ""I’ve been instructed by the judges of this county to require warrants before individuals are detained in my courtroom.""

Judges, sheriff's office decline to comment

Walworth County Clerk of Courts Michele Jacobs, who learned of the incident soon after, said deputies routinely arrest people on warrants in the courthouse.

""Deputies were executing a warrant, something they have done for years in the courtroom ... The commissioner was asking questions about it and it became an incident,"" Jacobs said. ""It did not go the way it usually goes.""

Walworth County Sheriff Dave Gerber, who was elected in 2022, did not return calls and emails from a Journal Sentinel reporter seeking comment. A spokeswoman said the sheriff had no comment.

ICE officials did not respond to questions about the case.

The incident soon came to the attention of Walworth County's four judges: Drettwan, Daniel Johnson, Estee E. Scholtz and presiding judge, David Reddy. Scholtz beat Navis for an open judge's seat in April 2024.

Navis said Scholtz, Johnson and Drettwan met with him late in the day on July 21; Reddy was not present.

According to Navis, the judges said he misstated their position. However, Navis said they didn't ask him to explain and gave him an ultimatum: resign or be fired.

Jacobs, the clerk of courts, confirmed she too was at the meeting, but declined to comment because it is a personnel matter.

None of the four Walworth County judges returned calls or emails seeking comment.

Navis, who according to Jacobs made $138,195, formerly worked as a corporation counsel and a private judge.

The county is accepting applications for a new court commissioner and hope to have a new person hired in early fall, she said.

After Navis said he would resign, he was allowed to gather his personal belongings in the presence of a county employee and then was escorted out of the building.

""It was a very normal course of what we would do if someone resigned or terminated. They no longer have free reign of the building,"" she said.

Walworth County has historically cooperated with ICE, according to ACLU

Walworth County, home to about 100,000 people and located in south-central Wisconsin on the Illinois border, has been in the news before because of immigration.

As a wave of Nicaraguan immigrants arrived in the college town of Whitewater, critics including Donald Trump — who was not president at the time — blamed crime and other issues on the new arrivals. City officials disputed that.

Walworth County has historically been cooperative with ICE efforts, drawing criticism from ACLU of Wisconsin.

As Trump's immigration crackdown has continued, other Wisconsin counties have also found themselves caught between federal enforcement priorities and local authority.

In Milwaukee, ICE and other federal agents made several arrests in the Milwaukee County courthouse, raising questions about their authority in local courthouses.

In some cases, local prosecutors have clashed with federal immigration officials over attempts to deport crime defendants or witnesses before their cases conclude.

In Dane County, a woman who ICE says is in the U.S. illegally and is charged with drunk driving resulting in the death of two teens. State prosecutors are seeking to have the defendant returned to state custody to ensure ICE does not deport her before she can face charges.

In Milwaukee County, a man is charged with trying to get a victim in his case deported before he could testify against him.

In the case of Dugan, her legal team is arguing she was acting in her legal capacity as a judge. Both sides are awaiting how U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman will rule on the defense's motion to dismiss the charges.

Amnesty International has reviewed documentation which shows that AI tools Babel X and Palantir’s Immigration OS have automated capabilities that enable constant mass monitoring and surveillance, often for the purpose of targeting non-US citizens.

The human rights organisation added that its research shows how these tools are being used by the US government to track migrants and that the tools also “carry a high risk of being used as part of the ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative”.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio launched the AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” to cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups.

The AI-driven ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative combines social media monitoring, visa status tracking, and automated threat assessments of foreign individuals on visas, including international students.

However, critics warn that Pro-Palestinian sentiments have often been conflated with antisemitism or pro-terrorism, leaving people vulnerable to being caught in an AI-enabled social media net.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research at Amnesty International, said the “coercive ‘Catch and Revoke’ initiative risks supercharging arbitrary and unlawful visa revocations, detentions, deportations and violations of a slew of human rights”.

She also said it is “deeply concerning that the US government is deploying invasive AI-powered technologies within a context of a mass deportation agenda and crackdown on pro-Palestine expression”.

Babel X

Babel X is provided by Babel Street, which has partnered with 84% of US national security agencies.

Babel X can gather sweeping amounts of data from a single identifier, such as a person’s name, email, or phone number.

Amnesty said that information gathered by Babel X can be used by US authorities to make a decision about revoking an individual’s visa.

However, it warns that “probabilistic technologies used to draw inferences about individuals’ intent have massive margins for error, can often be discriminatory and biased, and could lead to falsely framing pro-Palestine content as antisemitic”.

Amnesty said that Babel X has been “tasked specifically with monitoring refugees and asylum seekers” and warns that it “risks rendering individuals suspicious by default, and subjecting them to the risk of visa revocation, detention and deportation”.

Immigration OS by Palantir

In April 2025, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $30 million contract to track “self-deportations” and identify priority deportation cases, particularly visa overstays.

The Immigration OS system serves as an upgrade to a previous Palantir system which had been used by ICE since 2014.

Amnesty claimed that the Immigration OS “automates an already deeply flawed and unaccountable process that has a history of disregarding due process and human rights”.

During the first Trump administration, in 2020, Amnesty International wrote to Palantir about its human rights due diligence processes.

In response, Palantir said it “shares your organization’s concern with the potential serious human rights violations against migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers at the US–Mexico border”.

‘Due diligence’

In July, Amnesty contacted Palantir Technologies and Babel Street for comment.

Babel Street did not respond, but Palantir Technologies said its product was not used to power the “Catch and Revoke” effort.

However, Palantir said its Immigration OS “does include work that directly serves” ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Amnesty said the “Trump administration’s public intention to engage in mass deportations” meant the companies “could have reasonably foreseen the risk of harm being seen across the country and reconsidered entering into these contracts”.

“Had Palantir and Babel Street adequately carried out human rights due diligence, these companies could and should have similarly declined to engage in these mass deportation efforts,” said Guevara-Rosas.

She called on Palantir and Babel Street to “conduct and publish the full findings of human rights due diligence processes” .

“Unless Palantir and Babel Street can demonstrate they can use their leverage as suppliers to improve the serious human rights consequences borne by the policies of their clients,” said Guevara-Rosas, “these companies should immediately cease their work with the US administration related to immigration enforcement.”",https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6795130/river/?height=400&version=6795199,N,,2025-08-21 06:56:44.972864

“Every year, you make us tell you how we help thousands of day laborers get jobs across the city.
The immigration raids in the valley have even extended to students and schools.","While residents celebrated 818 Day across the San Fernando Valley, a coalition of pro-immigrant organizations took to the streets outside Van Nuys City Hall to demand an end to federal immigration raids in the 818.

The “All Eyes on the Valley” rally on Aug. 18 brought attention to the predominantly Latino communities in the valley that have been terrorized by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

“There’s nowhere else I’d rather be on 818 Day than in these streets,” said Carla Orendorff, organizer with Aetna Street Solidarity and the San Fernando Valley Homeless Union. “Because we have so much to fight for, we have so much to live for and our resistance is life.”

Since the President Donald Trump administration chose to target Los Angeles in early June, the valley has seen increasing instances of unidentified masked men with no federal warrant arresting people off the street.

In fact, between June 6 and July 20, Panorama City was the most targeted area where the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) LA Rapid Response Network received calls from.

Many of those being detained are street vendors and day laborers, as federal immigration authorities target areas where they work, notably outside home improvement stores. Dozens have been detained in immigration raids outside the Home Depots in the City of San Fernando, North Hollywood and Van Nuys.

Megan Ortiz is the executive director of the Instituto de Educación Popular del Sur de California (IDEPSCA), a nonprofit organization that operates five of the seven day laborer centers in LA. Three of those centers are co-located with Home Depots.

“Across those day labor centers, they have been raided 12 times,” said Ortiz. “Six of the 12 raids at the Home Depot co-located day labor centers have happened at the Van Nuys Home Depot.”

These detainments can often be violent and dangerous. In Pacoima, a tamales vendor suffered a heart attack when Border Patrol agents grabbed her from behind; in San Fernando, a day laborer broke his leg when fleeing from ICE agents; and in Van Nuys, CBP agents broke windows and dragged laborers out of their vehicles.

Last week in Monrovia, Roberto Carlos Montoya died while fleeing ICE agents. The day laborer was handcuffed when he was hit by a car.

“Two federal judges have said that this is illegal,” said Cal Soto, workers’ rights director at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). “Today they continue to illegally arrest people on the corner based on the color of their skin, the language they’re speaking and the type of work they’re seeking. Shame!”

Raids are still taking place despite a temporary restraining order (TRO) being issued by a federal district judge and upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“I’m a lawyer. We’re fighting this case in the courts,” said Soto. “But I can tell you one thing, the lawyers and the judges are not going to enforce our human rights. It’s the people on the streets who are going to enforce it.”

Ortiz questioned why the city hasn’t done more to protect the day laborer centers, when these are spaces funded by the city.

“I would like to know from the office of the city attorney if I can obtain a protective order against my day labor centers,” said Ortiz.

“Every year, you make us tell you how we help thousands of day laborers get jobs across the city. You make us fill out a thousand reports telling y’all [about] all the money that day laborers are bringing to the city economy,” she continued. “Yet you are allowing, day by day, for these workers to be disappeared and stolen from our neighborhoods, from their families.”

Immigration authorities have also targeted those documenting and witnessing the raids.

At a raid outside the Lowes in Pacoima, one U.S. citizen was violently pulled out of his vehicle and detained by federal agents while documenting, spending hours in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody before being released. Days later, he still had marks on his wrists from the handcuffs.

At the Van Nuys Home Depot, one of the day laborers center’s staff members and three volunteers documenting the raid were arrested by federal authorities and held for 50 hours in the Metropolitan Detention Center before being released.

The immigration raids in the valley have even extended to students and schools.

Last week, outside Arleta High School, nearly a dozen masked Border Patrol agents detained, handcuffed and later released a 15-year-old San Fernando High School Student with mental disabilities who was waiting in a vehicle with his grandmother.

A CBP spokesperson claimed they were not targeting the school, but were conducting an operation aimed at a “criminal illegal alien,” whom they mistook the child for.

In Van Nuys, an 18-year-old rising senior at Reseda Charter High School was detained while walking his dog. He is still being held in custody while awaiting deportation.

“He is like many students who come here with a dream to do better. He should be starting his senior high school year right now, and instead, he is in detention, where he is afraid,” said Lizette Becerra, LA Unified School District (LAUSD) educator and former teacher of the teen.

“This is not what students need to be worrying about.

We would take bullets for our students. We will protect them from ICE.”

Demonstrators called for the release of illegally detained workers and an end to family separations; for Mayor Karen Bass to take action to protect immigrant Angelenos; protection of day laborers; a stop to the targeting of immigrant rights organizations; a ban on ICE at schools; and a cancellation of rent and mortgage payments for those affected by the raids.

The ""informational item"" – championed by Commissioner Jeremy Matlow, who recently announced his mayor campaign – would look into current litigation in South Miami that questions whether Florida cities and towns are required to enter immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. City staff would also consider the ramifications of Tallahassee piggybacking onto the lawsuit.

But there was deep concern from Commissioners Dianne Williams-Cox and Curtis Richardson over potential retaliation from Governor Ron DeSantis, who has ousted public officials who he says are thwarting Florida law.

Around 30 people filled the city commission chamber at City Hall to speak out against the controversial immigration agreement.

The agreement, according to the ICE website, allows ""ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to partner with state and local law enforcement to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S..""

Several speakers denounced the agreement and said they could no longer trust in local law enforcement. Others spoke on rising fears in the community following an immigration raid in Collegetown in May. Still others expressed disgust with the city for not putting the topic on the Aug. 20 agenda for a public discussion.

""We've seen U.S. citizens being stopped by law enforcement and unlawfully detained on the basis of their perceived ethnicity,"" said Alejandro Garcia. ""We've seen the opening of a massive detention camp in the Everglades and now a second facility being planned in Baker, all at enourmous cost to the taxpayer and with no other aim, it seems, except to deny these people being held their with adequate access to legal counsel.""

The group of speakers said that the decision at the meeting was ""a win"" and a step in the right direction.

Commission expresses concern over state level retaliation

To kick off the conversation sparked by public speakers, Mayor John Dailey expressed his stance on the matter: ""I will tell you I stand firmly, firmly against violations of basic human rights whether they're Tallahassee citizens, citizens of the state of Florida, the United States. I too look at what's going on across the country and I am very deeply disturbed of the videos that I'm seeing in other communities.""

Dailey asked TPD Chief Lawrence Revell to come to the podium to explain what it is local law enforcement does in the terms of the agreement, but comments from the audience such as ""shame"" and loud boos caused the mayor to shut down the discussion as he passed the gavel to Williams-Cox to address other topics.

After a short break, the board reconvened for public hearings and Dailey continued the paused conversation.

According to Revell, one officer has completed the training on immigration policies but has hit some hiccups in the credentialing process.

""(Staff) ran into some problems on the federal side, not our side. So as I understand, he is not credentialed... but we have complied with the training,"" Revell said. He continued saying there is no set amount of officers needed to partake in the training but of the 396 within TPD, they selected only one officer.

Richardson expressed concern about the governor and attorney general's threats toward commissioners and elected officials who sought to thwart the agreement.

""There was some (speakers) who indicated that we should state a position or take a position and if don't do that we would be afraid of being removed from office,"" Richardson said.

""I'm not going to speak for anyone else other than Curtis Richardson. It would not be in my best interest to put myself in a position to potentially be removed from office. The residents, the voters of this community that elected me to office, elected me to address all the issues facing our community,"" he continued. ""If put in that position, having to defend myself and pay those legal costs ... I am not willing to do that.""

Williams-Cox added that the community would not be served if sitting commissioners were ousted by the governor and replaced by ""folks who he knows will do what it is he wants to have done.""

""It's not that I'm scared, what it is is that you've got to be the adult in the room and understand that there are other things that we are responsible for ... other people are counting on us as well,""

Matlow took a more aggressive stance on the issue in comparison: ""I want to say we are not legally required to enter the 287(g) agreement. It's not in the legislation and it hasn't been affirmed by the court of law. I understand the governor and the attorney general have issued threats and made an opinion, but we're not a nation of kings, presidents nor governors are not kings.""

""In a moment in time when all across our community people our terrified, to not at least stand up and say let's ask a judge to affirm what Ron DeSantis is saying is accurate isn't the leadership we need to see in a city like Tallahassee.""

Resolution to take another stand on 'dehumanizing' immigration policy fails

Following the unanimous vote, Commissioner Jack Porter, who was attending online, urged her colleagues to pass a resolution similar to one passed by Miami Beach condemning the ""dehumanizing and violent rhetoric and targeting"" of immigrants.

""It's for the residents of Tallahassee to know where we stand on the issue,"" Porter said.

Dailey said he would need to study the Miami Beach resolution, adding that the commission had already made it clear during the meeting where it stood on the policies of the Trump administration.

The vote ended in a familiar 3-2 split, with Dailey, Williams-Cox and Richardson against creating a resolution.","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PTAL/83927568007-raid-at-const-site.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-21 09:57:13.635883

Since being sworn in for a second term in January, Trump has targeted top US universities over claims they are politically biased towards ""woke"" politics and has charged – without evidence – that they have engaged in antisemitic policies.

The administration has characterised widespread campus protests and sit-ins in the United States calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza as being ""antisemitic"", and moved to expel foreign students and professors who took part in them.

Trump has made the question of student protest, particularly by foreign scholars, a flashpoint political issue.

Two existing governors, Christopher J. Waller and Michelle W. Bowman, were appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term.","In addition to emails, text messages and voice mail records, the subpoena also requested any messages sent or received through the encrypted WhatsApp messaging service, as well as “similar applications.”

The records request revealed the extent to which the administration has sought to pierce powerful federal confidentiality protections for patients and their medical providers as part of the government’s pressure campaign to end all transition care for children.

Officials briefed on the investigation have previously described subpoenas to hospitals and doctors on transgender care as part of an effort to determine whether any laws have been broken, and to provide leverage for negotiations with health care providers who provide transgender care. Investigators could eventually seek criminal charges if evidence of fraud is uncovered, officials said.

The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s gender and sexuality development clinic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department investigations of pediatricians and children’s hospitals are just one component of the Trump administration’s campaign against pediatric gender care.

In May, nine leading children’s hospitals across the country received letters from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, demanding data on children’s gender-related treatments. Those letters applied explicit financial pressure to the hospitals, saying that “hospitals accepting federal funds are expected to meet rigorous quality standards.”

In June, the F.B.I. put out a call to the public to report hospitals and doctors who were performing gender-related surgeries on minors. Last month, a top Justice Department official announced at an event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission that manufacturers of drugs used in transgender care were under investigation for possible violations of drug marketing laws.

Even in blue states with laws that broadly allow such care, hospitals and clinics have sharply curtailed gender-related treatments for transgender youth amid the threats from the federal government. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, for example, shuttered its renowned clinic for transgender care last month.

Inside the Shake Shack, Mr. Miller declared that the jeering would directly result in the administration’s throwing more resources at lowering crime rates that Mr. Trump has called “totally out of control” but that have actually fallen sharply the past two years.

“I’m glad they’re here today,” Mr. Miller said of the hecklers, “because me, Pete and the vice president are all going to leave here and, inspired by them, we’re going to add thousands more resources to this city to get the criminals and the gang members out of here.”

The White House and Mr. Miller did not immediately respond to requests for comment on who would be joining the crackdown effort.

The shouting and booing provided a melodramatic foil for Mr. Miller and the other officials to cast themselves as fighting against a lawless city ruined by liberal maniacs. “All these demonstrators that you’ve seen out here in recent days, all these elderly white hippies, they’re not part of the city and never have been,” Mr. Miller said.

He cast the administration’s actions as being in the interests of the city’s Black residents, arguing that the crackdown would help people who are most affected by crime in the city. “This is not a city that has had any safety for its Black citizens for generations, and President Trump is the one who is fixing that,” he said. But so far, most of the troops have been seen near monuments and tourist zones — places like Union Station.

The train hall had fallen onto hard times during the pandemic with a rise in crime (it was seen as grim bellwether in Washington when the Starbucks in Union Station closed up shop) and has not rebounded as well as some of the other busier parts of the city.

In that way, it made for a handy backdrop for the officials’ impromptu news conference. They certainly seemed to make the most out of their clash with the yammering protesters in the station. “We’re going to ignore these stupid white hippies that all need to go home and take a nap because they’re all over 90 years old,” Mr. Miller said at one point as the defense secretary and vice president smirked.

Mr. Vance, for his turn, had this to say about the people who were booing him: “We’ve traded, now, some violent crazy people who are screaming at kids, with a few crazy liberals who are screaming at the vice president. But I think that’s a very worthwhile trade to make because we want our people to be able to enjoy our beautiful cities.”

He was asked whether the White House planned to extend the federalization of Washington’s police department beyond 30 days. Like other members of the administration who have been asked this question, he was noncommittal. “If the president of the United States thinks that he has to extend this order to ensure that people have access to public safety, that’s exactly what he’ll do,” Mr. Vance said.

A reporter pointed out to him that polls showed that most people in Washington were strongly opposed to the administration’s actions in the city.

“I don’t know what poll you’re talking about,” Mr. Vance said. “Maybe the same polls that said Kamala Harris would win the popular vote by 10 points.”

And then he said: “OK, we’re going to stop there. We’re going to grab a quick bite with some of the soldiers here in the National Guard.”

The Foreign Malign Influence Center, created by Congress in 2022, coordinates efforts across intelligence agencies to monitor threats to elections and public debate. During the last election, intelligence officials held regular briefings to warn of attempts by Russia and other countries to manipulate the vote in the United States.

The center also issued warnings about deepfake videos that spread false information about Vice President Kamala Harris, and about videos from Russia that sought to spread false claims about damaged ballots and illegal voting.

But Republicans have criticized the Biden administration’s election-defense efforts, saying that its attempts to counter foreign disinformation curtailed the free speech rights of conservatives. Early in the second Trump administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shut down its election-defense efforts, while Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the F.B.I. to dismantle its malign influence task force.

Even though the Foreign Malign Influence Center was created long after the 2016 presidential election, Ms. Gabbard has been deeply critical in recent weeks of its examination that year of Russian election interference. She has said the 2016 assessment was flawed, and has accused Obama administration officials of a “treasonous conspiracy,” comments that have earned Mr. Trump’s praise.

Because the center was created by Congress, it is difficult for Ms. Gabbard to eliminate it outright. Instead, the memo said she would fold its operations into another part of her office, called Mission Integration, that oversees national intelligence officers.

The reorganization plan also shrinks two other centers and folds them into the Mission Integration office. One of the centers is dedicated to cybersecurity, and the other focuses on chemical, biological and nuclear threats.

In a social media post Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Gabbard said her reorganization plan was a first step toward making her office more efficient and agile, saving taxpayers $700 million a year and “rooting out deep state actors.”

The memo said that the National Intelligence University, which is akin to a military war college that trains midcareer intelligence professionals, would enroll its final students in the fall. Over the course of the school year, it would move its academic programs to the National Defense University and other government schools. The National Intelligence University, based in Bethesda, Md., will close no later than June 1, 2026, the memo said.

The proposal immediately generated criticism on Capitol Hill among Democrats, many of whom were concerned about Ms. Gabbard’s decision on Tuesday to revoke the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, including two Senate staff members. Many of those affected had worked on Russia analysis or foreign threats to U.S. elections.

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was in need of “thoughtful reform,” and that he and his colleagues would review her plan.

“But given Director Gabbard’s track record of politicizing intelligence — including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials — I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,” Mr. Warner said.

Ms. Gabbard’s office said that so far, she had decreased the number of employees at the office from 1,800 to 1,300, a figure reported earlier by Newsmax. According to the memo to Congress, Ms. Gabbard’s office was extending voluntary early retirement until March 31, 2026, to further shrink the work force.

“It is my commitment to you, and my charge to the O.D.N.I. leadership team, that we will continue to drive efficiencies across the organization,” Ms. Gabbard wrote in the memo.

According to Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Ms. Cook obtained a $203,000 loan on a property in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 2021 and declared her intent to make it her primary residence. Two weeks later, according to a letter he posted on social media, she purchased an Atlanta condominium with a $540,000 mortgage and said that it would be her primary residence. The following year, the letter added, she listed the Atlanta condo for rent.

Mortgage lenders want to know if you intend to use a property as your primary residence. Generally, the best interest rates and loan terms (say, a 30-year mortgage instead of a shorter one) go to those people. If it is your one and only home, you are likely to do everything you can to make the payment each month.

Lenders will often charge a higher interest rate for a second home or a property you intend to use as a rental since the risks there are higher. If you run into financial trouble, after all, you will be more likely to stop making payments on the rental property than on the home where you live.

To Mr. Pulte, it “appears” that Ms. Cook has “falsified bank documents and property records” to get a better deal. A spokeswoman for the Fed did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Ms. Cook.

According to Rocket Mortgage, one of the biggest lenders in the United States, you can’t have two primary residences. People’s life circumstances can change quickly though, and it is fine to rent out your old home after purchasing a new one if the mortgage allows that. You are just supposed to make lenders aware of your plans and changing circumstances.

It is not unusual for people in the public eye to find themselves the subject of real estate scrutiny. This year, documents emerged showing that Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, declared three separate properties to be his and his wife’s primary residences. The Trump administration has lobbed similar accusations at Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, and Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California.

Prosecutions of such matters tend to be rare, but they are not unprecedented. Last year, Baltimore City’s former state’s attorney was found guilty of making a false mortgage application. In that case, the conviction hinged on the origin of the down payment funds.

Judge Berman said that although Trump’s Justice Department had argued that there was precedent for unsealing grand jury testimony, there were no “special circumstances” that would justify it — and that the transcript “pales in comparison to the investigation information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice.”

The department has already undertaken a “comprehensive investigation” and “assembled a ‘trove’” of documents, interviews and exhibits, the judge wrote.

“The government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein files,” Judge Berman wrote. Its request to unseal the meager transcript “appears to be a ‘diversion’ from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the government’s possession.”

The federal government has 100,000 pages of files and materials that “dwarf the 70-odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials,” the judge said. Indeed, the Justice Department is to begin providing some files about the Epstein case to lawmakers on Friday, the chairman of the House of Representatives’ main investigative committee said this week.

In the six years since Mr. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial, his death has inspired myriad conspiracy theories.

His proximity to powerful people inspired conspiracy theorists who have promoted the idea that America is controlled by a cabal of politicians and the wealthy. His death in federal custody, which was ruled a suicide, has also spurred improbable notions about an assassination.

Top aides to Mr. Trump championed some of those theories before they entered government, and Mr. Trump had promised to release information about the investigation. However, the administration’s failure to disclose any revelations has threatened to drive a wedge between the president and some of his most fervent supporters.

The Justice Department announced last month that it had closed an “exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein.” The review “revealed no incriminating ‘client list’” or evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,” the department and the F.B.I. said in an unsigned memo. The government indicated that there would be no more disclosures about Mr. Epstein.

The announcement set off a furious backlash.

The issue effectively brought the House to halt last month, but Republican leaders expressed hope that the Trump administration’s requests to release grand jury testimony might mollify hard-right lawmakers and their constituents, who believe the material will implicate Democrats.

But before lawmakers left for their August recess, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for its files on the Epstein case. The department said it would begin providing files to the committee by Friday — but the grand jury materials will remain secret.

Grand jury evidence, tailored by prosecutors to make their case, is presented in proceedings that almost always remain secret.

The Trump Justice Department’s request that Judge Berman unseal the transcripts was among several made to federal courts in New York and Florida in recent weeks, part of an effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to stem criticism that the government was hiding information.

Judge Berman’s opinion came about a week after a different Manhattan judge denied the government’s request to unseal transcripts from its investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime companion of Mr. Epstein. Ms. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sexually exploiting and abusing teenage girls in concert with Mr. Epstein.

In July, a federal judge in Florida denied a request by the Justice Department to release transcripts from two federal grand juries there that investigated Mr. Epstein in 2005 and 2007.

Confidentiality was a central concern for the judges considering the Justice Department’s requests.

The judge overseeing Ms. Maxwell’s case, Paul A. Engelmayer, said that unsealing grand jury materials “casually or promiscuously” would erode confidence in people called to testify before future panels.

In his opinion, Judge Engelmayer said the Justice Department’s argument that the grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information was “demonstrably false.”

Doing so, in fact, “would expose as disingenuous the government’s public explanations for moving to unseal,” he wrote.

Echoing his colleague, Judge Berman said that the grand jury testimony in Mr. Epstein’s case was “merely a hearsay snippet.”

Michael Gold contributed reporting from Washington.

“In the past, the agency and department secretaries have always, or almost always, followed that guidance,” Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who leads the committee, said in an interview. “But in this administration, it is clear that we need to move far more of that language on how the money should be spent into the bills themselves.”

The changes may not survive negotiations with the House, where Republicans have been far more deferential to Mr. Trump. And they may not have a chance to be enacted, given the White House’s determination to have its way on spending. But proponents say that at the very least, the safeguards could strengthen the position of Congress in future legal battles over funding.

The guardrails are largely technical and include putting instructions into legislative text that would have previously been spelled out in nonbinding reports.

For example, officials say that detailed tables on spending for major agencies such as the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services are now being added to the text of the bills themselves, to try to assure that the funds are used for their specified purposes. The guardrails also include significant new requirements for reporting to Congress on terminating contracts and grant awards, as well as for making substantial reductions in the federal work force.

The changes come as the White House Office of Management and Budget and its director, Russell T. Vought, have sought to assert extraordinary executive branch control over spending, arguing that the levels set by Congress are a ceiling, not a floor. Mr. Vought has said that congressional negotiations need to be less bipartisan, and has called the decades-old budget law empowering Congress on spending unconstitutional.

That claim is disputed on Capitol Hill, where the congressional power of the purse is considered paramount.

“I believe members of Congress who know their districts and states should decide how taxpayer dollars get spent — not faceless political appointees, and not any president who wrongly believes they hold the power of the purse instead of Congress,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. She said she would continue to press for more restraints on the administration.

In March, Ms. Murray joined Ms. Collins in a letter to Mr. Vought protesting his unilateral decision to not spend nearly $3 billion in emergency funds out of a $12 billion allocation by Congress, arguing that he was overstepping his power.

Along with Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, they also challenged the budget office’s decision to take down a legally required website tracking the administration’s disbursement of money. An appeals court recently upheld a ruling ordering the White House to put it back online.

The website has since been restored, though Democrats say that not all the required information is available. Ms. Murray said the website shows that the White House has tried “to secretly and illegally exert even more control over funding approved by Congress.”

Even with the stronger language being added in the Senate, lawmakers cannot be certain that the White House will follow their directives. But Ms. Collins noted that the new safeguards would bolster Congress in any legal fight with the White House over intent with funding. “Then there is much stronger grounds if there is a lawsuit,” she said.

As August winds down, Congress is about to enter a critical phase of its spending debate ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline. For the first time in years, the Senate earlier this month considered individual spending bills on the floor, and approved three relatively noncontentious measures on military construction, agriculture programs and congressional funding.

When Congress returns after Labor Day, lawmakers would like to make more progress, though approving and sending the 12 annual spending bills to Mr. Trump is not a realistic possibility. That means Congress will either have to agree to extend funding at its current levels, or the government will shut down.

Other factors could intercede to complicate the fight. Senate Republicans have said that they intend to try to change rules governing confirmations in order to clear a backlog of nominees, a decision likely to embroil the chamber in a partisan fight. And the White House is threatening to cancel more congressionally approved funding by the end of the fiscal year, which could upend critical spending talks.

Ms. Collins said the White House should refrain from doing so, and leave the cutting to Congress.

“We understand that spending needs to change over time, but you don’t exclude the appropriations process,” she said.

She and other lawmakers say they believe their best case for protecting the spending power of Congress is to pass the annual spending bills with specific instructions, and have Mr. Trump sign them into law. Operating under what is known as a continuing resolution, as the government is now, provides the White House with more discretion to determine spending levels. Members of Congress say they want to limit that flexibility.

“If Congress thinks we should be more specific — and I happen to think we should be more specific with our appropriations directions — then we have to pass appropriations bills, not a continuing resolution, for the coming year,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota and a member of the Appropriations Committee.

If those bills pass and are signed into law, Ms. Collins said, “it is the way the system is supposed to work.”

The scientist, Vinh Nguyen, was one of 37 current and former national security officials whose security clearances were revoked on Tuesday. Many, though not all, had tangential connections to the intelligence agencies’ review of Russian efforts to influence and meddle in the 2016 election.

Ms. Gabbard has released documents about that intelligence inquiry and accused Obama administration officials of related crimes, an effort Mr. Trump has praised.

Lt. Gen. William J. Hartman, the acting N.S.A. director, called Ms. Gabbard in the days before the revocation and asked to see the evidence that Mr. Nguyen, the agency’s chief data scientist, had done anything that merited the revocation of his security clearance.

Ms. Gabbard rebuffed the request, the officials said. The list of people losing their clearance began to circulate Tuesday morning and was made public in the afternoon.

The N.S.A. referred all questions to Ms. Gabbard’s office, which did not return a request for comment.

Former officials have criticized the revocation of the 37 security clearances and the wider purge of national security officials. In an article in The Atlantic published on Wednesday, William J. Burns, the former C.I.A. director and a longtime diplomat, said the removal of public servants was part of a campaign of retribution.

“It is about breaking people and breaking institutions by sowing fear and mistrust throughout our government,” Mr. Burns wrote. “It is about paralyzing public servants — making them apprehensive about what they say, how it might be interpreted, and who might report on them. It is about deterring anyone from daring to speak truth to power.”

Mr. Nguyen, the son of a South Vietnamese general who fought alongside American forces in the Vietnam War, was recruited as a 17-year-old high school student to join the National Security Agency because of his math skills.

He rose through the ranks of the agency to become its chief data scientist. Friends and former colleagues of Mr. Nguyen said he had been in charge of developing artificial intelligence systems to improve the gathering of foreign communications. He has also been involved in the intelligence community’s work on quantum computing, which has the potential to break current encryption systems and revolutionize espionage.

In the days before Mr. Nguyen was dismissed, N.S.A. officials were concerned that his job was at risk, as conservative publications began to look at his work as the national intelligence officer in charge of cyber in 2016.

Reports in conservative publications had led to the ouster of the N.S.A.’s top lawyer, April Falcon Doss, in July. And the previous director of the agency, Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, was fired in the spring after Laura Loomer, the far-right conspiracy theorist, accused him of having ties to Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Former officials had expected General Hartman, who replaced General Haugh, to be nominated for the job permanently. But neither the Pentagon nor the White House has formally made that move.

There is no evidence Mr. Nguyen mishandled classified data, made poor analytic judgments or politicized his work. However, his role in the analysis of Russian election meddling in 2016 has been a focus of conservative news media, which under Ms. Gabbard has been enough to cost N.S.A. officials their jobs.

Mr. Nguyen’s job became endangered after Ms. Gabbard released a series of statements from an intelligence analyst about Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The analyst had questioned whether Russian attempts to hack computer networks linked to voting systems were given too little attention in the Intelligence Community Assessment being prepared after that election, according to officials.

“After being directed to conduct analysis of Russian-attributed cyberactivity for the I.C.A., I had been abruptly directed to abandon further investigation,” the analyst wrote, referring to the Intelligence Community Assessment.

The analyst worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency but had been assigned to work on the cyber team in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

In an article published on Aug. 8, Real Clear Investigations identified Mr. Nguyen as the analyst’s supervisor. The report suggested that Mr. Nguyen was likely to be the supervisor who had told the analyst that other Russian influence activities — not the hacking of voting systems — were a critical part of its campaign to meddle in the 2016 election.

Ms. Gabbard has charged that after the election, intelligence officials changed their view of Russian efforts to interfere. But in reality, officials did not change their views; they shifted their focus to Russia’s influence efforts.

During the campaign, intelligence analysts were most concerned about the potential for Russia to hack into election systems and change votes.

But after the election, analysts determined that Russia had largely abandoned its efforts to use cyber to directly hack the election infrastructure. Instead, intelligence officials began more closely examining Moscow’s efforts to influence the election through social media campaigns and, most critically, by releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee.

Neither Mr. Nguyen nor his other intelligence officers were directly involved in producing the Intelligence Community Assessment, according to former officials.

The effort to draft the assessment was rushed, with President Barack Obama wanting the work completed before he left office.

Mr. Nguyen had no involvement in the judgment that Republicans have taken issue with: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia favored Mr. Trump’s election.

In any case, most of the analytic work was done at the C.I.A., not at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where Mr. Nguyen worked, according to former officials.

In attacking Ms. Cook, the first Black woman to ever serve as a Fed governor, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pulte signaled anew their willingness to weaponize the instruments of government to influence monetary policy, even though experts long have warned that interfering with the Fed and its independence could bring about catastrophic economic and financial consequences.

The attacks fit a broader pattern for Mr. Trump and his top aides, who have increasingly targeted their political rivals, subjecting them at times to withering investigations and other forms of political retribution.

Mr. Pulte, despite holding what is typically a relatively low-profile role in the administration, has been particularly aggressive, leveling similar mortgage-fraud allegations against Adam Schiff, a U.S. senator who led congressional inquiries into Mr. Trump during his first term, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, who won a civil fraud trial against Mr. Trump before he returned to office.

In a statement released by the Fed on Wednesday evening, Ms. Cook said she had learned about Mr. Pulte’s allegations from media reports, and noted that the mortgage applications were from before she joined the Fed board.

“I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” she said in the statement. “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

A Justice Department official confirmed the agency had received the referral.

When it comes to the Fed, Mr. Trump’s goal is to force down interest rates, which he believes will boost the economy and make repaying the government’s debt less expensive. The Fed has instead kept its benchmark borrowing costs steady this year, in part because officials are concerned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will prompt a new round of price increases.

To achieve his goal, the president has embarked on an all-out campaign to pressure the Fed and its members, relentlessly lambasting its chair, Jerome H. Powell, and threatening to fire him, while also trying to subject the central bank to uncomfortable public scrutiny.

Mr. Trump recently seized on renovations underway at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, which are running around $700 million over budget and are expected to cost around $2.5 billion. The president visited the construction site in July after questioning whether there was evidence of fraud given the project’s swelling expenses. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump threatened to allow a “major lawsuit” against the Fed chair related to the renovations to go forward as he again called for lower borrowing costs.

The president is limited in his ability to remove an official from the central bank, a protection recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. Policymakers on the Board of Governors can be removed only for “cause,” which legal experts define as breaking the law or gross misconduct.

Ms. Cook has consistently voted with Mr. Powell and is generally seen as aligned with him on policy decisions. Ousting Ms. Cook, whose term as governor runs through 2038, would give Mr. Trump another seat on the seven-member board that he could fill with someone more likely to support cutting rates.

Mr. Trump already has had one seat to fill. Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor, resigned unexpectedly this month, several months before her term was set to expire in January. Mr. Trump has said he plans to nominate Stephen Miran, currently the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill out Ms. Kugler’s term. He would need to be confirmed by the Senate.

The White House has also started weighing potential replacements for Mr. Powell, whose term as chair ends in May. On Tuesday, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said there were “11 very strong candidates” under consideration, and told CNBC that he would begin meeting with them around Sept. 1 to narrow the list.

The chair has historically exerted significant influence over monetary policy decisions. But officially the position has just one of 12 votes on the Fed’s policymaking Open Market Committee, which is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors and a rotating group of five of the presidents of the Fed’s 12 regional banks.

Two existing governors, Christopher J. Waller and Michelle W. Bowman, were appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term. So if Mr. Trump were able to replace both Ms. Cook and Ms. Kugler, he would have appointed a majority of the board. The governors, in turn, must approve candidates to lead the regional Fed banks, although it isn’t clear whether they could immediately force out existing presidents.

A specialist in international economics who has researched racial disparities in labor markets, Ms. Cook was a professor at Michigan State University when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appointed her to the Fed board in 2022.

Her confirmation was a narrow one: Vice President Kamala Harris broke a 50-50 tie in the Senate after Republicans voted overwhelmingly against her appointment.

One of the most prominent Black women in a field long dominated by white men, Ms. Cook has been an advocate for diversity in economics. She helped lead the American Economic Association’s summer program, which helps prepare students from underrepresented backgrounds for graduate programs in the social sciences.

In a letter posted Wednesday to social media, Mr. Pulte revealed that the housing agency had been investigating Ms. Cook on suspicion of mortgage fraud. It was the latest instance in which Mr. Pulte, a key political ally of the president, had personally targeted a member of the Fed; earlier, he helped stoke suspicion around Mr. Powell and drafted a letter for Mr. Trump firing the chair. The president ultimately opted not to dismiss Mr. Powell.

Mr. Pulte said his inquiry had found that Ms. Cook obtained loans for two homes in 2021 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Atlanta and indicated that both would be her primary residence. Ms. Cook later listed the latter dwelling for rent in 2022, according to Mr. Pulte, who cited “online records,” claiming she did not report any rental income on her ethics filings at the time.

In her most recent financial disclosure, Ms. Cook listed three mortgages, all of which she obtained in 2021, with interest rates ranging from 2.5 to 3.25 percent. She reported receiving income from rent on her residence in Ann Arbor in reports filed in 2024 and 2025.

Mr. Pulte echoed Mr. Trump’s calls for Ms. Cook to resign, posting at one point on X: “How can this woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?”

Mr. Trump has himself been found liable for lying to lenders to secure more favorable interest rates. A judge in New York last year found that Mr. Trump had inflated his net worth on loan applications, and imposed a fine of about $450 million, including interest. Mr. Trump has appealed the ruling.

“He’s a war hero, because we work together. He’s a war hero,” Mr. Trump said of the Israeli leader. “I guess I am too,” he added.

Israel in mid-June launched waves of airstrikes against Iran, hitting important nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan. It killed much of the country’s military chain of command along with several nuclear scientists. Then, on June 22, the United States used large bombs to strike the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo, which is buried under a mountain.

A recent U.S. assessment described Fordo as badly damaged, although it is difficult to precisely gauge the extent without access to the site.

During the interview, Mr. Trump also took credit for the return of hostages held in Gaza who have been freed since his election victory in November.

Hamas freed around 30 hostages during a cease-fire that began just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, and another captive was released in May on the eve of the president’s visit to the Middle East.

They were among 240 hostages taken during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that set off the war in Gaza. About 105 hostages were freed during an earlier cease-fire, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. was president.

“I’m the one that got all the hostages back,” Mr. Trump said.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister, in November 2024, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel has rejected the accusations, and the State Department in June imposed sanctions on four of the court’s judges in response to the warrants.

Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has frequently taken credit for resolving conflicts including those between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, between India and Pakistan and between Thailand and Cambodia. He also announced the cease-fire between Iran and Israel that ended the nearly two weeks of back-and-forth strikes in June.

In the interview with Mr. Levin, Mr. Trump said: “I’ve settled six wars, and we did Iran, and I wiped out their total nuclear capability, which they would have used against Israel in two seconds if they had the chance.” He compared that record favorably with those of his Democratic predecessors.

Iran has long said that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes. Though its ability to enrich uranium, which is needed for a nuclear weapon, was set back significantly by the U.S. and Israeli attacks, some experts believe that Tehran could eventually resume enrichment at other sites.

In response to the interview, Iran’s Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with the country’s Revolutionary Guard, on Wednesday described Mr. Trump’s remarks on Iran as “incoherent.”

When asked about the possibility that critics might call the heat-inducing paint job cruel, Noem said: ""Don’t touch it.""

Noem said the request to paint it black came from President Donald Trump.

""Too high to climb. Too narrow to squeeze through. And now, at the President's direction, it will be painted black – so hot to the touch that criminal illegal aliens won’t even try,"" Noem said in a post on X.

As USA TODAY has previously reported, hundreds of miles of 30-foot barrier at the border already pose a deadly threat to migrants who attempt to scale the fence.

Still, thousands of migrants have tried since President Donald Trump ordered construction of the 30-foot barrier during his first term.

During a historic period of migration following the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022, the county hospital in El Paso, Texas, treated 326 people for injuries – or nearly one per day.

Some of the injuries were catastrophic: Nine people died that year after falling from the fence, which is roughly the height of a three-story building. From 2000 to 2019 – before the higher barrier was erected – the hospital registered a single death resulting from a fall from the border fence.

Coyote smugglers have taken to throwing rope ladders over the 30-foot barrier or using steel rods shaped to hook over the fence. Increasingly, they're tunnelling under the barrier.

Noem didn't tell reporters how much the paint job will cost. She praised Trump's war on illegal immigration, which Noem said has resulted in ""the most secure border in our nation's history.""

Illegal crossings have fallen dramatically border-wide under Trump's crackdown.

Migrant apprehensions have plummeted to fewer than 8,000 in July, compared with more than 104,000 during the same month a year ago, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

In El Paso Sector, which includes West Texas and New Mexico, interim Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar said the seven-day average for apprehensions currently sits at around nine, compared with around 400 at the same time last year.

She and her attorneys filed a lawsuit hoping the judge would compel police to enforce the city's noise ordinances and crack down on criminal activity near the ICE building.

Attorney Julie Parrish said for more than 70 days, her client, Cloud Elvengrail, has put up with yelling, loud bangs and people pounding on her door. Parrish said Judge Ellen Rosenblum's bench ruling essentially left matters up to the police officers' discretion, even though the judge felt for the plaintiff.

Parrish said the ruling was disappointing for Elvengrail who believes the city's noise ordinance from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. should apply to the noise she hears most nights.

""I don't think what we were asking for was unreasonable,"" said Parrish. ""We filed a writ of mandamus asking a judge to compel Portland police to do their job.""

Parrish believes police may be taking a cue from city leadership by allowing certain criminal activity by protesters to slide.

KGW contacted police and the city for reaction to the judge's decision.

In a letter sent to the local ICE field office Tuesday, the Sacramento City Council and Sacramento County Board Chairman Phil Serna said they had received reports of confined individuals held in “abhorrent conditions” at the John E. Moss federal building. Those conditions allegedly include limited water and food and a lack of access to restrooms and air conditioning.

“In light of this situation, we are requesting transparency on the conditions of the detained individuals … as well as access to tour the facilities to ensure the humane conditions and treatment of these individuals,” officials wrote in the letter.

The letter follows several reports from NorCal Resist that immigrants are being held overnight as part of their detainment. The organization, which has spent months monitoring arrests at the federal building, said there are estimates of more than 20 people who have been held in these conditions.

“It is important to note that this building was not designed for overnight stays,” said Giselle Garcia, programs director for NorCal Resist. “We denounce this practice and advocate for the immediate release of these community members.”

ICE, in an email statement on Friday, said the “query will be researched” but could not respond before The Sacramento Bee’s deadline when asked about NorCal Resist’s allegations. The agency did not respond to multiple follow-up emails this week.

Councilmember Eric Guerra, who spearheaded the letter, said he is hoping for an immediate response that allows elected officials to review the conditions of the facility.

“If someone is being held in unsanitary or unhealthy conditions, days matter and hours matter,” Guerra said.

The alleged conditions at the Sacramento federal building mirror recent accounts and videos that immigrants across the country are being kept inside immigration offices for consecutive days. In many cases, these offices are designed to only hold people for a few hours.

A Peruvian immigrant filed a lawsuit denouncing the unsanitary and overcrowded conditions in New York earlier this month, according to The New York Times.

In Sacramento, immigrants have already spent the last few months carefully navigating the downtown federal building which holds offices for several agencies including ICE. Federal authorities have taken people into custody at the building since late May.

The center launched an oversight program, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to provide states with reports of individuals enrolled in Medicaid who do not appear on federal databases.

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

States are required to review the federal reports, identify immigration status discrepancies, request information and enforce noncitizen eligibility rules.

Federal law typically does not allow noncitizens to enroll in Medicaid. However, 1.4 million people are enrolled in Medicaid who do not meet citizenship and immigration status requirements, according to data from the Congressional Budget Office.

Some states, like California, Oregon and Colorado, have extended Medicaid eligibility to undocumented immigrants, which accounts for the large number of recipients. It is unclear how cooperation will go between states who have expanded Medicaid enrollment.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” said CMS administrator Mehmet Oz.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law July 4, implemented tighter restrictions on Medicaid eligibility including a crackdown on work requirements for able-bodied adults, frequent eligibility redeterminations and increased restrictions on noncitizens.

The move from the health department comes as the Trump administration has worked to share more data on individuals enrolled in Medicaid. The health department first gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to enrollment records for individuals on Medicaid in June.

Twenty states, including California, Colorado and New York, filed a lawsuit against the department in July. A federal judge temporarily blocked the health agency from sharing information in those states last week.

“Using CMS data for immigration enforcement threatens to significantly disrupt the operation of Medicaid—a program that Congress has deemed critical for the provision of health coverage to the nation’s most vulnerable residents,” Judge Vince Chhabria wrote in the order.",https://heartlandernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Medicaid-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 02:56:55.313779
