In the letter, Attorney General Nessel stressed that the fair administration of justice depends on public participation, which requires unfettered access to courthouses.
Attorney General Nessel also addressed the amendment’s implications on civil immigration enforcement.
The Attorney General stressed that ICE’s historical compliance with such policies shows that civil enforcement operations can continue effectively without courthouse arrests.
Attorney General Nessel also noted that the proposed amendment would not invalidate ICE warrants, interfere with judicial warrants, or prevent civil arrests outside courthouses.","LANSING – Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel sent a letter to the Michigan Supreme Court yesterday in support of the Court’s proposed amendment of Michigan Court Rule 8.115, which would generally prohibit civil arrests of individuals who attend court proceedings or conduct other business in a courthouse. In the letter, Attorney General Nessel stressed that the fair administration of justice depends on public participation, which requires unfettered access to courthouses. Creating an environment where people fear civil arrests – whether they are victims, parties, witnesses, or simply courtroom observers or those doing business in the courthouse – discourages participation, undermines accountability, and erodes trust in the justice system.

“When people are afraid to report crimes or come to court because they fear a civil arrest, it puts victims at risk and makes our communities less safe,” Nessel said. “It’s my sincere hope that the Michigan Supreme Court adopts this amendment to protect access to justice for everyone.”

The Attorney General noted that several states already provide similar protections, including New York, Connecticut, and Illinois. Attorney General Nessel also addressed the amendment’s implications on civil immigration enforcement. The broad language of the proposed rule would limit certain civil arrests by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in administrative and non-criminal matters within courthouses. She cited recent federal litigation upholding New York’s courthouse protections, where the Court recognized that ICE’s own prior policies acknowledged that courthouse arrests can deter individuals from reporting crimes or pursuing civil rights claims.

These prior federal policies, Attorney General Nessel noted, restricted civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses to limit circumstances in order to preserve access to justice. The Attorney General stressed that ICE’s historical compliance with such policies shows that civil enforcement operations can continue effectively without courthouse arrests.

Attorney General Nessel also noted that the proposed amendment would not invalidate ICE warrants, interfere with judicial warrants, or prevent civil arrests outside courthouses. Any impact on ICE operations, she concluded, would be minimal and far outweighed by the need to protect the public’s fundamental right to participate in the justice system.

The letter can be found on the Department of Attorney General’s website.

That changed on Friday, when the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency allowed two Democratic congressmen from New York to get a firsthand look at the cells on the 10th floor at 26 Federal Plaza, in Lower Manhattan.

Representative Daniel Goldman arrived at the building, trailed inside by a throng of reporters and armed with a court ruling that ordered ICE this week to allow federal lawmakers to visit detention centers without notice.

After knocking on the 10th-floor doors for a few minutes, Mr. Goldman was escorted inside by the leaders of the ICE field office in New York, while journalists waited outside. Another Democratic congressman, Adriano Espaillat, showed up shortly after and was also let in.

Emerging from their visit, the lawmakers said that the four cells, which have held thousands of migrants this year, were holding just nine detainees on Friday. They said that federal workers, probably because of the congressional visit, were mopping the floors: “It was spick and span,” Mr. Goldman said.

The conditions, they said, appeared to have improved since a federal judge ordered ICE in August to limit the number of migrants being held to 22, following reports that hundreds of migrants had spent days at a time there earlier this year.

But Mr. Goldman criticized the lack of showers or beds in the cells for detainees. “You’re essentially sleeping on the hard floor with blankets, thin blankets,” he said.

He said that Kenneth Genalo, the ICE field office director in New York, told the lawmakers that about 60 percent of the people ICE detains in New York have no criminal histories. Many were arrested by the agency at immigration courthouses or after being summoned to check in at the ICE offices.

“ These are not violent criminals, and what ICE is very clearly doing is targeting the easiest people to arrest, detain and deport, which are not the criminals,” Mr. Goldman said at a news conference after the visit.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shut out of power in Washington, Democrats in Congress have sought to use their oversight powers to scrutinize immigration detention facilities, hoping to exert political pressure on President Trump and his growing mass deportation campaign.

Detention centers across the United States have reached record levels of capacity, holding more than 65,000 migrants as of late November. From California to New York, the centers have emerged as political flash points amid reports of overcrowding, poor conditions and inadequate access to health care.

Mr. Goldman, and other Democratic members of Congress, had been demanding access to inspect the cells at 26 Federal Plaza since June, showing up several times, only to be denied access by ICE. The lawmakers accused the agency of violating federal laws that allow members of Congress to tour facilities where migrants are being held.

ICE repeatedly argued that the lawmakers did not have a right to visit the cells because they were not technically in a detention facility, but rather inside the agency’s New York field office, where migrants are processed and held temporarily.

On Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington ruled that ICE must allow members of Congress — whose access to detention compounds has been restricted across the country — to make unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities.

In her 73-page ruling, the judge, Jia M. Cobb, an appointee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wrote that the agency’s attempt to block lawmakers from ICE field offices where migrants are being detained, even if temporarily, was “contrary to statute.”

The New York holding cells began drawing scrutiny during the summer, as ICE launched a sprawling effort to detain migrants who were showing up for routine court hearings at immigration courts that are just a few floors above the holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza.

The pace of arrests overwhelmed the limited capacity of the holding cells, which are cramped and bare spaces traditionally used by ICE to hold detainees for just a few hours before transferring them to detention centers outside the city.

But the cells became packed with hundreds of migrants. They were held for days, sometimes for longer than a week, in violation of the agency’s own guidelines, which limit stays at such facilities to 72 hours. Many were forced to sleep on the concrete floor or sitting upright, according to migrants, lawyers and video footage that emerged in July.

A lawsuit filed on Aug. 8 accused ICE of holding migrants in squalid conditions, without access to lawyers, proper meals, bedding or showers, and subjected to a “horrific stench” from the metal toilets inside the cells.

The lawsuit led a federal judge to order ICE to swiftly remedy the conditions inside the cells at 26 Federal Plaza on Aug. 12. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, appointed by President Bill Clinton, ordered the agency to limit the number of migrants it holds there to 22, and to ensure that they have access to proper medical and hygienic care.

During Mr. Goldman’s visit on Friday, he said that he spoke to a Pakistani man who had been detained during his annual ICE check-in. The man, Mr. Goldman said, had been in the United States since 1995 and had been ordered removed from the country by a judge in 2007, but never left.

The man claimed he did not have a criminal record, and was worried for his wife and four U.S.-born children.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/19/multimedia/19met-congress-ice-01-lvzg/19met-congress-ice-01-lvzg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 14:57:43.463179

The four were among a group of about 20 who had gathered at the ICE facility, near the Burlington Mall.

Representatives from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for comment about this case and what the policy for such packages is a Burlington ICE.","Two Arlington residents were among four people charged Tuesday after they tried unsuccessfully to deliver care packages to detainees held at the Burlington ICE facility.

Roger Rosen and Eric Segal, both town residents, joined Sabine von Mering and the Rev. Fred Small, who were arrested by Burlington police officers.

“We want those who are detained to know that they are not forgotten, not now and not in any season,” the Rev. Sarah Lusche told GBH News. She is the senior minister at Old Cambridge Baptist Church and a licensed clinical social worker who was present when the four were arrested. “That’s what today was about — attempting to care for these members of our community who are being detained without due process by this administration’s regime of immigration terror.”

Lusche said the packages contained food, juice, hats, bedrolls and menstrual products. The latter two items, she said, were in response to media reports of detainees sleeping on concrete floors, and in the case of menstruation, “being made to sit in their own blood.”

“They were then told that they needed to leave the property and the group, very calmly and peacefully, said they were going to stay and wait there until they were able to deliver the packages,” she said.

The Burlington Police Department confirmed to various media outlets that the four were arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace on Tuesday at 11:15 a.m.

The four were among a group of about 20 who had gathered at the ICE facility, near the Burlington Mall. “All four were told repeatedly to disburse from the front entrance and refused to do so after multiple attempts,” Police Chief Thomas Browne told GBH. “They knew they would be arrested and ultimately were, and then booked at our facility.”

According to The Boston Globe, https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/17/metro/burlington-ice-facility-arrests/ an officer wrote in the police report: “All four were directly in front of the main doors reading from a piece of paper. I repeated my advisement to move and Segal, Small, Von Mering and Rosen refused to do so.”

Segal and Rosen said the four did not block the entrance, citing photos they provided.

According to a police, The Globe reported: “DHS ICE would not take any property or supplies due to not being able to properly vet everything.”

Rosen has worked with families from Haiti and El Salvador in the United States and is a climate organizer. Segal is a retired tech executive who is known for helping immigrants. Von Mering is a climate activist, mother and naturalized citizen. Small left parish ministry in 2015 and is active in human rights advocacy.

“The irony of the disturbing the peace charge is lurid,” Rosen told YourArlington. “ICE, which violently disturbs the peace of every community it targets, is not held accountable for the violent cruelty of its unconstitutional abductions, while those who peacefully bring baskets of food and necessities to our immigrant sisters and brothers in need in the holiday season are swiftly arrested and handcuffed.

In a statement reported by GBH, Small wrote: “Masked ICE agents abducted Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk less than a mile from my home. Jesus told us to welcome the stranger. Instead, ICE is brutalizing our neighbors with wanton cruelty. In this Christmas season, I want to light a candle of kindness and compassion.”

“The blatant physical and emotional cruelty of ICE operations demands that we step outside our comfort zone to object,” Rosen wrote. “Our attempt to deliver these necessities to our immigrant brothers and sisters is a recognition of their humanity and their right to be treated with kindness and respect.”

Immigrants that have been detained and released from the Burlington processing center have shared reports of crowded cells, as well as lack of access to on-site medical attention and medication.

Most immigrants detained in the state go through the facility. Some high-profile stays included Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, an 18-year-old Milford high school student detained for six days and many of the immigrant employees of Allston Car Wash. One man, Dairo Preciado, said he slept on an air mattress that felt half-inflated so he could feel “metal bars under his back” and cried as he spoke of his experience there.

The building opened in 2007 and was approved under the town’s zoning code to temporarily hold immigrants for only a few hours. But the increase of immigrant detentions across Massachusetts has yielded greater numbers of people being brought to the center to be processed, and many of them have remained there for days, or even weeks.

U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton and Sen. Ed Markey have visited the facility, calling on the agency to improve conditions there and allow immigrants to meet their attorneys, family and clergy in-person.

A group of protesters, including some from Arlington, has been showing up Wednesdays since last spring.

A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a pro-Trump legal group seeking access to a trove of federal judiciary documents, including from a body overseen by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts – putting an end to a protracted legal fight brought by Trump allies seeking to access key judicial documents.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee assigned to the case earlier this year, dismissed the long-shot lawsuit brought by the America First Legal Foundation, the pro-Trump group founded by White House policy adviser Stephen Miller after Trump’s first term; Miller, now back in the White House, is no longer affiliated with AFL.

McFadden ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, saying Thursday that two groups responsible for certain regulatory and administrative functions for the federal judiciary are an extension of the judicial branch, and therefore protected by the same exemptions to federal laws granted to the judiciary.

""Nothing about either entity’s structure suggests the president must supervise their employees or otherwise keep them ‘accountable,’ as is the case for executive officers,"" McFadden said.

TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS

The lawsuit by AFL was first reported by Fox News Digital earlier this year. It named both Chief Justice Roberts in his capacity as the official head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, and Robert J. Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and sought access to a trove of judicial documents from both bodies under the Freedom of Information Act.

AFL accused both groups of performing regulatory actions that the lawsuit argued exceeded the scope of the ""core functions"" of the judiciary, and which it argued should subject the groups to the FOIA requests as a result.

AFL cited recent actions the Judicial Conference and Administrative Office had taken in 2023 to ""accommodate"" requests from Congress to investigate allegations of ethical improprieties by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and subsequently to create or adopt an ""ethics code"" for justices on the high court.

""Under our constitutional tradition, accommodations with Congress are the province of the executive branch,"" AFL argued.

""The Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are therefore executive agencies,"" and must therefore be overseen by the president, not the courts, they said.

GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING

McFadden disagreed, rejecting the group’s argument that ""courts"" under FOIA refers only to judges. He concluded that both the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office are components of the judicial branch and therefore exempt from FOIA.

""Indeed, if America First were right that only judges and ‘law clerks,’ who ‘directly report to the judge,’ count as part of ‘the courts,’ numerous questions arise, and senseless line drawing ensues,"" he said in a memo opinion accompanying his order. ""Rather, FOIA’s exclusion reflects that courts include a full range of ‘judicial adjuncts,’ from ‘clerks’ to ‘court reporters,’ who perform ‘tasks that are an integral part of the judicial process.’""

Plaintiffs for AFL, led by attorney Will Scolinos, had argued in their lawsuit earlier this year that the Judicial Conference’s duties are ""executive functions"" and functions they allege must be supervised by executive officers ""who are appointed and accountable to other executive officers.""

Courts ""definitively do not create agencies to exercise functions beyond resolving cases or controversies or administratively supporting those functions,"" the group had argued.

The U.S. Judicial Conference is the national policymaking body for the courts. Overseen by the chief justice, it issues policy recommendations and reports to Congress as needed.

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

The Administrative Office for the U.S. Courts, meanwhile, operates under the guidance and supervision of the Judicial Conference. Its role is to provide administrative support to the federal courts on certain administrative issues and for day-to-day logistics, including setting budgets and organizing data, among other things.

The news comes as President Donald Trump, in his first year back in the White House, has relied heavily on executive orders to advance his agenda — a strategy that has accelerated implementation of campaign promises but also prompted a surge of legal challenges.

Noem said.

Two students were killed and nine others injured at Brown University on Dec. 13 when a man opened fire inside an engineering building. Two days later, Nuno Loureiro, 47, a professor of nuclear science and engineering, and of physics, was found shot dead at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 40 miles from Brown. The same gunman was responsible for the two incidents, authorities said.

The Diversity Immigrant Visa program, known as DV1, allows up to 50,000 people a year from countries with a low immigration rate to the U.S. to apply to come to the United States. The shooter, 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the U.S. in 2017 through that program, according to law enforcement authorities.

“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem said in a social media post that announced the decision.

At Trump’s direction, Noem said she ordered U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to immediately “pause” the program.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to questions about why Noem believed Valente should not have been admitted. His entry to the U.S. under that program occurred during Trump’s first term.

Trump unsuccessfully urged Congress to terminate the visa lottery in 2017 after another recipient, Sayfullo Saipov of Uzbekistan, carried out an Islamic State-inspired attack in Lower Manhattan that killed eight people and injured 18 others. Saipov was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

Authorities said they did not know what had motivated the gunman in the recent shootings at Brown University and Brookline. But Valente and Loureiro had attended the same academic program in Portugal, Leah Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts told reporters.

Valente was living in Miami before he came to Boston last month, authorities said.

The Trump administration has also sought to crack down on immigration following an attack in Washington, D.C., last month, in which an Afghan immigrant opened fire on two National Guard members, killing one and wounding the other. The administration paused immigration applications from 19 countries it deemed high risk, halted asylum cases processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and suspended all immigration-related requests from Afghan nationals, before further expanding its travel ban this week.

The suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, a Portuguese national, entered the country in 2017 through the diversity visa (DV) program, which makes up to 55,000 immigrant visas available worldwide through random selection, according to the State Department.

The program prioritizes those from countries with low immigration rates to the U.S. Applicants can then apply for a green card and are subject to the same standards as others seeking permanent residency.

“In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem wrote Thursday on the social platform X.

“At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program,” she added.

It’s unclear whether Trump has the power to suspend the visa lottery, which was established by Congress.

Immigration advocates blasted the move as unfairly punishing many based on the actions of one.

“It’s unjust to block the legal immigration processes of tens of thousands of people who have absolutely nothing to do with this offense, except that they happened to have applied for the same type of visa,” Myal Greene, president of World Relief, said in a statement.

“This is the latest instance of the administration leveraging an isolated evil action to advance its goal of dramatically reducing legal immigration. In doing so, it is circumventing Congress, harming our national economy and penalizing law-abiding individuals who have waited patiently abroad in one of the limited lines available to immigrate lawfully under the law.”

Valente was found dead inside a New Hampshire storage closet on Thursday, after authorities learned of his whereabouts through a person who came forward with information about the suspect.

The Saturday shooting at Brown University resulted in two deaths, just days before MIT professor Nuno F.G. Loureiro was shot and killed. The FBI previously said there was no link between the two cases.

Targeting the immigration pathway used by the shooter is the second such example in recent weeks of the Trump administration broadly restricting immigration in response to an incident.

An Afghan national was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a National Guard member last month in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration then placed a hold on all pending asylum applications and paused all pending immigration cases by foreign nationals from the 19 countries deemed “high risk” under Trump’s travel ban.

The president also took actions to limit immigration for Afghanistan specifically, halting the processing of any visas for the country, effectively ending the pathway for those who aided American war efforts there to the U.S.

In August, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would evaluate whether an applicant has “good moral character” and take a more “holistic” approach to asylum and citizenship applications.

USCIS said officers must now weigh not just any disqualifying behavior but whether those seeking a pathway to citizenship are in good standing in their community.

USCIS’ National Records Center maintains more than 55.6 million immigration records and has the largest federal FOIA program.
To compare, between Sept. 15 and Dec. 15, 2024, USCIS closed 5,427 FOIA requests due to individuals submitting inaccurate or incorrect information, according to the document.
While immigration policy has been a priority of the Trump administration due to mass deportations, the whistleblower disclosure shows that the FOIA issues at USCIS predate the current president.
“The imbalance caused by FOIA compliance failures creates a substantial and specific threat to public safety as processing delays result in unjust deportations, prolonged detention and family separation.”","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a Dec. 15 compliance report that it reduced its Freedom of Information Act request backlog for certain immigration records by 99.96% over the course of three months, an impressive feat given recent workforce cuts to agency FOIA teams and a 43-day government shutdown occurred during the period.

But a whistleblower disclosure sent to the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees on Friday argues that the agency has adopted unnecessarily strict criteria to summarily reject FOIA requests from migrants seeking documents for their immigration proceedings.

“The circumstances alongside the whistleblower’s disclosures suggest the reported reduction does not reflect timely, good-faith FOIA processing but rather mass closures of requests and other procedural mechanisms that remove requests from the pending inventory without reasonable searches or release of responsive records,” according to the document.

In 2020, a federal judge in Nightingale v. USCIS ordered the agency to meet statutory FOIA deadlines (generally 20-30 business days) for A-File immigration record requests, eliminate existing backlogs for such requests within 60 days and submit quarterly compliance reports.

USCIS’ National Records Center maintains more than 55.6 million immigration records and has the largest federal FOIA program.

In the disclosure submitted to Congress, which was handled by the Government Accountability Project nonprofit, an unnamed disabled Marine veteran who has worked in the agency’s FOIA office for more than a decade alleged that policies enacted over the past two years are intended to manufacture compliance with the Nightingale order.

Due to changes made in May, for example, the whistleblower said that migrants are receiving documents that are entirely redacted due to privacy and law enforcement reasons, even when it is information that the individual themselves provided to the government.

And in September, according to the disclosure, FOIA staff were ordered not to act on requests if the individual lists their attorney’s address instead of their own, which has been a common practice, or the requestor’s last name isn’t exactly the one USCIS has on file.

As a result, an individual who submitted a FOIA request about a month before their immigration court hearing on Nov. 24 did not receive their records because they provided non-requisite additional information that listed their parents’ maternal surnames, which USCIS did not have listed (e.g. Adam Lane Owen versus Adam Lane). This rejection occurred despite the A-File record numbers matching.

The whistleblower did say that the agency has begun informing individuals if their FOIA request is denied due to mismatched parents’ names, but they also pointed out that such notice is not helpful unless the requestor can successfully guess how their parents are listed in the agency’s records.

To compare, between Sept. 15 and Dec. 15, 2024, USCIS closed 5,427 FOIA requests due to individuals submitting inaccurate or incorrect information, according to the document. During the same period in 2025, there were 41,918 such rejections.

While immigration policy has been a priority of the Trump administration due to mass deportations, the whistleblower disclosure shows that the FOIA issues at USCIS predate the current president.

In fact, the first policy change mentioned in the disclosure occurred in March 2024 when FOIA officials apparently instructed employees to tell Cuban nationals who request certain documents that confirm their entry or admission to the U.S. that there’s no record, even though USCIS could possess that information.

“Without timely access to their records, individuals face a severe information imbalance. Government attorneys and immigration prosecutors have full access to the A-File while the noncitizen and their counsel remain in the dark,” according to the disclosure. “The imbalance caused by FOIA compliance failures creates a substantial and specific threat to public safety as processing delays result in unjust deportations, prolonged detention and family separation.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/19/121925_Getty_GovExec_USCIS/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:57:36.506241

DoJ racing to redact documents ahead of deadline to release Epstein files - report

Congress has mandated that the Trump administration release a trove of Epstein-related files by tomorrow – and the Justice Department is racing to process thousands of pages of documents and images.

In an exclusive, CNN reports that the Justice Department is racing to redact thousands of pages in oder to protect victims, and address executive and legal privacy concerns. Per CNN, counterintelligence specialists “ were asked to drop nearly all of their other work”.

Today, House Democrats released several dozen more photos from Epstein’s estate, which show his associations with the rich and famous, including images of Epstein cooking with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, an image of billionaire Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted. Another photo shows prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein.

Today's recap

House oversight Democrats released a new batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, in a last-ditch effort to pressure the DOJ to abide by tomorrow’s deadline to release its files related to the convicted sex offender. The images are undated and lack captions or context, and the appearance of people in the photos is not evidence of wrongdoing. Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body. There are also photographs of Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted, and of the prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein. Other images show Woody Allen, the director; Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser; and David Brooks, the author and New York Times opinion columnist, among others. The batch also includes photos of a number of foreign passports, with the information redacted, as well as Epstein’s US passport. There is also a screenshot of a text message conversation from a unknown sender referring to an 18-year-old from Russia. The sender says “I have a friend scout she sent me some girls today” then sends “But she asks 1000$ per girl”. Following messages read “I will send u girls now”, and “Maybe someone will be good for J?”.

Congressional Democrats expect that Trump’s Justice Department will comply with the deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday.“Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who’ve been working on this matter related to the full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,” Jeffries said, according to The Hill. “But if the Department of Justice does not comply with what is federal law at this point, there will be strong bipartisan pushback.”

In a statement after the release, Robert Garcia, a US representative and ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, said: “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DoJ must release the Epstein files now.”

Elsewhere, Robert F Kennedy Jr unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”. As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. The proposal would also prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to cover this type of care. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) together cover nearly half of all American children. More here.

New York Attorney General, Letitia James responded to the Trump administration’s new actions eliminating gender-affirming care for minors, addressing families in the state: “I know this latest proposal from this administration to cut access to gender affirming care for many youth is frightening,” she said in a video, posted to social media. “Whether you live in Brooklyn, Binghamton, Buffalo, or anywhere else in New York, and even if you don’t live in New York, I will not let this administration come for you, your doctors, or your lifesaving healthcare. As of now, nothing has changed.”

Trump also signed an executive order to move marijuana out of the most restrictive drug category, a change that would loosen limits on research and certain regulations but stop short of making marijuana legal nationwide. “I’m pleased to announce that I will be signing an Executive Order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance with legitimate medical uses,” the president said from the Oval Office. “This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” Trump added. “It’s going to have a tremendously positive impact.” The action allows for a pilot program that reimburses Medicare patients for products containing CBD, a widely used cannabis-derived compound that does not produce a high. Under the order, marijuana would be shifted from Schedule I, a category that includes heroin, to Schedule III, which also includes ketamine. The move, however, would not legalize marijuana as some states have done, and would not change how law enforcement agencies handle marijuana-related arrests, according to senior administration officials who spoke to the New York Times.

The Senate has confirmed 97 of Donald Trump’s executive and judicial nominations en bloc.

This comes after Senate Republicans changed chamber rules to allow for the bundled consideration executive nominees with a simple majority vote. Those confirmed today include state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce to be deputy US representative to the United Nation, and NY Republican congressman Anthony D’Esposito as Labor inspector general.

Brent Bozell III, who was US ambassador to South Africa, is the father of Brent Bozell IV, who was convicted of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Lawyers for Mark Kelly, the democratic senator of Arizona, have issued a letter asking defense secretary Pete Hegseth to clarify the nature of his investigation of Kelly.

On Monday, the Defense Department said it was elevating a “review” of Kelly’s involvement in a video he and other Democratic lawmakers made reminding service members it was their duty to disobey illegal orders. Kelly, a former naval officer, would be under an “official Command Investigation”, the department said.

Kelly’s lawyers issued a letter today, asking the secretary to clarify whther a command investigation had in fact commenced, who ordered the investigation, and under what authority, what allegations were under investigation, and on what basis the department of defense was claiming to assert jurisdiction over Kelly.

“The investigation appears to be premised entirely on accurate statements of law that the Senator made in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The First Amendment plainly protects those statements, just as it would protect similar statements by other retired servicemembers. In addition, a command investigation of a sitting Member of Congress who is not subject to military command authority would breach numerous constitutional and statutory safeguards,” the lawyers write.

Military law experts have said that although retired military officers can be recalled to active duty, Hegseth’s investigation into Kelly is an irregular use of of the military justice system. Democrats and some Republicans have also questioned the merits of the investigation.

In a joint statement, Democratic lawmakers and all ex-officio members of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees condemned Trump’s efforts to rename the Kennedy Center.

Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority. Federal law established the Center as a memorial to President Kennedy and prohibits changing its name without Congressional action. At today’s meeting, a sitting Member of Congress was muted, and participants were prevented from speaking—actions that reflect a troubling lack of transparency and respect for the rule of law. This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration, and as ex-officio members of the Kennedy Center Board, we will be unwavering in our commitment to holding this Administration accountable.”

The statement was signed by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island senator Mark Warner of Virginia, representative Rick Larsen of Washgington and representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio.

And most importantly, I want you to know that you’re not alone.”

While Donald Trump claimed during an address Wednesday that “inflation has stopped,” a rosy consumer price report released earlier today has prompted skepticism among economists.

Trump’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) saw an annual inflation rate of 2.7% last month--lower than the 3.1 percent economists had predicted, CNBC reported.

But the Bureau of Labor statistics did not collect data in October because of the government shutdown, leaving analysts wondering about how this affected interpretation of November’s data.

Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, reportedly said “the downside surprise reflects weakness in both goods and services, but may be partly due to methodological issues.”

“If these technical factors are the main source of weakness, we could see reacceleration in December,” CNBC quoted Gapen as saying.

Democrats expect DoJ to comply with Epstein files deadline, Jeffries says

Congressional Democrats expect that Trump’s Justice Department will comply with the deadline to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday.

“Based on my conversations with some of the top Democrats who’ve been working on this matter related to the full and complete disclosure of the Epstein files, we do expect compliance,” Jeffries said, according to The Hill. “But if the Department of Justice does not comply with what is federal law at this point, there will be strong bipartisan pushback.”

Congress passed a bill in November mandating that Trump’s Justice Department release investigative files within 30 days without redactions, with few exceptions such as victims’ names. Despite wavering on releasing the files, Trump signed the legislation into law on November 19--meaning the documents must be disclosed by Friday.

Victoria Bekiempis

In less than 48 hours, Donald Trump’s justice department must release most of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein in its possession.

Last month, Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.

Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group subsequently pledged to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.

It’s not clear what remedy could follow if the justice department does not heed the law mandating disclosure, though such a move would surely provoke a political firestorm. If the files are released, they could contain hundreds of thousands of pages related to investigations into the late sex trafficker, including additional victims’ claims and the names of his high-profile associates. The documents might also lift the veil on how Epstein – who counted Trump and the former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor among his powerful friends – evaded justice for decades.

Trump says he was 'surprised' by vote to add his name to Kennedy Center, move he previewed in August

Robert Mackey

When Donald Trump was asked today for his reaction to the news that the board of the Kennedy Center, whose members he appointed, had voted to add his name to the building, the president said “I was surprised by it”. But four months ago, at an 22 August Oval Office event, Trump announced that the World Cup draw would be taking place “at the Kennedy Center, some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so”.

Among the Democrats pointing out on Thursday that the board does not, in fact, have the power to change the name of the performing arts center, was Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman and a grandnephew of the man it is named for, John F. Kennedy.

“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” Joe Kennedy wrote on social media.

Republican representative Thomas Massie has posted this video on X this afternoon outlining what he says people can “expect in advance of tomorrow’s statutory disclosure deadline” for the attorney general to release the Epstein files.

The FBI 302 forms in the files will contain the names of “at least 20 men” implicated in sex crimes, sourced to victim lawyers, Massie says in the video. He goes on:

If we get a large production on December 19th and it does not contain a single name of any male who is accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven’t produced all the documents, it’s that simple.

House oversight Democrats released a new batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, in a last-ditch effort to pressure the DOJ to abide by tomorrow’s deadline to release its files related to the convicted sex offender. The images are undated and lack captions or context, and the appearance of people in the photos is not evidence of wrongdoing. Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body. There are also photographs of Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted, and of the prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein. Other images show Woody Allen, the director; Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser; and David Brooks, the author and New York Times opinion columnist, among others. The batch also includes photos of a number of foreign passports, with the information redacted, as well as Epstein’s US passport. There is also a screenshot of a text message conversation from a unknown sender referring to an 18-year-old from Russia. The sender says “I have a friend scout she sent me some girls today” then sends “But she asks 1000$ per girl”. Following messages read “I will send u girls now”, and “Maybe someone will be good for J?”.

In a statement after the release, Robert Garcia, a US representative and ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, said: “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DoJ must release the Epstein files now.”

Elsewhere, Robert F Kennedy Jr unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”. As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. The proposal would also prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to cover this type of care. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) together cover nearly half of all American children. More here.

Trump also signed an executive order to move marijuana out of the most restrictive drug category, a change that would loosen limits on research and certain regulations but stop short of making marijuana legal nationwide. “I’m pleased to announce that I will be signing an Executive Order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance with legitimate medical uses,” the president said from the Oval Office. “This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” Trump added. “It’s going to have a tremendously positive impact.” The action allows for a pilot program that reimburses Medicare patients for products containing CBD, a widely used cannabis-derived compound that does not produce a high. Under the order, marijuana would be shifted from Schedule I, a category that includes heroin, to Schedule III, which also includes ketamine. The move, however, would not legalize marijuana as some states have done, and would not change how law enforcement agencies handle marijuana-related arrests, according to senior administration officials who spoke to the New York Times.

Further on the next Fed chair, Trump said he could announce his pick “over the next couple of weeks”. He added he wasn’t sure it would be before the end of the year, but it would be “pretty soon”.

Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), stranding thousands of highly vetted refugees abroad.
“The Trump administration has been destroying America's lifesaving refugee program,” said Rep. Lofgren, a former immigration lawyer and senior member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration.
Refugee Admissions Program, we must remember that the Trump administration’s restrictive policies—though agonizing and dehumanizing—do not represent who we are as a people.","WASHINGTON, DC - Representative Zoe Lofgren (CA-18) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) today, on International Migrants Day, reintroduced the Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement (GRACE) Act, legislation that would ensure a U.S. President cannot set a Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions—the annual refugee admissions goal—below 125,000 refugees. As the Trump administration’s ramps up its racist and xenophobic attacks on refugees, this legislation would seek to reestablish the United States’ commitment to welcoming refugees. Protecting those fleeing persecution is a fundamental American value. The GRACE Act takes a necessary step toward upholding this value.

Upon taking office earlier this year, President Trump signed an Executive Order suspending the entry of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), stranding thousands of highly vetted refugees abroad. In October, the Trump administration announced that it would set the Fiscal Year 2026 refugee admissions cap at 7,500 refugees—the lowest ceiling in the history of the refugee program since Congress established the program in 1980. President Trump has destroyed the USRAP’s historic mission and eroded the United States’ moral standing in the world.

“The Trump administration has been destroying America's lifesaving refugee program,” said Rep. Lofgren, a former immigration lawyer and senior member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. “Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is a betrayal of American values, and it comes at a time when refugee numbers are increasing significantly due to instability around the globe. The GRACE Act upholds our country's commitments and grants safety and opportunity to those whose lives have been uprooted, many of whom are children.”

“The Trump administration’s racist and xenophobic attacks on refugees have made it more critical to recommit our country to its promises of safety for those seeking refuge. The GRACE Actreaffirms a simple truth: the United States is strongest when we lead with our values,” said Senator Markey. “As a country founded by immigrants fleeing religious persecution, the United States has always been a guiding light for those walking in the darkest tunnels. We must recommit to this fundamental American principle and embrace those who fear persecution abroad.”

The GRACE Act is cosponsored by Representatives Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09), Danny Davis (IL-07), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Henry C. (“Hank”) Johnson, Jr. (GA-04), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Ted Lieu (CA-36), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), and Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), and Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

The GRACE Act would prevent U.S. Presidents from gutting the USRAP. Specifically, the GRACE Act would:

Automatically set the annual level of refugee admissions at 125,000 if the President fails to issue a determination before the beginning of each fiscal year;

Ensure that each officer responsible for refugee admissions or resettlement treats the presidential determination as a goal;

Encourage the President to consider the report of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) on global resettlement needs when setting the presidential determination and determining regional allocations; and

Mandate quarterly reports to Congress with specific oversight requirements.

Several refugee advocates and stakeholder organizations expressed their support for the GRACE Act.

“The reintroduction of the GRACE Act is a necessary step toward restoring accountability, humanity, and the rule of law to the U.S. refugee resettlement program,” said John Slocum, Executive Director of Refugee Council USA. “At every turn, the Trump administration has betrayed our nation’s promise as a beacon of refuge for the persecuted, dismantling America’s ability to respond to global humanitarian crises, and discriminating against refugees who are most at risk and left stranded abroad. The GRACE Act would set a minimum refugee admissions goal that no administration could go below – and strengthen Congress’s oversight role to hold this administration - and future administrations - accountable to operate the refugee program in good faith. This legislation reaffirms a simple but essential truth: welcoming refugees is not optional; it is a legal and humanitarian obligation as much as it is a reflection of who we are as a nation.”

“In a tumultuous year for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, we must remember that the Trump administration’s restrictive policies—though agonizing and dehumanizing—do not represent who we are as a people. Today’s reintroduction of the GRACE Act is a vital step towards accountability, the restoration of a compassionate resettlement program that responds to global needs, and stronger protections against future attacks,” said Erol Kekic, Chief Strategy Officer at Church World Service. “The GRACE Act would establish essential safeguards, including a minimum annual refugee admissions target, to ensure presidents cannot undermine the refugee program and abandon our commitment to welcome. Its passage would help return the U.S. role on the international stage to one of leadership, not xenophobia. We thank Senator Markey and Representative Lofgren for their leadership in reintroducing the GRACE Act and urge their colleagues in Congress to support its passage.”

“The International Rescue Committee is grateful to Sen. Markey and Rep. Lofgren for their continued leadership to ensure that America’s resettlement goals reflect global humanitarian needs generated by historic levels of displacement,” said Hans Van de Weerd, Senior Vice President of Resettlement, Asylum and Integration, International Rescue Committee. “The re-introduction of the GRACE Act comes at a pivotal moment with over 117 million forcibly displaced people and 36 million refugees worldwide. It is more important than ever to re-affirm America’s longstanding bipartisan commitment to a resettlement program that protects the world’s most vulnerable refugees regardless of their country of origin.”

“At this time of global displacement and unprecedented resettlement needs, we are deeply grateful for Senator Markey and Congresswoman Lofgren and all cosponsors’ leadership in reintroducing the GRACE Act. This legislation is more needed than ever to ensure that the United States lives up to its promise of being a safe haven to those in dire need of protection. We know that as a country we can, and more importantly, we must, meet the essential standards set in this legislation to once again lead on the world stage in providing safety to refugees in need of resettlement,” said Robyn Barnard, Senior Director of Refugee and Immigrant Rights at Human Rights First.

“Refugees aren’t just fleeing persecution, torture and inhumane treatment, they are a lifeblood of the United States economy and help make America a more free, safe and secure nation. Senator Markey’s GRACE Act will ensure no President can put partisan politics over human rights and our national interests by recommitting America to its tradition of welcoming refugees through a rational, predictable and democratic process. We commend the Senator and his co-sponsors for authoring this important legislation and hope Congress acts on it swiftly,” said Elizabeth Sweet, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy (MIRA) Coalition.

The GRACE Act is endorsed by Refugee Council USA, Church World Service, Human Rights First, National Partnership for New Americans, Advocates for Human Rights, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Refugee Congress, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, African Human Rights Coalition, Witness at the Border, Sojourners, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, MIRA Coalition, Climate Refugees, Refugees International, AfghanEvac, HIAS, the Workers Circle, Refugee Advocacy Lab, Friends Committee on National Legislation, International Refugee Assistance Project, International Institute of New England, Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, National Immigration Law Center, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, American Humanist Association, International Rescue Committee, Coalition on Human Needs, Catholic Charities of Boston, Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts, Ascentria Care Alliance, Amnesty International USA, American Civil Liberties Union, SIREN, and United Stateless.

,Agencies,2025-12-19 15:00:34+00:00,the Guardian,Revealed: FBI opened domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity across US,"Sam Levin, www.theguardian.com, sam-levin",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/fbi-terrorism-investigations-anti-ice-activity,"The FBI has launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 regions across the US, according to an internal report shared with the Guardian.
The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” memo issued by Donald Trump in September.
The FBI document, disseminated to other law enforcement agencies, warns of increased “threat activity targeting government personnel or facilities related to immigration enforcement efforts”.
The other cases involve domestic terrorism, conspiracy to impede or injure officers, civil unrest, anti-riot laws, destruction of vehicles, and “bombing matters”.
He also noted that since 9/11, the FBI has had wide latitude to launch terrorism investigations based on minimal evidence and with little oversight.","The FBI has launched “criminal and domestic terrorism investigations” into “threats against immigration enforcement activity” in at least 23 regions across the US, according to an internal report shared with the Guardian.

The two-page FBI document, dated 14 November, says some of the investigations are related to the “countering domestic terrorism” memo issued by Donald Trump in September.

Released after the killing of Charlie Kirk, Trump’s memo, known as NSPM-7, called for a “national strategy” to thwart “violent and terroristic activities” associated with “anti-fascism”. It described “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism and anti-Christianity” as threats and cited “riots” in Los Angeles and Portland, referring to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as examples of “political violence”.

The FBI document, disseminated to other law enforcement agencies, warns of increased “threat activity targeting government personnel or facilities related to immigration enforcement efforts”. It points to two violent attacks against ICE facilities in Texas, but says “domestic terrorist subjects”, who fall under NSPM-7, have also engaged in “reactive violent attacks which took advantage of First Amendment-protected activities nationwide”.

“[Domestic terrorist] attacks against ICE continue to be perpetrated primarily by individuals or small groups of actors,” the report continued, asserting that recent incidents marked “an escalation in violence compared to past attacks, which primarily resulted in property damage”.

The document says “indicators” that an individual may be planning to attack ICE include “stockpiling or distributing firearms”, but also “conducting online research” about agents’ movements and using encrypted messaging apps.

The FBI report was republished by another law enforcement entity and disclosed in documents obtained through public records requests by Property of the People, a government transparency non-profit.

Civil rights groups have raised concerns that NSPM-7 would be used to crack down on leftist organizing, ICE protesters and Trump critics, and advocates who reviewed the FBI’s November report for the Guardian said it renewed their fears.

“[The FBI document] is infused with vague and overbroad language, which was exactly our concern about NSPM-7 in the first place. It invites law enforcement suspicion and investigation based on purely first amendment-protected beliefs and activities,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project. “People who are entirely innocent of any wrongdoing can be subjected to surveillance or investigation. That imposes stigma. It can wrongly immesh people in the criminal legal system.”

The FBI declined to comment.

The FBI “public safety awareness” report warned that “criminal actors with varying social and political goals” were increasingly threatening ICE, but it did not detail specific investigations or threats.

The report said cases involving “assault on a federal officer” are the most common in the FBI’s investigations into anti-ICE activity. The other cases involve domestic terrorism, conspiracy to impede or injure officers, civil unrest, anti-riot laws, destruction of vehicles, and “bombing matters”.

The FBI document referenced two concrete incidents of past violence. In July, a group of people allegedly threw fireworks and vandalized vehicles at an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas, before one of them allegedly shot a local police officer. Some defendants in the case have since pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges while others’ cases are ongoing, and a Guardian investigation has raised questions about the government’s larger narratives about the events.

In September, a gunman fired at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two ICE detainees before fatally shooting himself. No ICE staff were injured. Some prominent Republicans blamed that shooting on “the left”, but the shooter’s motives and politics were not clear, and there was no evidence the suspect was tied to any political organizing or activist groups.

The FBI’s report included a map spotlighting FBI offices across the country with ongoing investigations. As of 31 October, the FBI said it had opened criminal and domestic terrorism investigations into “observed threats” against ICE activity across 23 of its field offices, spanning most regions of the country, including Washington state, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Kansas, Georgia, Illinois, Florida, New York and Maine. It’s unclear how many total investigations the bureau has launched, with the report noting that in the regions of Chicago, Dallas and Portland, Oregon, there have been more than 10 “incidents” each.

Separately, the FBI’s map also listed 27 locations where there are ongoing domestic terrorism investigations that fall under NSPM-7, though the report does not specify if all of those cases are related to anti-ICE threats. The FBI did not respond to inquiries seeking clarification. The report also noted some NSPM-7 cases pre-dated the president’s memo, but were aligned with its goals.

There are more than 30 states total where the FBI has opened cases tied to anti-ICE activity or NSPM-7, the map shows.

“These areas could see increased threat activity in the near term,” the FBI warned, without providing evidence or specifics.

The report continued: “Indicators that individuals may be planning an attack against ICE … may include conducting surveillance; conducting online research regarding when ICE personnel may be arriving at or departing from a facility or operation; stockpiling or distributing firearms with an intent to conduct an attack or discussing operational plans with other like-minded individuals via encrypted communication applications.”

Civil liberties advocates said the “indicators” language was troubling.

“It is not illegal to do online research about the publicly available movements of government officers or to communicate through encrypted apps like Signal or WhatsApp,” said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit, in an email. “While the document refers to using encrypted communications to ‘discuss operational planning’, that term is undefined and ambiguous, leaving it open what kinds of conversations might draw FBI scrutiny.”

The FBI has recently faced criticisms over its surveillance of activists opposing ICE activities. Records obtained by Property of the People and shared with the Guardian last month revealed that the FBI spied on a private Signal group chat of volunteers organizing “courtwatch” efforts, characterizing the activists who monitor public proceedings in immigration courtrooms as “anarchist violent extremists”.

The FBI’s November report builds on assertions by the Trump administration of a dramatic rise in attacks on immigration enforcement agents. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeatedly asserted that there has been a “1,000% increase” in assaults on ICE officers, a claim written into NSPM-7. But the DHS has not provided evidence to support the claim.

A recent Los Angeles Times investigation, based on thousands of pages of court records involving assault cases prosecuted in southern California, Portland, Chicago and Washington DC, found the majority of alleged attacks resulted in no injury to an agent. Law enforcement files reviewed by the Guardian in July revealed that US immigration officers had made false and misleading statements about several Los Angeles protesters they arrested during mass demonstrations and had accused of violence. Several high-profile federal prosecutions for alleged assaults against immigration officers have ended in dismissals or not guilty verdicts.

The FBI report further noted that NSPM-7 called for the investigation of “institutional and individual funders, and officers and employees of organizations, that are responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet” criminal conduct, part of the memo that has raised strong concerns about the federal government targeting civil society and nonprofit groups.

The FBI’s report said it was building on an intelligence bulletin it issued in October, also obtained by Property of the People, about “domestic violent extremists” threatening ICE. That bulletin included a footnote stating, “The mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected.”

Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People, said the FBI’s November report was particularly alarming when considered alongside a US attorney general’s office 4 December memo on NSPM-7 implementation.

The memo to federal prosecutors said “criminal conduct rising to the level of domestic terrorism” includes “doxing of law enforcement, mass rioting and destruction … violent efforts to shut down immigration enforcement [and] targeting of public officials”. It cited “opposition to … immigration enforcement” … and “extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders” as potential terrorist ideologies.

The attorney general called for a wide range of prosecutions, including “picketing or parading with intent to obstruct the administration of justice” and “obstruction or disruption in or on federal property”. It also directed federal law enforcement agencies to share “Antifa” files with the FBI.

Trump has branded “antifa” a terrorist organization, despite the fact that there is no formal “antifa” entity, with the term frequently used by conservatives to describe a wide range of anti-fascist, leftist and liberal activism.

“At its core, the war on antifa is a war on dissent, a war on free speech,” Shapiro said in a statement. He argued the FBI and attorney general memos, along with Trump’s repeated disparaging of protesters and opponents, “strongly suggest that one of the primary functions of NSPM-7 is to serve as a vehicle for targeting anti-ICE organizing broadly as an anarchist violent extremist threat”.

The records, Shapiro added, suggest “the ultimate intended use of NSPM-7 is as an instrument for classifying criticism of the Trump regime as extremism and terrorism”.

Spokespeople for ICE and DHS did not respond to inquiries.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email that NSPM-7 is “focused on investigating, disrupting, dismantling, and prosecuting individuals and entities engaged in organized political violence and domestic terrorism – specifically the sophisticated and organized campaigns that necessitate a new law enforcement strategy”.

Jackson accused “leftwing organizations” of fueling “violent riots”, organizing “attacks against law enforcement officers” and carrying out other crimes. “The Trump administration will get to the bottom of this vast network inciting violence in American communities, and the president’s executive actions to address leftwing violence will put an end to any illegal activities.”

A DoJ spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the attorney general’s memo, saying in a statement: “Political violence has no place in this country, and this Department of Justice will investigate, identify, and root out any individual or violent extremist group attempting to commit or promote this heinous activity.”

In response to questions about federal assault prosecutions ending in acquittals and dismissals, the spokesperson said: “The Department of Justice will continue to seek the most serious available charges against any individual who puts federal agents in harm’s way … We will never make charging decisions based on the opinions of self-proclaimed ‘experts’.”

Mike German, a former FBI agent, who is now a civil liberties advocate, said NSPM-7 was a “chilling document that likens political opposition to government policy to terrorism”. He also noted that since 9/11, the FBI has had wide latitude to launch terrorism investigations based on minimal evidence and with little oversight.

“All it takes is an allegation to justify opening a preliminary investigation, and agents can make their own allegations, so the number of investigations doesn’t really tell you very much other than the FBI is taking this mandate from NSPM-7 to open a wide range of cases,” he said.

These kinds of FBI alerts with broad and vague language are unhelpful to other law enforcement officials, German added: “It doesn’t give a lot of specific information about what law enforcement should be looking for or how to differentiate between a protester and somebody who might be presenting some kind of violent threat. It just tends to raise the fear level in law enforcement.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a013038f680b595c81fd11efca424a31e7f711/479_0_6139_4912/master/6139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f258b88291f435cdc574f16bac92d0e6",N,,2025-12-19 10:57:41.786103

For example, the National Association of Counties advised its members on June 20, 2024:

“On June 18 [2024] Congress took a significant step in supporting local fire departments across the nation by passing the Fire Grants and Safety Act (S. 870). Pending President Biden’s signature, final passage ensures the continuation and enhancement of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant programs. These crucial programs, facing a statutory termination date of September 30, 2024, have now been extended to September 30, 2030…. For counties, the reauthorization of these grants is crucial. Without AFG and SAFER, local fire departments would lose approximately $700 million annually in federal assistance, which is indispensable for maintaining the safety and readiness of local fire services and the protection and well-being of county residents.” https://www.naco.org/news/congress-reauthorizes-critical-safer-and-afg-grants-until-2030

What Emergency Management Professionals Need to Know

The Contested DEI Certification Requirements

Based on two Presidential Executive Orders issued on January 20 and January 21, 2025, FEMA and other DHS agencies added new standard terms and conditions requiring all grant recipients to certify that:

(i) They do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws; and

(ii) They do not engage in and will not during the term of this award engage in, a discriminatory prohibited boycott.

Grant Programs Subject to Both Injunctions

FEMA Emergency Management Performance Grant Program

FEMA Homeland Security Grant Program

FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program

FEMA Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant Program

FEMA Fire Prevention and Safety Grants

FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program

FEMA Port Security Grant Program

FEMA Transit Security Grant Program

Chicago Injunction: U.S. District Court for Northern District of Illinois

Legal Background

On November 21, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge Manish S. Shah granted a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the cities of Chicago, Boston, New York, Baltimore, Minneapolis, New Haven, Connecticut, and Ramsey County, Minnesota.

Court’s Key Findings

Judge Shah acknowledged plaintiffs’ substantial concerns about the government’s unilateral interpretation of “illegal DEI.” The court wrote: “Plaintiffs make much of their fear that the government will unilaterally use its understanding of ‘illegal DEI’ to withhold money, or worse, penalize plaintiffs with False Claims Act lawsuits threatening treble damages…. The preliminary injunction does not order the payment of money that the government might not be able to recoup; it only limits the conditions DHS can impose on a grant.”

This reasoning highlights a critical concern: the risk of retroactive enforcement actions based on the government’s evolving interpretation of prohibited “DEI” activities, potentially exposing agencies to triple damages under the False Claims Act.

California Injunction: U.S. District Court for Northern District of California

Legal Background

Also on November 21, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Orrick issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by San Francisco, numerous other California municipalities, and the City of Tucson, Arizona.

Court’s Rationale

Judge Orrick’s decision emphasized that the contested provisions fundamentally redefine long-established federal anti-discrimination standards. The court noted: “Plaintiffs have agreed to comply with federal antidiscrimination laws as a condition to their funding in the past. But they assert that ‘the federal government has now called the meaning of those laws in question by purporting to interpret them far differently than previously understood by Congress, the executive, or the courts – leaving it unclear what is expected under the terms.'”

The court found this ambiguity unacceptable and that “the balance of the equities and public interest favor granting plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.”

Scope of Relief Granted

Judge Orrick’s order specifically enjoins defendants and their agents from “directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition funds from the plaintiffs based on (1) Section C.XVII of the Standard DHS Terms (the ‘Discrimination Condition’); and (2) Section C.XXXI of the Standard DHS Terms (the ‘EO Condition’).”

Legal Support and Advocacy

According to court filings, the Public Rights Project, an Oakland, California-based organization, provided litigation support in both successful cases. The organization helps local government officials work with communities to protect and expand civil rights through litigation support, legal representation, and training.

Related Litigation

BRIC Program Protection (August 2025; December 2025)

On August 5, 2025, U.S. District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns of the District of Massachusetts issued an injunction prohibiting FEMA from terminating the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) pre-disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit was brought by 18 states and the order prevents FEMA “from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court is able to render a final judgment on the merits.”

Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 BRIC projects to receive roughly $4.5 billion in funding nationwide. The program funds critical projects like constructing levees and floodwalls and generating backup electricity for hospitals and school districts during emergencies.

On December 11, 2025, Judge Stearns granted summary judgment to the states, holding: “In sum, this is not a case about judicial encroachment on the discretionary authority of the Executive Branch. This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that.” The Court in its Order wrote: “The court vacates and sets aside the termination of the BRIC program pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).”

Fourth Circuit Stays Nationwide DEI Injunction (March 2025)

On March 14, 2025, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the government’s request to stay a nationwide preliminary injunction that had been issued by a Maryland district court. This means the broad nationwide protections from that case are currently not in effect, though the Chicago and California injunctions remain active in their respective jurisdictions.

The Maryland case was brought by the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, the American Association of University Professors, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, and the City of Baltimore. U.S. District Court Judge Adam B. Abelson had issued a preliminary injunction on February 21, 2025, prohibiting federal agencies from pausing, freezing, or terminating awards based on the DEI Executive Orders.

Practical Implications for Grant Recipients

Immediate Actions for State and Local Agencies

Consult Legal Counsel: Before accepting any FEMA or DHS grants containing DEI certification requirements, agencies should consult with their legal counsel to understand jurisdiction-specific protections and potential risks.

Understand Geographic Scope: The Chicago and California injunctions provide clear protection to plaintiffs in those cases. Agencies in other jurisdictions should determine whether similar protections apply to them.

False Claims Act Risk: The preliminary injunctions do not prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from launching investigations for false certifications under the False Claims Act or other statutes. Agencies must carefully consider certification requirements in light of this continuing risk.

Document Internal Policies: Agencies should maintain clear documentation of their programs and policies to demonstrate compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws as traditionally understood.

Current Legal Status

It is critical to understand that preliminary injunctions represent temporary relief pending full resolution of the underlying cases. These orders can be stayed or overturned on appeal (as occurred with the Maryland nationwide injunction), modified as litigation proceeds, or dissolved if circumstances change.

The Public Rights Project has confirmed that the U.S. Government has not filed appeals in either case as of December 10, 2025.

Grant recipients should not assume these protections are permanent and should continue monitoring legal developments closely.

Congressional Intent for Fire Service Grants

The contested DEI provisions particularly affect firefighter assistance programs, which have strong bipartisan congressional support. When Congress reauthorized the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) and SAFER grant programs through fiscal year 2028 on July 9, 2024, the Congressional Fire Services Institute reflected on the program’s origins 25 years ago.

The Congressional Fire Services Caucus fought for two years to establish federal support for local fire departments, “affirming that the nation’s safety demands federal investment in the fire service.” President Bill Clinton signed the FIRE Act into law on October 30, 2000. This history underscores that fire service grants were created to support local fire departments in their life-saving mission, not to serve as vehicles for implementing executive branch policy initiatives unrelated to fire safety and emergency response.

Connection to Immigration-Related Grant Litigation

In September 2025, federal courts blocked similar attempts to condition the same homeland security grants on immigration enforcement cooperation. The legal principles established in those cases – requirements for clear standards, avoidance of unconstitutional coercion, and consistent agency action – appear to be influencing courts’ approach to DEI-related conditions.

Both sets of cases reflect a consistent judicial concern: emergency preparedness funding authorized by Congress for specific public safety purposes should not be converted into a mechanism for implementing unrelated executive branch policy initiatives without clear congressional authorization.

Broader Context: Grant Administration and Separation of Powers

These DEI-related cases raise important questions about the extent of executive branch authority to impose policy conditions on congressionally authorized grant programs:

Can the executive branch unilaterally reinterpret federal anti-discrimination statutes in ways that substantially depart from decades of precedent?

May the executive impose certification requirements so vague that grant recipients cannot determine compliance?

Should emergency preparedness funding be conditioned on compliance with Executive Orders addressing domestic policy matters beyond the scope of the authorizing legislation?

When funding conditions are unclear enough that recipients face potential False Claims Act liability for good-faith mistakes, do such conditions violate due process?

Federal courts are now weighing these questions, with outcomes that will shape grant administration across the federal government for years to come.

Conclusion

State and local communities should be able to access congressionally authorized FEMA and DHS grants without fear of retroactive enforcement actions based on ambiguous certification requirements. Congress created these grant programs – from firefighter assistance to emergency management performance grants to pre-disaster mitigation – for the benefit of all communities.

The preliminary injunctions issued in Chicago and California provide important immediate protections, but the ultimate resolution of these disputes remains uncertain. As litigation continues, emergency management professionals, fire departments, and other grant recipients must carefully navigate an uncertain legal landscape while continuing their essential missions of protecting communities and saving lives.

Regardless of one’s views on DEI policies, there is broad consensus that emergency preparedness funding should flow based on demonstrated need, capability gaps, and statutory criteria, not as leverage for implementing policy objectives unrelated to the core mission of protecting Americans from disasters and emergencies.

According to Hashemi, the decision to leave Afghanistan was personal and was not facilitated by any specific individual or institution.

Investigations by Afghanistan International show that over the past four years the Taliban have been involved in more than 150 clashes with Pakistani border forces.
Data compiled by Afghanistan International show that over the past 10 days, the Taliban have flogged at least 70 people nationwide, including nine women.","Hashemi’s family reported in June that she had gone missing. Her husband, Sayed Mohsen Hashemi, told Afghanistan International at the time that she had left home to visit friends and had not returned, adding that her phones were switched off. He later stopped commenting publicly on her situation.

On Wednesday, Hashemi contacted singer and women’s rights activist Ariana Saeed and informed her that she had left the country. According to Hashemi, the decision to leave Afghanistan was personal and was not facilitated by any specific individual or institution.

She did not refer to her reported disappearance and declined to provide details about her circumstances while in Afghanistan.

In an interview with the BBC, Hashemi said she had faced many difficulties over the past six years and had been waiting for an opportunity to leave the country so she could “raise her voice.” She did not elaborate further.

Previously, Ariana Saeed said in a video message that Hashemi had fled her home because of domestic violence and said her husband had spread false information to the media by claiming she had been abducted. Saeed alleged that Hashemi’s husband was attempting to trace her whereabouts through media reports and social media.

Following reports of Hashemi’s disappearance, Taliban officials said they had detained several of her relatives.

Hashemi rose to prominence after reaching the final round of the Afghan Star singing competition, broadcast by the private Tolo TV, where she competed against dozens of male singers.

Dobrindt said the transfer process has been accelerated amid the risk that the refugees could be deported from Pakistan. He told German media that many Afghans with German admission pledges are living in uncertainty and that the government is seeking to complete case reviews and relocate as many as possible before the end of the month.

He added that a small number would likely remain, and their cases would be reviewed next year.

Some of the refugees previously worked with the German government or German organisations in Afghanistan, while others are considered at risk, including journalists and human rights activists.

Pakistan, which has deported millions of Afghans over the past year, has urged Western countries, including Germany, to relocate refugees who have already received admission pledges. Dobrindt said Berlin is in talks with Pakistani authorities regarding deadlines for deportations.

Germany’s new government has not accepted all Afghans awaiting relocation in Pakistan. German media reported last week that the conservative government led by Friedrich Merz rejected 650 Afghans who had previously received admission pledges.

The Merz government had earlier sought to discourage dozens of Afghans with admission pledges in Pakistan from travelling to Germany by offering financial incentives, but only about 60 people reportedly accepted the offer.

Najibullah Shaheen, the acting head of the Taliban embassy in Norway, said the first batch of newly issued passports has already been distributed to applicants.

Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on March 21 that it had accepted Shaheen, a Taliban diplomat, as first secretary at the Afghan embassy in Oslo. The ministry said it issued him a one-year diplomatic residence card.

Shortly after assuming his post, Shaheen changed the embassy’s signage from “Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan” to “Embassy of Afghanistan.”

After the collapse of Afghanistan’s previous government and the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, passport issuance was suspended at most Afghan diplomatic and consular missions abroad.

In recent months, several Afghan missions under Taliban control have resumed issuing passports, including embassies in Islamabad, Tehran and New Delhi, as well as a number of consulates in Germany and other countries.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the Taliban Ministry of Defence said Fitrat met with media representatives, political analysts and a number of Taliban officials to discuss coordination and strengthen cooperation.

At the meeting, Fitrat said Taliban forces had shown “no hesitation whatsoever” over the past four years in defending and protecting Afghanistan. He said the Taliban army is standing on its own feet and working to modernise its capabilities.

“We are striving to build an army equipped with modern weapons to defend the country’s territory under any circumstances,” Fitrat said. “Our army has proven to the people that anyone who looks at this land with ill intent will face a firm and courageous response, and it has also been proven to neighbouring countries that any aggression against Afghanistan will be met with a several-fold response.”

Fitrat did not name any specific country.

After the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, large quantities of advanced US military equipment were left behind and later taken over by the Taliban. The US Department of Defense has estimated the value of this equipment at more than $7 billion, including military vehicles, advanced weapons, biometric devices and other matériel.

Investigations by Afghanistan International show that over the past four years the Taliban have been involved in more than 150 clashes with Pakistani border forces. The Taliban have also clashed on several occasions with Iranian border guards.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the court said the Kabul primary counter-narcotics court sentenced the individuals to between 10 and 39 lashes and prison terms ranging from seven months to three years. The charges included selling and trafficking tablet K, methamphetamine, hashish and alcoholic beverages.

Data compiled by Afghanistan International show that over the past 10 days, the Taliban have flogged at least 70 people nationwide, including nine women.

According to a United Nations report presented to the Security Council last week, the Taliban flogged at least 215 people, 44 women and 171 men, across various provinces during the three-month period from August 1 to October 31.

Despite repeated criticism from international organisations over the use of corporal punishment and the treatment of detainees, the Taliban have continued to carry out public floggings across Afghanistan.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/3a994afe4280bb70d062ebd80c491ac930a32ce1-1600x1069.jpg?rect=51,282,1499,787&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-19 11:58:34.816372

See below for a full list of fiscal year 2025-2026 CBP and ICE contracts for companies based in Louisiana.","U.S. Border Patrol's high-profile immigration crackdowns in North Carolina and Louisiana over the last two months have brought fresh scrutiny to the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on immigration raids and arrests under the Trump administration.

The massive spending bill pushed by Trump and passed by Congress this summer increased immigration enforcement by $170 billion, part of a broader push to reach the administration's goal of deporting 1 million immigrants each year.

The new round of immigration spending includes $75 billion over four years for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on top of the $10 billion the agency had already been allocated for 2025. The bill also gave $65 billion more to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), which had already received $20 billion for fiscal year 2025.

While CBP and ICE, which both operate under the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for immigration matters, Border Patrol has emerged as the leader in Trump's anti-immigration crusade in recent months, according to immigration reporter Nick Miroff of The Atlantic. Under the bombastic leadership of Gregory Bovino, who grew up in western North Carolina, CBP has led a series of high-profile and militarized operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and New Orleans that have sparked widespread backlash due to their heavy-handed tactics and violations of due process.

Helping carry out Border Patrol and ICE's immigration operations are an army of private contractors who have seen their fortunes soar as federal money has flowed into enforcement activities.

In the wake of the major operations in Louisiana and North Carolina, Facing South and the Institute for Southern Studies collected and analyzed data from USASpending.gov on more than 50 businesses headquartered in those states who are receiving CBP and ICE contracts for fiscal years 2025-2026. The contracts for companies based in Louisiana and North Carolina total more than $341 million.

NORTH CAROLINA

The Facing South/Institute analysis finds 38 companies based in North Carolina receiving contracts from CBP and ICE. These contracts are currently valued at $61.7 million, with a potential to grow to $77.9 million once the work is completed.

One of the most notable contractors is Quantico Tactical, founded and owned by former Marine David Hensley. Based in Aberdeen, N.C., Quantico has received more than 50 contracts valued up to $19.3 million for fiscal years 2025-2026 providing a wide range of firearms, ""less than lethal"" munitions, restraints, communications equipment, and other supplies to both Border Patrol and ICE.

Other top contractors include Laboratory Corporation of America (Labcorp) in Burlington, N.C., which has contracts potentially valued up to $21.4 million for laboratory services, including at ICE detention centers, and TMC-TELESOLV of Battleboro, N.C., which has a contract valued up to $14.8 million for CBP's Trusted Traveler Program.

Duncan-Parnell, Inc., in Charlotte has a $5 million CBP contract for drones, and MacGyver Solutions, Inc. has contracts valued up to $2.2 million for Polaris and Yamaha vehicles and ATVs.

In August, Hendrick Motorsports Technical Solutions of Concord, N.C. was given a $1.5 million no-bid contract to supply 25 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles to ICE. The company is a spinoff of Hendrick Motorsports; both are owned by Rick Hendrick, a prominent Republican donor. Media attention about the deal during the North Carolina immigration raids led to calls to boycott Hendrick's companies, which include car dealerships in the state.

LOUISIANA

In Louisiana, where Border Patrol's ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" is still underway, there are fewer contractors, but the total awards to companies based in the state is much larger.

Facing South/Institute analysis of contracting data finds 16 Louisiana-based companies receiving contracts from CBP and ICE in fiscal years 2025-2026. The current value of those awards is $50.3 million, but the total potential value is listed at $263.2 million for the state.

Topping the list are two companies which stand to bring in more than $208 million making emergency detention centers for ICE. LaSalle Corrections, which manages 18 private correctional facilities in Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, received a contract worth up to $125 million to build a new detention center. The company has a checkered history: In 2023, LaSalle agreed to a $7 million settlement over a wrongful death lawsuit, and the ACLU of Louisiana has frequently battled with the company over forced hysterectomies of ICE detainees and other alleged rights abuses.

Lemoine Disaster Recovery, LLC — a building and disaster services company headquartered in Lafayette, L.A. — was awarded a contract worth up to $83.8 million, also to build an emergency ICE detention facility.

Another major contract went to People Who Think, LLC — a marketing and political consulting firm founded by Republican political advisor Jay Connaughton. The firm's $25 million contract is earmarked for an ICE recruitment campaign. Gulf South Research Group, based in Baton Rouge, pulled in several contracts totaling $21.6 million for environmental assessments and planning, including projects related to the border wall.

Trump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery.
He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil.","President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump's direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.

""This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,"" she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.

Neves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

Neves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.

The diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.

Nearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.

Lottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.

Trump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem's announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump's administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.

While pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil.

But Trump exaggerated the average price now.
In a May press conference on drug prices, Trump made comparisons similar to his 400% to 600% price-drop claims.","President Donald Trump blitzed through a prime-time address to the nation on Dec. 17, but while short, Trump’s speech contained a number of inaccurate or misleading claims, many of which he has repeated in public speeches for months.

Trump mentioned several items, such as cars and plane tickets, that he said experienced price increases under former President Joe Biden and price decreases during Trump’s own presidency. We found support for some of Trump’s statistics but not others, such as the price of Thanksgiving turkeys.

The president made the misleading claim that “for the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation.” Year-over-year wages have been rising faster than inflation since June 2023, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

Trump falsely claimed that inflation when he took office was the “worst … in the history of our country” and that inflation had now “stopped.” Inflation was never the “worst” under Biden, and it was 3% for the 12 months ending in January. It rose 2.7% in the 12-month period ending in November.

He said, “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon, and in much of the country, in some states, it by the way just hit $1.99 a gallon.” The national average price was $2.90 a gallon the week of Dec. 15, and the lowest statewide average was $2.34 in Oklahoma.

Trump claimed that due to the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, “many families will be saving between $11,000 and $20,000 a year.” The Tax Policy Center estimated the average tax cut would be $800. Only those in the top 1% of households would see an average tax decrease of the amount Trump claimed.

Speaking about immigrants, Trump’s estimate that the U.S. was “invaded by an army of 25 million people” is vastly inflated; his claim that many of them came from “prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums” is unsupported, and his claim that the Biden administration allowed in “11,888 murderers” is wrong.

The president made the mathematically impossible claim that he was able “to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500 and even 600%.”

In his prime-time address, Trump spoke quickly, at twice the rate of his State of the Union address pace, according to a PBS News correspondent. The focus was mainly on the economy and “affordability.”

Prices

The president blamed his predecessor for “driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before,” but Trump said he is “bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast.”

“Under the Biden administration,” he said, “car prices rose 22%,” “gasoline rose 30 to 50%,” “hotel rates rose 37%,” and “airfares rose 31%.” He continued, “Now under our leadership, they’re all coming down and coming down fast.” He went on to say that “Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.” He added that “the price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year,” and claimed that “the price of eggs is down 82% since March.”

We found support for some of his figures, but none for others.

The White House told us that the price data for cars, hotels, airfares and gasoline came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but was not more specific. We checked the bureau’s Consumer Price Index data, the seasonally adjusted numbers, which did show price increases under Biden and mostly price decreases so far under Trump.

The CPI for new vehicles increased about 19% during Biden’s four-year term but has increased only slightly, by 0.2%, under Trump from January to November, according to the most recent BLS figures. Meanwhile, the CPI for airline fares went up almost 32% under Biden and has declined more than 9% under Trump. Also, the CPI for lodging away from home, including hotels and motels, rose over 33% under Biden and has dropped roughly 5% under Trump. Lastly, the CPI for gasoline, including all types, grew by 34.5% under Biden and has decreased about 4.6% under Trump.

The BLS also publishes average monthly price data for unleaded, regular gas and the most recent numbers, which are not seasonally adjusted, show an increase of 38% under Biden (from about $2.33 to $3.21) and a much smaller increase, about 0.6%, under Trump (from $3.21 to nearly $3.23). But those figures are different from the most recent weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration that show the average price of regular grade gas rising almost 31% under Biden (from $2.38 to $3.11 per gallon) and declining almost 7% under Trump (from $3.11 to $2.90, as of Dec. 15).

The source of Trump’s claim that turkey prices were down 33% for Thanksgiving is even less clear, as the White House provided no indication where the president got his figure. In a Nov. 19 news release, the American Farm Bureau Federation said that the average price of a 16-pound frozen turkey was down from the previous year, but only by 16%. The nonprofit advocacy group attributed the price decline to grocery stores offering special Thanksgiving deals, “attempting to draw consumer demand back to turkey, leading to lower retail prices for a holiday bird.” The wholesale prices that retailers paid for fresh turkeys were up from the year prior, the American Farm Bureau Federation said.

As for eggs, as of November, the average retail price for a dozen grade A white eggs was $2.86, down about 42% from $4.95 in January, according to the latest BLS data. Trump was likely referring to wholesale egg prices as of Dec. 12 being down 82% from the high of $8.17 in March, but wholesale prices are not what consumers pay at grocery stores. Egg prices spiked in 2024 after an avian influenza outbreak led to an egg shortage. When bird flu cases began to decline, so did wholesale egg prices, which eventually led to lower retail prices.

Overall, grocery prices, according to the CPI for “food-at-home items,” were up about 1.17% from January to November, and up about 1.9% since November 2024.

Wages

“Real,” meaning inflation-adjusted, wages have gone up since Trump took office in January, and they went down over the entirety of Biden’s tenure. But Trump made the misleading claim that “for the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation.”

Year-over-year wages have been rising faster than inflation since June 2023, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

As we’ve written before, the average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers rose 16.7% over Biden’s four years, but inflation increased by more. “Real” weekly earnings fell 4%; for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers, the decline was 2%. Inflation hit wage gains the hardest in the first half of Biden’s presidency, particularly in calendar year 2022. For the 12 months ending January 2025, Biden’s last year in office, real average weekly earnings went up 0.6%.

Under Trump, since January, those real average earnings have risen faster; they’re up 1.6%.

“It remains the case that both at the tail end of the Biden administration and the beginning of this Trump administration, real wages have been rising. That is to say, inflation has been rising more slowly than wages have been,” Gary Burtless, a senior fellow emeritus in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told us in a phone interview. Burtless said that his reading of various wage measures is that “the changes have not been terribly abrupt from the turnover of the Biden administration to the Trump administration.”

Trump referred to a real wage loss under Biden and wage gains in certain industries since January. A White House spokesperson told us that such figures refer to “annualized growth” using BLS real wage data, but we were unable to replicate the figures. For the industries Trump mentioned, since January, real average weekly earnings for the manufacturing and construction industries have both gone up 1.7%; mining and logging saw a 1% increase.

Inflation

At the top of his remarks, Trump said, “11 months ago, I inherited a mess and I’m fixing it. When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years and some would say in the history of our country.” He later said, “inflation is stopped.”

Inflation wasn’t “the worst … in the history of our country” when Trump returned to the White House in January. As we previously wrote, during Biden’s term there was a 9.1% increase in the Consumer Price Index in the 12 months ending in June 2022, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said was the biggest increase in over 40 years. But annual inflation growth moderated to just below 3% in the last six months of 2024. The U.S. suffered its worst inflation increase year-to-year following World War I, when there was a 23.7% rise from June 1919 to June 1920, and it was higher than the peak of Biden’s term during other periods of U.S. history.

Inflation hasn’t “stopped,” as Trump also claimed. The BLS reported on Dec. 18, the morning after Trump’s speech, that the CPI rose 2.7% over the 12-month period ending in November. (BLS didn’t collect data for October during the government shutdown, and didn’t start collecting November’s data until the 14th of that month.)

Gasoline

Returning to one of his favorite measures of economic success, Trump claimed, “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon, and in much of the country, in some states, it by the way just hit $1.99 a gallon.” Retail gasoline prices are lower than the national average of $3.11 for a gallon of regular gasoline when Trump took office, as we’ve written. But Trump exaggerated the average price now. It was $2.90 a gallon the week of Dec. 15, according to the Energy Information Administration.

He also exaggerated when he said “in some states” the price “just hit $1.99 a gallon.” According to data published by AAA, there were no states where the average price was $1.99 a gallon as of Dec. 18. The lowest statewide average was $2.34 in Oklahoma. (We found some individual stations in some states selling gasoline for $1.99 or less using GasBuddy, a site that provides information about prices at more than 150,000 stations.)

OBBBA Tax Cuts

Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act he signed in July “perhaps the most sweeping legislation ever passed in Congress” and touted provisions that include “no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.” (As we have said, fewer seniors would pay taxes on Social Security benefits, but millions of Americans would still have to pay.)

Trump claimed that because of the tax cuts in the law, “many families will be saving between $11,000 and $20,000 a year, and next spring is projected to be the largest tax refund season of all time.” An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the average 2025 tax cut from the legislation is $800.

“I don’t know what Trump means by ‘many’ but the only income group that gets an average tax cut that exceeds even $9k are those in the top 1 percent, who make $1.1 million a year or more,” Howard Gleckman, a nonresident fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us via email.

When the White House’s own Council of Economic Advisers analyzed a Senate-proposed version of the bill in June, it estimated that within four years, the potential increase in take-home pay for a typical family with two children would be between $7,600 and $10,900. But as we wrote then, the CEA estimate was based on an assumption that real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product would increase by more than 4% each year, at least for the first four years under the bill. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget labeled those “fantasy growth assumptions” that “are many times higher” than the estimates of other independent analysts that have modeled versions of the bill.

Immigrants

Trump repeated several inflated, unsupported or misleading claims about immigrants who came to the U.S. during Biden’s presidency.

“Our border was open and because of this, our country was being invaded by an army of 25 million people, many who came from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump said. “They were drug dealers, gang members, and even 11,888 murderers, more than 50% of whom killed more than one person. This is what the Biden administration allowed to happen to our country and it can never be allowed to happen again.”

Trump’s estimate of 25 million unauthorized immigrants coming into the U.S. during Biden’s presidency is far too high. We calculated in June 2024 that the figure would be about a third of that, including an estimated 2 million “gotaways” who evaded capture by Border Patrol and about 3 million people released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the future, or other classifications, such as parole.

The Pew Research Center estimates that as of 2023 there were 14 million “unauthorized immigrants” residing in the U.S. in total, which includes those with some protection from deportation, such as parole or having applied for asylum. That’s nearly 4 million more than the 10.2 million estimate from the Pew Research Center for 2019.

Trump also repeated — as he does in virtually every speech — his unsupported claim that many of the immigrants who came to the U.S. during the Biden administration were released from “prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums.” Trump has never provided any credible evidence of that.

Finally, Trump’s claim that “11,888 murderers” were “allowed” into the country during the Biden administration is misleading. As we have written, there were about that many noncitizens who had been convicted of murder but were not in ICE custody as of September 2024 — a list known as the agency’s non-detained docket.

But the “vast majority” of them entered the country prior to the Biden administration and had their custody status determined “long before this Administration,” the Department of Homeland Security told us in September 2024, noting that many were in prison. Also, the noncitizens include those who entered the country legally, such as green-card holders. Some of them may also have been deported. We don’t know the source of Trump’s claim that “more than 50%” or those on the list “killed more than one person.”

Drug Prices

Trump made the mathematically impossible claim that he was able “to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500 and even 600%,” by negotiating “with the drug companies and foreign nations, which were taking advantage of our country for many decades.” Of course, such reductions would suggest that drug companies were paying consumers to take their products, instead of the other way around.

In a May press conference on drug prices, Trump made comparisons similar to his 400% to 600% price-drop claims. Then, Trump cherry-picked in saying that drug prices were higher in the U.S. than in other countries sometimes by “a factor of five, six, seven, eight times. … There are even cases of 10 times higher.”

Andrew W. Mulcahy, a senior health economist at RAND, a global policy research organization based in California, told us at the time that it was “broadly correct” to say the U.S. has higher drug prices than other countries, and “you can find examples of 5, 6, 7 or 8 times, or more, higher” for individual drugs. But on average, prices in the U.S. were 2.78 times higher compared with 33 other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, according to a RAND report based on 2022 data. The average price was 4.22 times higher for brand-name drugs, which account for 10% of the prescriptions filled in the U.S.

Other Repeats

Eight ‘settled’ wars. As he often does, Trump claimed to have “settled eight wars in 10 months.” As we have written, international relations experts said the president has had a significant role in ending fighting in five conflicts, though officials in one country (India) refute Trump’s claim. But some of the international disagreements Trump cites have not been wars, and some clashes have not ended.

Housing. Touting his housing reform plans and criticizing Biden’s immigration policies, Trump also said, “A major factor in driving up housing costs was the colossal border invasion.” Vice President JD Vance made a similar misleading claim about the cause of housing prices rising during Biden’s term, as we’ve written. Immigration does affect housing prices by increasing demand, but economists told us the main causes of higher prices in recent years were low mortgage interest rates that fueled demand, a subsequent rise in interest rates, and a low housing supply dating to the Great Recession in 2007 to 2009. Immigrants in the country illegally are more likely to rent than buy, experts also said.

Electricity. The president said, “Electricity costs surged 30 to 100% under Biden. … On Day One, I declared a national energy emergency.” The cost of electricity did increase by 30% — not 100% — during Biden’s presidency, according to the CPI for electricity. But the cost of electricity continued to tick up under Trump from January to November, rising 6.8%, the BLS data show.

Jobs. Trump again made the claim that “there are more people working today than at any time in American history.” It’s correct, but it doesn’t mean much, as we’ve written. The BLS reported there were nearly 160 million total nonfarm employees as of November, the highest number of workers in history. But the U.S. also has its largest population in history.

“In November, both the labor force participation rate (62.5 percent) and the employment-population ratio (59.6 percent) were little changed from September. These measures showed little or no change over the year,” the BLS reported on Dec. 16. (The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the total population over age 16 that is either employed or actively seeking work.)

Investments. In his prime-time address, Trump said, “Already, I’ve secured a record breaking $18 trillion of investment into the United States” through his tariffs policy. But a White House webpage that purportedly tabulates “Total U.S. and Foreign Investments” made since Trump returned to office reports about half that, $9.6 trillion, taken in so far.

Experts say that even that number is questionable because it includes pledges and planned investments that may not come to fruition.“[T]hey’re just promises — and often vague ones at that,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute, said in an April analysis of Trump’s investment claims.",https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/Trump-Address-720-x-307.png,N,,2025-12-19 11:59:14.453044

On December 13th, several migrant organizations came together with engaged social movements to exchange experiences and strategies – and here we share some highlight reflections.

Migrants in a global and regional context

This year, the International Migrants Day comes on December 18th amid an unprecedented forced displacement of people globally and escalating attacks on migrants including refugees, and their rights. This is taking place against the backdrop of the intensifying crisis of capitalism and imperialism in the world, the escalation of wars, genocide and settler colonial occupation, and illegal o in Palestine ; the destruction of nature and humanity, impoverishment, and widespread starvation. This comes together with the violation of fundamental human rights and collective and individual freedoms throughout the world, amid the global rise of the fascist right forces, its accession to power and place in governments, and its domination of the international political arena.

In the United States, the re-elected President, began his second term by immediately continuing the building of the racist wall separating Mexico and the United States on the one hand, and imposing the most repressive anti-migrant and anti-immigrant policies and measures in the history of the United States. In this country, built by immigrants and a country of immigration, the streets of the largest American cities are turned into real war zones and hunting grounds for immigrants, who are arrested, brutally assaulted, imprisoned, and illegally deported in a terrifying fascist spectacle.

As for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the rest of the Caribbean, the region is witnessing the forced dislocation and movement of people due to the fact that more than two million displaced persons and refugees from Haiti are forced to cross one of the most dangerous migration routes to America, where migrants are subjected to the worst forms of exploitation, slavery, human trafficking, and other crimes.

In Europe, as in the US, the fundamental rights of migrant and refugee people, have also been systematically dismantled. In all countries in Europe, including in the member states of the European Union, the questions of migration and asylum have been turned into racist and fascist political rhetoric as the rightist political parties continue to gain power. The Mediterranean Sea has been made into a mega graveyard of migrant and refugee people – not only because of over crowded fragile boats, but also with the deliberate government policy of prohibition and refusal to rescue at sea by European coast guards, but also the policy of blockade undertaken by Frontex, and other forces such as the “Libyan coastguard” – all financed by the EU budget/European taxpayers money – which results in fatal confrontations at sea. Citizen-led humanitarian search and rescue ships (such as SOS Mediterranee) are frequently blocked in their mission, subjected to armed attack and arrest of ships, which also leads to criminalization and court processes. Another trend is the normalization of hate speech, and system crimes against migrant and refugee people, summary detention and deportation and the externalization and securitization of Europe’s border regime to countries in Africa. At the same time, there is ‘policy standardization’ with the preparation for the full obligatory implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum across the EU member states – which has essentially dismantled fundamental human rights and replaced this by repressive ‘management’ policies and mechanisms.

In Africa, wars, poverty, and famine force hundreds of thousands of impoverished and marginalized people to migrate. These are our brothers and sisters in sub-Saharan Africa and the African Sahel, who are forced to cross the immense Sahara and sail the Mediterranean Sea in death boats in an attempt to reach Europe, fleeing their painful and terrifying reality and seeking livelihood and a better life.

In Asia, we also see more than a million forcibly displaced Rohingya

people fleeing persecution and military repression in Myanmar, who have crossed the border to Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries as Thailand. Most recently, the military confrontations on the Thai-Cambodia border is leading to further forced displacements. At the same time migrant workers women and men, especially from Philippines and Indonesia, are providing a vital labor force in other South East and East Asian economies – frequently in conditions of precarity of contracts and violation of labor and fundamental human rights. Similarly, many thousands of women and men workers from South Asia – India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal are particularly concentrated in the Gulf States.

In the Arabian Gulf, similar conditions of exploitation prevail, and in addition migrants remain subject to the slave-like sponsorship (Kafala ) system and all forms of slavery and mistreatment against domestic workers and laborers.

Global Restructuring of Labor

Under the conditions of neoliberal globalization, huge sectors of manufacturing and production were moved from the Global North to establish supply chains that took advantage of cheaper labor in the countries of the Global South. At the same time very essential sectors of the economy could not be “outsourced “ to the global south – agriculture, domestic, health and care work, tourism services, oil- rig work and construction work. Therefore these sectors relied heavily on migrant labour from the global south.

Many peasants and rural workers were forced to leave their villages due to land grabbing by mega Agribusiness companies and pesticide driven model of agriculture that destroys the livelihoods of farmers and serves only the profits of the large corporations. Many are also forced to work in agriculture, either in transit countries or in destination countries, in precarious conditions and without social protection. They are exposed to labor accidents and to the use of chemicals and pesticides, without any protection.

While remittances have long helped prop up the economies of labor-sending countries like the Philippines, this reality comes at a steep and often ignored social cost. Large-scale labor migration has meant brain drain, the weakening of essential public services, and deep social wounds borne by workers’ families and communities. Migrant labor should never be treated as an economic crutch or a development strategy. Decent jobs at home—not forced migration—must remain the goal.

Likewise, during the past decades, the economies of the global north, have also relied on migrant workers for domestic, care and health services and for work in the tourist economy. However the living and working conditions are extremely exploitative and workplaces are frequently “sites without rights “ – including deliberative policies where many thousands of migrants are forced to become “undocumented”.

Migrant movements organize and build resistance

Migrant workers historically and currently are playing a major role in the economies of the global north, while at the same time contributing substantially through their remittances to the economies of their home countries in the global south – a source of foreign currency often earmarked to pay the foreign debt.

In the face of all the challenges they encounter globally as outlined above, migrant and refugee people continue to organize, protest, and resist this oppression.

Migrant and immigrant organizations and those movements and organizations in engaged solidarity – continue to raise the banner of struggle and resistance and system change and concluded the December 13th exchange resolved to:

pursue the campaign for regularization for all !

generate a new narrative – shifting the discourse while building on the achievements and contributions of migrant and refugee people – politically, economically and culturally

recall and affirm that the history of humanity is a history of migration par excellence, that the most powerful and advanced countries in the world were built by migrants, that migration is a fundamental human right, and that it is a movement of resistance against injustice, exploitation, colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism

continue to build the Pact of Solidarity as our collective response and commitment to system change for a world of justice and peace for all!

To Migrate is a fundamental human right and a movement of resistance and should not be criminalized.

Borders should not be death zones

Dignity should not be negotiable

Down with all borders!

Long live the International Migrants Day !

The December 15 order directs the defense secretary and attorney general to “determine whether the threats posed by fentanyl and its impact on the United States” justifies the Defense Department aiding the Justice Department in law enforcement.

The order states that fentanyl has the potential “to be weaponized for concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.” But domestic and international law already authorize responsive action if fentanyl were employed as a chemical weapon.

This order is particularly worrying amid the Trump administration’s use of drug trafficking as a pretext to justify unlawful military strikes. Since September, the administration has carried out more than two dozen strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in at least 99 extrajudicial killings. This context raises the concern that the order aims to facilitate an expansion of such unlawful actions.

The executive order is also dangerous in the current domestic context, following months of National Guard deployments to multiple US cities. While US law enforcement agencies commit many human rights abuses, the involvement of the military in law enforcement would pose additional risks. Military forces bring fundamentally different training and experience to bear, focused less on rights-respecting law enforcement and more on the effective use of lethal force.

While governments have a legitimate interest in working to stop drug trafficking, addressing the harm of unregulated fentanyl requires an emphasis on evidence-based public health interventions. Militarized policing in US communities could unleash serious abuses, especially against Black and other overpoliced communities. US drug policy has historically fueled racially discriminatory policing, arrests, and incarceration.

WASHINGTON–Today, the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the Trump administration’s latest proposals to implement two nationwide rules that would significantly shut down access in hospitals to gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. The proposed measures follow the recent House passage of legislation aimed at criminalizing such care and represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into the private medical decisions of families and their doctors.

The administration’s proposal seeks to block the provision of evidence-based, medically necessary care for transgender people under 18—care that is supported by every major medical association in the United States, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“These gratuitous proposals are cruel and unconstitutional attacks on the rights of transgender youth and their families,” said Chase Strangio, Co-Director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Rights Project. “By attempting to strip away essential healthcare, the administration is not 'protecting' anyone; it is weaponizing the federal government to target a vulnerable population for political gain. Healthcare decisions belong to families and their doctors, not politicians. The latest proposals from the administration would force doctors to choose between their ethical obligations to their patients and the threat of losing federal funding. It would uproot families who have already fled state-level bans, leaving them with nowhere to turn for the care they need to survive and thrive.

“We have seen the devastating consequences of similar policies at the state level, and we have fought them every step of the way. Let us be clear: If this administration moves forward with this attempt to enact a national ban on our medical care through coercion, the ACLU will see them in court. We will not rest until the rights of transgender youth to live authentically and access the care they need are fully protected.”

Why we mobilised

We mobilised to demand dignity, safety and justice for all migrant workers, and to stand against the government’s escalating attacks on migrant workers’ rights: changes to workers’ visas and proposed changes to settlement and citizenship.

This is not an abstract policy shift. These changes exclude and exploit workers, via even more insecure visas, increased salary thresholds, families being kept apart, even more lengthy routes for people to settle here, and more immigration raids – policies that treat migrant workers as disposable while extracting their labour. They come at a time of increasing anti-migrant government rhetoric and persistent mis-/disinformation from politicians and sections of the media.

This threatens the lives of our friends, loved ones, neighbours and colleagues. Many of us at JCWI are directly affected. The proposals push more families into poverty, insecurity, and create further barriers for people who have already contributed so much to the UK.

These injustices are entirely deliberate, the direct result of government policy. They are enforced through the hostile environment and normalised across UK society — from employers and landlords to consumers and institutions — while governments and private companies profit from the border regime.

Migrants have the right to decent working conditions, family life, secure settlement and access to support. Instead of fixing underfunded public services, migrants are being scapegoated and blamed for government failures.

Led by migrant justice groups including Regularise, JCWI, Migrants’ Rights Network, Tulia and India Labour Solidarity, the mobilisation was a strong show of collective resistance to these harmful new policies. We marched through Birmingham with the support of unions including RMT, IWGB, UVW, UCU, ITF and SWU, and other community organisations, including the Existing Skilled Migrants Forum.

What happened on Saturday

Saturday’s march was led by migrants directly affected by these changes. People who have already lived through uncertainty and paid huge fees. Trade union members who see the impact in their workplaces. People stood together to say that migrants belong in every community and workplace, and to demand an end to the Hostile Environment. We also stood in solidarity with refugees and people seeking asylum who are denied the right to work, and already face unacceptable delays to their applications.

Under President Donald Trump, federal immigration officials have dramatically expanded their efforts to identify, detain and deport immigrants they say are in the U.S. illegally.

Since the start of 2025, New England has seen a tenfold increase in the number of immigrants who were deported, compared to last year.

This big push requires the participation of federal, regional and local institutions — something that’s been happening across New England over the past year.

In Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, county jails are holding ICE detainees. Regional airports handle ICE flights to prisons in other states.

Federal prisons, immigration courts and ICE administration offices in New England have taken on extra cases or new work.

Here’s a map illustrating the growing immigration infrastructure in New England.

The arrests

Last year, between Jan. 20 and Dec. 2, 2024, ICE made 2,044 arrests in the Boston “area of responsibility,” a region that consists of Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, according to an ICE spokesperson.

During that same time period in 2025, the spokesperson said ICE made four times as many arrests — 8,848.

ICE officials have targeted people at their workplaces, including design companies, construction sites, restaurants, dairy farms and car washes. They’ve arrested people off the streets, at the airport, en route to the dentist, and outside their homes. They’ve also arrested people during scheduled check-in appointments with ICE and inside court houses. Minor infractions like a DUI can tip off ICE to make arrests.

The region has also seen organized ICE raids, like a four-day operation in Connecticut in August, during which 65 people were apprehended. In September, ICE’s “Operation Patriot 2.0” netted 1,400 arrests in Massachusetts.

U.S. Border Patrol also plays a big role in immigration arrests in New England, particularly in Maine. Agents from the Houlton Sector, which covers all of Maine, arrested 725 people during the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2025, a new record.

Some of the arrests in Maine have come through informal cooperation with state and local law enforcement. That was the case for a Maine carpenter from Brazil who was pulled over in May 2025 by a state trooper for an improperly-placed license plate and a missing plate light. The state trooper called Border Patrol to help verify the man’s documents, and he was taken into custody and later sent to an ICE detention facility in Texas. He was eventually released and is now back in Maine.

Some New England law enforcement agencies have officially partnered with ICE through a federal program that deputizes local officers to carry out federal immigration enforcement.

State police, county sheriffs and local police in New Hampshire began signing these 287(g) agreements in late February 2025 and were approved by ICE rapidly. That’s despite a statewide “fair and impartial” policing policy that prevents state police from stopping people only on the suspicion of their immigration status.

Of the 13 signed 287(g) agreements in New England, 12 are in New Hampshire and one is with the Massachusetts Department of Correction, according to ICE.

In Massachusetts, ICE arrests in local courthouses ballooned in 2025. In May, the Massachusetts Trial Court issued a new policy detailing how court staff should interact with ICE, though it hasn’t always been followed.

ICE is also developing new ways of identifying people to arrest. In several unassuming buildings outside Burlington, Vermont, a specialized intelligence hub for ICE known as the Law Enforcement Support Center is gathering information about immigration status and identity that is being used to make arrests around the country. It also processes tips.

The facility has been in Vermont since former Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy secured funding for it in 1994, and its work is expected to expand. ICE is looking to hire 100 more people to staff the tip line housed at the Williston, Vermont facility, the weekly newspaper Seven Days reported.

Williston is also home to a second ICE facility, the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. In October, Wired reported that the agency was seeking to hire analysts to expand surveillance of social media to identify ICE targets.

Detention

Every state in New England except Connecticut has at least one facility that’s holding immigration detainees. These prisons and jails are owned and run through various entities, like county sheriffs, state and quasi public-owned companies, and the federal government.

Once arrested, it’s common for people to be taken to a detention facility in another part of New England, or outside the region.

For instance, Rosanne Ferreira-De Oliveira, a housekeeper and mother of four, was detained by ICE in Worcester, Massachusetts, but was sent to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she was held for five months.

Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk was arrested by ICE on the streetin Somerville, Massachusetts, and taken by van to Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in Vermont, then flown to Louisiana via the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, all within a 24-hour period, without having access to an attorney. She has since been released and has pending immigration and habeas cases.

ICE also has held people at a local processing center in an office building in Burlington, Massachusetts.

ICE also has held people at a local processing center in an office building in Burlington, Massachusetts.

Typically, people are transferred from there to a longer-term detention facility in a matter of hours. But beginning in May 2025, as the Trump administration ramped up arrests in Massachusetts and beds in regional detention centers filled up, the stays in Burlington got longer — more than a week in some cases.

Former detainees and immigration lawyers described conditions in the overcrowded holding rooms as “abysmal” and “inhumane.” They say there are no beds, so people sleep on concrete floors or benches. Each holding room has one toilet that offers little privacy. Many said they weren’t fed enough food, and women reported a shortage of menstrual products.

The conditions inside Burlington have sparked an outcry from the public, and people protest outside of the building several days a week. Elected officials have also been involved, pushing ICE for information about the number of people being detained and the conditions of their detention. In December, U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. toured the building. He reported that conditions inside haven’t changed much since his visit in June, though he said ICE seemed to be moving people through Burlington more quickly. In mid-December, activists were arrested on the property while delivering care packages to detainees there.

People in other parts of New England have been protesting ICE detention contracts as well.

In Maine, activists have been pushing commissioners to stop letting ICE detain people at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.

In Vermont, the high-profile arrest in April 2025 of Moshen Mahdawi, a local resident and pro-Palestinian activist, led lawmakers and activists to question an agreement between the state’s Department of Corrections and federal immigration authorities. Gov. Phil Scott said the arrangement is preferable to sending people elsewhere, and the state renewed its contract with ICE in September.

Advocates in Massachusetts are working to prevent more agreements from being forged there. In November GBH News surveyed all counties in Massachusetts and the Department of Corrections. It found those with existing contracts - Plymouth County and the Department of Correction - plan to continue them, but other counties that replied to the survey said they have no interest.

In contrast, county officials in New Hampshire’s Rockingham County are considering a new detention contract there.

New England airports

New Englanders also have been debating the use of the region’s airports for transporting immigrants. Activists have held several protests and called for a boycott against budget airline Avelo in Connecticut and New Hampshire, after the airline agreed to charter deportation flights out of other states.

Activists have also scrutinized flights from Hanscom Field in Massachusetts and Portsmouth International Airport in New Hampshire.

On Dec. 15, Gov. Maura Healey demanded ICE stop using the Hanscom Field airport to transfer and deport individuals. In 2025, through November, 114 ICE flights departed from the airfield in Bedford, according to the ICE Flight Monitor from Human Rights First. In the first half of the year, the Plymouth County Sheriff’s Office transported hundreds of detainees to Hanscom, to be flown to other ICE locations.

ICE has used the Portsmouth, New Hampshire airport, also known as Pease, off and on since July. The agency hasn’t said why or how many people are on these flights. But a handful of activists are counting the number of detainees boarding these flights, part of a wider effort to pressure local officials to stop the use of Pease as a deportation hub. Airport leadership says their hands are tied.

In Vermont, ICE has used commercial flights out of the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to move detainees out of the state. Activists called on airport officials to block that activity, but officials determined ICE was entitled to use public areas of the airport, according to a legal memo. In October, activists told the news outlet VTDigger that ICE officials appeared to no longer be using the airport.

Immigration Courts

Immigration legal cases are heard in three courthouses in New England – in Boston and Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and in Hartford, Connecticut. The Chelmsford court has seen a host of firings of immigration judges, as the Trump administration has terminated many appointed under President Joe Biden.

With limited detention capacity in New England and a massive ramp-up in enforcement, ICE has transferred many detainees to other parts of the country. That has brought civil immigration cases into federal court, as lawyers have scrambled to file habeas corpus complaints to stop ICE from removing detainees from the state.

For instance, Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Öztürk, who was arrested in Massachusetts and transferred to Louisiana via Vermont, had her case heard by a U.S. district court judge in Vermont, where she had been briefly in custody when the habeas was filed.

Deportation

Mass deportation is the end goal of the Trump administration, and in the last year, the number of deportations in New England increased tenfold.

Between Jan. 20 and Dec. 2, 2024, ICE made 933 removals in New England. During that same period in 2025, the agency conducted 9,987 removals in New England, according to an ICE spokesman.

Some of the people deported include dairy farm workers in Vermont, a father of three in Chelsea, Massachusetts and a freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, who was on her way home to visit family in Texas for Thanksgiving.

Others are choosing self-deportation. The family of a 13-year-old boy from Everett, Massachusetts, who was arrested in October 2025 and detained in Virginia, asked a judge if he could voluntarily return to Brazil. A family in Springfield, Massachusetts, was preparing to self-deport after receiving instructions to do so on sticky notes from ICE, before a judge issued a temporary emergency order that allowed them to stay. The father was eventually detained at an ICE check-in.

A Revere woman with family ties to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was arrested by ICE in November. Bruna Ferreira shares a son with Leavitt’s brother, Michael Leavitt. While Ferreira, a Brazilian national, is fighting deportation, her ex urged her to self-deport.

Some families have been making arrangements for guardianship in case parents are detained or deported.

Others who have been arrested by ICE have later been released.

New Hampshire resident Fabian Schmidt was arrested at Logan Airport in Boston and held at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island for 2 months before he was released and returned home. Lucas Segobia, a carpenter, is back home in Searsport, Maine after being arrested by Border Patrol and held in Texas. Paul Dama, the manager of Suya Joint, an award-winning West African restaurant in Boston, was released after nearly 100 days in ICE custody in New Hampshire.

In July, ICE agents detained a high school student in New Haven, CT, drawing condemnation and pushback from his fellow students, local officials and community advocates. The student was detained in Louisiana, but was eventually able to fight his slated deportation to Guatemala.

He returned home to a celebratory rally from his community.

How does systemic racism influence migration policies, asylum systems and border enforcement?

Borders are not simply lines on a map or physical barriers separating one place from another. They are a complex infrastructure of control, social ordering and exclusion shaped by racial hierarchies rooted in histories of colonialism, slavery and other forms of oppression such as patriarchy. Experts talk about “racial borders”, referring to the ways migration policies, asylum systems, and border enforcement reproduce systemic racism and racial discrimination.

These systems are used to create and enforce illegality and vulnerability. This includes who is ‘in’ or ‘out’, who should be treated with suspicion, who should be scapegoated during a crisis, who should be denied movement and who is disposable.

In modern border regimes, white people are privileged over racialized people who are excluded, often violently.

How are borders shaped or influenced by colonialism?

During colonial times, borders were shaped, imposed or influenced in ways that reflected and reinforced colonial power dynamics and ideologies, establishing and globalizing white supremacy and constructing racial hierarchies.

The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, for example, established rules for the colonization of Africa and divided up vast territory between European powers with complete disregard of the continent’s indigenous populations. During the same period, passports and visa systems were created as basic systems of mobility control, to identify foreigners, limit their ability to travel and manage the use of migrant labour.

How is that reflected in migration systems today?

Today’s migration policies and practices reproduce biases developed during colonial times, for example the idea that colonists can travel freely between their country of origin and its colonies, while colonised people can’t. Colonised people can only travel to the colonial country to provide it with cheap labour.

These biases are reproduced in contemporary migration policies, as nationals of Global North countries can travel more easily and widely than nationals of Global South countries – and with more favourable visa conditions.

Amnesty International has exposed visa policies in several countries that intend to allow cheap labour from Global South countries but in fact expose racialised migrant workers to labour exploitation and other human rights violations.

What does the term “digital racial borders” refer to?

According to E. Tendayi Achiume, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the term “digital racial borders” refers to the ways digital technologies deployed in asylum and migration contexts help entrench racial inequalities and racial harm.

Digital technology is increasingly shaping and delivering migration and asylum policies, from electronic monitoring, satellites, and drones to facial recognition, algorithmic decision-making in visa processes, “lie detectors” and iris scanning. The growth of digital technologies and so-called “smart border” technology have created new partnerships between governments and companies, and with them a range of threats to human rights. Racism is deeply ingrained within migration and asylum systems, so these technologies risk exacerbating racial biases and discrimination.

How are racial borders affecting people?

Racial borders create an underclass of exploited racialized migrant workers. For example, states employ exploitative visa policies designed to facilitate the employment of cheap migrant labour. These policies place migrants in very vulnerable positions.

We have documented how migration policies create or contribute to labour exploitation of racialized migrant workers in a number of countries across the world including Canada, France, Hong Kong/China, Italy, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

Also, migration policies, asylum systems and border enforcement often expose racialized people to discrimination and life-threatening risks, treating their lives as disposable and less worthy of protection. Amnesty International has documented this in the Dominican Republic, where migration policies have led to mass expulsions that disproportionately affect Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent, often implemented through racial profiling and other human rights violations.

Are there limits to states’ discretion in deciding who can visit and live in their countries?

Yes. Like any other state power, the power of states to decide who can visit and live on their territory is limited by their human rights obligations.

Under international human rights law, the prohibition of racial discrimination protects migrants and refugees from discriminatory treatment based on race, skin colour, descent, national or ethnic origin. International human rights law also includes separate protections against discrimination on other grounds such as religion, gender, disability, among others, which can often be racialized.

One of the ways in which States try to justify harmful policies and practices is to maintain a false narrative that borders are designed to protect, when in fact they are designed to control, extract and exclude.

This approach allows states to focus public attention on so-called border “crises” rather than looking into the root causes of displacement, mobility and immobility. In fact, states determine who can move and who can’t with their migration policies – and they often have a structural role in contributing to the root causes of displacement. It also shapes how support for refugees and migrants is imagined. Rather than a matter of justice and rights, it becomes a question of charity.

What should be done?

There’s much that can, and must, be done. In the short term, states must abandon discriminatory and exploitative migration policies, like visas that tie workers to one employer or discriminate against elderly and disabled people.

States must also stop surveillance and violence as means of border control and management. Migration policies must ensure that the rights of those who move or would like to move are protected and be guided by values of justice, dignity, and solidarity, centring those who have been historically marginalized at the heart of policy making.

In the long term, we must work towards a world where colonial ways of thinking, racial capitalism, and other violent mindsets do not shape policies, our experiences or our relationships with one another. It’s possible to imagine a better way of living together, where mobility and community life aren’t shaped by racial hierarchies but strengthened through mutual care and respect.

The effort to protect immigrant gathering places, ban masked agents and combat other federal law enforcement tactics comes as state Democrats, emboldened by successes in the courts and at the ballot box, aim to attack the Trump administration politically on rule-of-law issues, such as violations of constitutional protections. They are also tapping into anxiety in immigrant communities, which has fueled concern among immigrant and nonimmigrant voters alike.

“It’s never been more important in our lifetimes that like-minded state legislators, like those here, work together to share ideas and strategies,” said State Senator Mike Weissman of Colorado, who represents Aurora, which Mr. Trump has targeted as a hotbed of Venezuelan gang activity. “States are not just laboratories of democracy, as Justice Louis Brandeis famously said. They are also laboratories where remedies are being developed to protect our country from the disease of authoritarianism that is spreading out from Washington, D.C.”

The legislative push augments what a bloc of up to 20 attorneys general have done over the last year through lawsuits on challenging administration policies such as stratospheric H1B visa fees, the withholding of antiterrorism funds and the firing of federal workers.

The coordinated effort is reminiscent of what conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council and the State Policy Network have long done on issues such as promoting Christian values in schools, restricting abortion and limiting diversity initiatives, according to Gaby Goldstein, who founded State Futures, which organizes Democratic lawmakers, and who facilitated Thursday’s event.

She wrote in a recent essay that when it comes to drafting model bills that legislatures can use, along with assembling officials and disseminating ideas across the country, “the right has long done it better.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, was unimpressed.

“Instead of useless P.R. stunts that cater to Resistance Liberals, these Democrat lawmakers should spend their time supporting policies that will actually benefit their American constituents,” she said.

A dozen legislators from seven states joined Thursday’s event: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

Individual Democratic states have already moved forward. A smattering of legislatures, for instance, passed legislation this year that banned agreements that delegate some federal immigration powers to state and municipal law enforcement agencies. Several states have proposed banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers.

Now they believe they have more momentum.

Irene Shin, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who represents Fairfax County outside of Washington, D.C., said that the Democrats’ robust performance in November’s elections would make it easier to pass “a comprehensive legislative agenda to protect our communities and push back against the federal overreach.” Virginia Democrats won all three statewide races in November and secured a near two-thirds majority in the Statehouse.

Ms. Shin mentioned banning cooperation agreements on immigration enforcement and shielding private data from federal agencies.

State Assemblyman Micah Lasher of New York, who represents Manhattan’s Upper West Side, said he had cosponsored legislation to declare certain places such as schools, houses of worship and nonprofit offices as off-limits to federal agents trying to make administrative arrests or arrests without a judicial warrant. That way, he said, “our neighbors can function freely in our communities and deal with the basic needs of life, and do so not in the shadows.”

Similar legislation was enacted this month in Illinois.

State Senator Amanda Cappelletti of Pennsylvania, who represents a slice of suburban Philadelphia, said she would redouble her efforts on legislation that would require mandatory identification for law enforcement officers, including their name, their badge number and an agency or department-issued uniform. Another bill would prohibit officers and agents from wearing facial coverings or garments to obscure their identity, punishable by civil or criminal penalties.

Her constituents, she said, have been watching their neighbors get picked up and detained without due process. “It is absolutely unacceptable,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/18/multimedia/18nat-states-pushback-1-kjlb/18nat-states-pushback-1-kjlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 01:57:38.341552

At first glance, the changes seemed routine—some AI software programs were marked “inactive,” and a new one was added. But upon closer examination, the removal of the AI use cases does not appear to indicate a retreat from—but an expansion of—those AI capabilities.

Taken alongside reporting from The Guardian and Wired, the update points to broader trends in immigration enforcement: deploying similar AI functions within larger vendor-run platforms and expanding into continuous surveillance systems that pull in and analyze far more information than before.

Two months earlier, in May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported using 23 active AI software programs for immigration enforcement. By July, four of those had become “inactive,” and one—Email Analytics for Investigative Data—was moved back to “implementation and assessment” phase for reconfiguration under a new system. At face value, this looks like a pullback in AI programs. However, recent reports show there is more going on. Many similar features are part of larger AI software platforms that generate automated decisions that are harder to oversee.

Program changes made to the DHS AI inventory include:

Email Analytics for Investigative Data: Active (returned to reassessment). Automates sorting, translation, and entity extraction from seized emails.

Mobile Device Analytics for Investigative Data: Inactive. Parsed data from seized phones and devices.

Identification Card & Travel Doc Code Detection: Inactive. Used computer vision to scan IDs.

Voice Analytics for Investigative Data: Inactive. Transcribed and translated audio.

Video Analysis Tool (VAT): Inactive. Flagged faces and video snippets.

DHS also discontinued its use of three commercial generative AI services (for code, images, and chatbots) and added one new pilot program: the LIGER GenAI Toolkit, designed to support federal workers with tasks like drafting contracts and summarizing documents.

From specialized programs to big data platforms

The DHS AI Use Case inventory lists programs as separate entries, but in practice, these programs rarely operate in isolation. Investigations by The Guardian, Wired, and NPR reveal that ICE increasingly relies on large vendor-built platforms—such as Palantir’s comprehensive immigration systems, Clearview AI’s facial-recognition tools, BI2’s iris-scanning devices, and Paragon’s phone-hacking software—that pull together many different forms of data and analysis in one place.

Palantir’s platforms, for example, have been used by ICE to analyze driver’s license scans, extract information from seized phones, cross-search location data, and link records from federal, state, and commercial databases. Wired reported that these tools combine social media posts, travel records, tax data, and phone extractions into unified investigative files. NPR also documented the use of mobile facial-recognition apps and iris scanners in field operations.

Considering these new ICE contracts, the underlying functions of DHS’s “inactive” AI programs—ID scanning, mobile device analytics, video analysis, audio transcription—clearly persist across newer contracts and technologies. ID scanning now appears in field apps like Mobile Fortify; mobile device analytics continue through tools from Cellebrite and Paragon; voice, video, and text analysis feed into social-media and communication-monitoring platforms from Zignal Labs and PenLink.

Such integration carries troubling risks. When dozens of discrete tools are fused into a single “black box,” oversight becomes harder. As functions consolidate in one large system, it becomes increasingly unclear how someone was identified and harder for any watchdog to trace the steps behind a decision. What data is used? How is it weighted? What errors or biases carry forward? Without transparency, accountability diffuses.

Ultimately, AI-driven outputs begin to shape enforcement decisions in ways that are difficult to challenge. As the system grows more opaque, enforcement decisions end up driven by the final output rather than any understandable process.

Vendor platforms and the new surveillance pipeline

Following a wave of vendor-built AI programs, ICE’s next moves show expansion. Procurement documents uncovered by Wired reveal that ICE plans to hire nearly 30 contractors to monitor social media platforms—Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube—around the clock. Analysts would turn posts, photos, and profiles into enforcement “leads” for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Division. ICE asked the contractors to indicate how they would integrate AI into their work, and the analysts would be equipped with the latest surveillance tools.

This marks a shift from static software programs designed to log data to continuous, real-time surveillance of everyday online life. As noted in a previous Council blog on Palantir’s ImmigrationOS, ICE is increasingly relying on vendor-built systems that combine case management, biometrics, link analysis, and surveillance tools into a single environment.

When viewed alongside this trend, the July AI inventory update looks less like a reduction in DHS’s use of AI and more like a reorganization. Programs marked “inactive” on paper are not disappearing; similar functions continue in larger, always-on systems. This update enables continuous, AI-assisted surveillance pipelines—systems that automate monitoring, sift through social and digital data, and surface “high-priority” individuals for enforcement.

Together, these developments reveal the same concern: so-called neutral or “technical” systems are, in fact, the products of policy choices. Algorithm design decisions—what data to ingest, how to categorize risk, when to flag someone—shape who gets targeted, detained, or deported. Treating these platforms as neutral obscures the fact that they are political technologies, crafted by people and influenced by institutional priorities.

The July DHS AI Use Case Inventory may look like a shuffle of line items, but it signals deeper shifts in immigration enforcement. Individual programs might have been deactivated on paper, but their capabilities live on inside the platforms of vendors like Palantir. At the same time, ICE is expanding its reach into continuous, real-time surveillance of individuals’ online lives. Addressing these risks requires strong safeguards: independent audits, clear public reporting on vendor systems, and robust Congressional oversight to ensure accountability.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-impact-ice-ai-platforms.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 01:00:53.248664

Learn What It Means for the Community.

A Harris County judge this week rejected a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that sought to shut down a local program allocating public funds to help undocumented immigrants access legal services. The ruling represents a key endorsement of a Houston-initiated initiative that has undergone intense political scrutiny at the state level.

The program in question, known as the Immigrant Legal Services Fund, was created in 2020 and recently received an additional $1.3 million to continue operating. The resources are distributed among nonprofit organizations that provide legal representation to people facing deportation proceedings, especially in a context of increasing federal enforcement of immigration laws.

The Harris County judge approves the continuity of the program

The court decision came after the attorney general argued that the program lacks a public purpose and violates the Texas Constitution by channeling funds to private entities. The Harris County judge did not share that view and declined to block the initiative, allowing the funds to continue being distributed as approved by the local government.

For Harris County authorities, the ruling confirms that the program serves a legitimate public function by ensuring access to due process for residents who live and work in the Houston metropolitan area.

A program that emerged in response to a local need

When the Immigrant Legal Services Fund was first approved, Harris County became the last of Texas’s large urban counties to implement such an initiative. Cities like Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio already had similar programs focused on facilitating legal counsel in immigration proceedings.

The proposal was introduced during the tenure of Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and received support from the Commissioners Court in a party-line vote. The main objective was to reduce disparities in deportation case outcomes, especially for people without legal representation.

Houston, the epicenter of immigration enforcement in Texas

The local context is key to understanding the program’s relevance. Harris County, where Houston is located, leads nationally in the number of immigration detentions requested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through local jails.

The rise in immigration operations and detentions has increased the demand for legal services, particularly for families with work and community ties in Houston. Local authorities have noted that ensuring access to legal representation not only impacts individual cases but also contributes to the region’s social and economic stability.

More: 200 laptops distributed to the community

Organizations Receiving the Funds

The program’s resources are channeled to five organizations operating in the Houston metropolitan area and surrounding regions, all with experience in immigration legal advocacy. These entities work directly with people who are detained or subpoenaed to immigration hearings, helping them understand their rights and legal options.

From the local government’s perspective, the investment aims to ensure that immigration processes are carried out with greater equity and transparency, regardless of the individual’s migration status.

Arguments by the attorney general and the political backdrop

The lawsuit is part of a series of legal actions spearheaded by the attorney general against local governments that allocate funds to controversial social programs. In this case, Paxton argued that the program does not benefit the general public but rather specific individuals, and therefore should not be funded with county money.

However, Harris County leaders have responded that the lawsuit ignores the program’s collective impact, especially in a region as diverse as Houston, where a significant portion of the workforce consists of immigrants.

Additionally, local officials have noted that the litigation comes at a time of high political tension, in which immigration policies have become a central axis of state and federal campaigns.

The role of the Harris County judge in local politics

Although the Harris County judge is not directly part of the judicial process, her administration has been pivotal in creating and defending the program. Lina Hidalgo previously announced she would not seek re-election, adding a political transition element to the debate about the future of these local policies.

Nevertheless, the court decision strengthens the county’s position against potential future attempts to curb similar programs, establishing an important precedent for Houston and other local governments in Texas.

What’s next for the immigration program?

With the lawsuit rejected, the Immigrant Legal Services Fund will continue operating under the current framework. Harris County authorities have reiterated that they will continue defending initiatives that, in their view, strengthen community cohesion and access to justice.

Meanwhile, the case highlights the contrast between the priorities of state government and the decisions made at the local level in Houston, where the focus has been on meeting the immediate needs of a diverse and growing population.

For many residents of the metropolitan area, the Harris County judge’s ruling represents relief and a signal that local programs can be sustained even amid external political pressures.",https://www.iowaparkleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Judge-Rejects-Texas-Attorney-Generals-Lawsuit-Against-Harris-County-Immigration.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 01:01:01.532951

Video on Monday in a Minneapolis neighborhood showed people yelling at ICE agents to release the woman, saying she was pregnant and could not breathe.

An agent was captured on video kneeling on the woman's back before later dragging her through the snow by one arm on her back toward a vehicle.

""Let her go! Let her go!"" witnesses yelled as the agent dragged the woman at an intersection.

The woman was eventually released from the agent's grasp.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at a news conference on Tuesday that local police were called to the scene by a federal agent who claimed officers needed help.

But when police arrived, there was no violence against federal officers, O’Hara said, adding that other law enforcement agencies may have been using ""questionable methods.""

""Once it was determined that the scene was safe and there was no violence occurring, our officers disengaged from the scene,"" O’Hara said.

""We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation,"" he continued. ""But unfortunately, that is not, that is often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city.""

O’Hara also said in a statement to Reuters that the footage of the woman dragged through the street is ""profoundly disturbing.""

""This egregious disregard for human dignity is appalling,"" he said. ""It is deeply concerning that there appears to be a lack of accountability from our federal partners.""

The woman who filmed the incident, Lauryn Spencer, was driving on her lunch break when she heard whistles and honking, which have been used to warn of ICE agents in the area.

Spencer said she approached the scene and began recording immediately, but was shoved back by an agent when she attempted to ask the woman being dragged what her name was. Spencer said she and other onlookers were also sprayed with chemical irritants.

""They were being very aggressive from the beginning, like there was never a time where they attempted to use diplomacy,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I didn’t see anybody throw any hard items. The snowballs were definitely being thrown, but we didn’t start throwing snowballs until they started dragging her around by her wrist.""

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin purported that federal agents were targeting a vehicle when protesters ""threw rocks, chunks of ice, assaulted officers and used pepper spray."" She said two people were charged with assaulting federal officers and remain in custody and that the agents sustained injuries, including cuts.

McLaughlin further alleged that agents attempted to arrest the woman in the video because she ""rushed an ICE vehicle and attempted to vandalize it"" but that they abandoned the arrest after being swarmed by protesters.

Footage showed ICE agents shattering a window before detaining a male driver, according to CBS News Minnesota. A short time later, the agents detained the woman who was seen being dragged in the video.

Agents were also seen fending off protesters who threw snowballs at them. The agents used chemical irritants, and one used a taser before yelling at the crowd: ""Who wants more?""

Tensions have been escalating in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as federal authorities continue an immigration crackdown as part of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

Former Minnesota state legislator Hodan Hassan said she believes ICE tactics are becoming more harsh as the immigration enforcement operation in the region continues.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Carlos Montes was driving with his family on South Greeley Highway on Nov. 26 when a Laramie County Sheriff’s deputy pulled him over for what first appeared like a routine traffic stop.

Instead, the deputy took Montes into custody as his pregnant partner and 5-year-old son watched helplessly, his friends say.

For three weeks, his family and friends were desperate to find answers, including where the expectant father was being held. They say they were met with silence, conflicting reports and overall confusion when dealing with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Montes is a barber at Drew’s Barbershop in Cheyenne, according to husband-and-wife shop owners Drew Weston and Andrea Shipley. The couple is leading the effort to help his family navigate an increasingly difficult situation. They maintain he was wrongly detained by immigration officials despite trying to methodically follow the process to work legally in the U.S. Once he was taken by ICE, his friends and family describe how a distressing process left them in the dark about his whereabouts and well-being while putting up barriers to even simple steps like sending money to him to pay for phone calls.

Originally from Nicaragua, Montes and his partner had been living in Cheyenne since 2023, Shipley said. (His partner did not want to comment for this story.) As a licensed barber, he started working at Drew’s Barbershop in April of this year and had already gone through the proper immigration and licensing process, she said.

“Carlos has a naturalization number, and all of those things were approved through the state of Wyoming with the Attorney General’s office,” she said. “He’s worked at four different shops in town; he’s well known.”

After Montes disappeared into ICE custody last month, the couple encountered an immigration process that has been confusing and hard to navigate, Shipley said, adding, “Communication can be really difficult.”

That’s left the couple trying to piece together what happened to the barber. Weston theorized that some piece of paperwork might have been lost or missed in the long process. There’s also a chance that Montes entered the United States when migrants from Nicaragua were offered temporary protected status. The Trump administration terminated that status for Nicaraguans in September.

“I know that he has done so much paperwork to even be here and get his license, that he’s a guy who will do what he needs to do the legal way,” Weston said, “so for this to pop up and then to be treated like this, oh my God.”

After numerous requests for comment, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to Oil City News on Dec. 9 with an email stating: “Carlos Fausto Montes Calderon is an illegal alien from Nicaragua. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge June 6, 2024. He was arrested by ICE Denver Nov. 26, 2025 and removed to Nicaragua on Dec. 4.”

That was information Montes’s distraught family and friends said they were unable to get from ICE. Then on Monday, after weeks of silence, the family finally heard from Montes. He had been deported back to Nicaragua and was able to connect with family there.

“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE,” said Jackson-based immigration attorney Elisabeth Trefonas.

Although Trefonas isn’t representing Montes, she told Oil City News that his circumstances are familiar. It’s also not uncommon for people to have removal orders filed even though they believe their immigration papers are in order, she said.

The arrest

Montes was with his partner and child in the car when a sheriff’s deputy stopped the family, according to Shipley.

“She is going to have a baby any day,” Shipley said. “It’s heartbreaking what is happening.”

At first, the barbershop owners believed Montes had been sent to the ICE holding facility in Aurora, Colorado. But dozens of attempts to reach him were futile, they said.

Oil City News attempted multiple times to reach the privately-run Aurora Detention Center through its published number, which rang but was not answered.

Weston said a family member got through to the facility, but was unable to talk to Montes, even after putting money on his account for phone calls. Families of detainees have described the need to pay for phone calls and FaceTime to communicate with detainees.

In an attempt to see Montes, a family member traveled to the Colorado facility on Dec. 2 for a visitation, but was told that he may have already been deported. Two days later, a family member was able to reach Montes and confirm that he was still in the United States but had been sent to an ICE facility in a different state. On Dec. 5, the family used an online ICE locator tool that showed he was being held in CoreCivic’s Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi. Montes’s information was later missing from the locator tool when the family and Oil City News tried again. Four days after the locator tool indicated he was in Mississippi, ICE responded to Oil City News with the email saying Montes had already been deported on Dec. 4.

According to Shipley, Montes had told a family member that he had “signed some paperwork,” but wasn’t sure about the document’s meaning.

A spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said a representative had been in contact with the family, but was not directly involved and could only offer advice.

The Laramie County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that their deputies made the initial traffic stop that night for an inoperable headlight. “ICE authorized deputies to take Montes into custody,” a spokesperson said.

Montes has been stopped by law enforcement before. Last fall, he was pulled over three times and issued citations for traffic violations, court documents show. Most of the citations were for improper registration, not having a valid driver’s license and not possessing insurance. Otherwise, Oil City News did not locate a criminal history for Montes.

Trefonas, the Jackson-based attorney, cautioned that it’s risky for people to be driving if they have uncertainty about their immigration status, “but I’ve also had U.S. citizens wrongfully detained as well with mistaken identities, particularly with common last names.”

After being swiftly transported to a facility, she described, it’s possible the detainee either didn’t have a phone number memorized or didn’t have an opportunity to call anyone. “And then they’re moved or removed from the country before there was any time to talk with them about it,” she said.

Montes does not have an immigration attorney, according to Shipley. Immigration attorneys interviewed by WyoFile recently said the confusing process of detaining, moving and eventually possibly deporting migrants to different countries has become typical as the Trump administration increases its deportation efforts.

“We’re seeing people moved around so much they lose track of what day it is … they don’t know time and place,” Laura Lunn, of the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, told WyoFile. “People [end up] detained in Aurora, Colorado, and don’t know there’s a giant mountain range outside their front door.”

Shipley and Weston have been posting updates on the Drew’s Barbershop Facebook page, trying to rally community support for Montes, and established a GoFundMe fundraiser to offer financial help for his family and to possibly hire an attorney. Shipley said they are determined to help bring him back to Cheyenne to be with his family.

Aside from the personal cost, the couple said the aggressive crackdowns have taken a toll on small businesses, including theirs.

“It’s not about the money, it’s about the humanity,” Shipley added. “We’re taking a big hit and other small businesses affected by this are taking huge hits, too, but the fact is the people in the barbershop are losing a colleague, they’re losing a trusted friend and part of the culture of the barbershop, a community watering hole where people are supposed to be safe.”

The man’s name was Nenko Gantchev, a Bulgarian citizen arrested in Chicago, according to the information provided to the committee by ICE.

Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security panel, said in a statement he was ""disturbed"" by the reported death at ICE facility near Baldwin in rural Lake County.

""People in the custody of the U.S. government must be treated humanely and have access to lifesaving medical care. While the cause of this death in Michigan is still under investigation, I have requested a formal briefing from ICE officials,"" Peters said.

Through the end of September, there had been 16 deaths this year in adult immigration detention in the U.S., according to tracking by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The North Lake Processing Center, a former privately-run prison, reopened in mid-June to house ICE detainees with a capacity of about 1,800. It’s owned and operated by GEO Group, a private company.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.

With some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel."" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.

Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations ""the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”

The Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”

A tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.

Woodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.

Attempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.

A spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.

The ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.

Sole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.

Tribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.

“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.

Sharon Keegan

I. Introduction

In United States v. Sharon Elizabeth Keegan, No. 22‑13019 (11th Cir. Dec. 17, 2025), the Eleventh Circuit confronted a recurring but under‑theorized evidentiary problem: when can a party use an examining psychologist or physician as a conduit to introduce that party’s own out‑of‑court narrative under the hearsay exception for statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4)?

Keegan was charged with producing child pornography involving her fourteen‑year‑old sister, among other offenses. Her defense centered on duress: she claimed that her husband, the co‑defendant, had severely abused her and that this abuse vitiated her mens rea. Rather than testify and face cross‑examination, Keegan attempted to tell her story through an expert psychologist, Dr. Victoria Reynolds, to whom she related detailed allegations of spousal abuse. She sought to admit those statements through Rule 803(4) on the theory that they were “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment.”

The district court allowed Dr. Reynolds to testify as an expert about Keegan’s psychological condition, but excluded Keegan’s detailed abuse allegations as hearsay not covered by Rule 803(4), and alternatively under Rule 403. Keegan entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving her right to appeal the exclusion of the statements. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that statements made to a physician retained principally for litigation, and not for the patient’s own medical care, are not “for” medical diagnosis or treatment within the meaning of Rule 803(4).

In doing so, the court:

Gave a purpose‑based, intent‑focused reading to the word “for” in Rule 803(4);

Re‑anchored the medical‑treatment exception in its traditional “selfish treatment motivation” rationale and in reliability concerns common to the hearsay exceptions;

Explicitly declined to follow the expansive reading of the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4), relying instead on the rule’s text and the later amendment to Rule 703; and

Created a clear split with earlier decisions from the Second, Fourth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits that had broadly admitted statements to litigation‑only experts under Rule 803(4).

This commentary analyzes the opinion’s reasoning, its treatment of precedents and Advisory Committee Notes, and its likely impact on the law of hearsay, expert testimony, and criminal defense strategy in the Eleventh Circuit and beyond.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Factual Background and Trial Posture

In 2019, Keegan took nude photographs and videos of her fourteen‑year‑old sister and uploaded them to a shared Dropbox account so that her husband could view them—sometimes at his request, sometimes as a “surprise.” An undercover U.K. agent discovered some of these images online, which led to a U.S. investigation, search warrants, and charges against Keegan’s husband. Initially, law enforcement did not suspect Keegan, but her own statements to investigators (admitting she had “accidentally sent maybe four or five photos” of her sister in pink panties) and forensic analysis of her phone uncovered substantial incriminating material.

Both Keegan and her husband were charged with child pornography offenses. The husband pleaded guilty. Keegan pursued a duress‑type theory: she contended she lacked the requisite mens rea because she was acting under the coercive control and abuse of her husband.

Years earlier, in 2018, a hospital physician had diagnosed Keegan with a dissociative disorder. After indictment, Keegan’s counsel retained Dr. Victoria Reynolds, a psychologist who had spent the last decade exclusively as a full‑time expert witness, with no clinical practice. Counsel asked Reynolds to “evaluate the impacts” of Keegan’s alleged abuse “as they relate to her current legal charges.” After two days of interviews, Reynolds arrived at the same dissociative diagnosis and prepared to testify that Keegan’s conduct was the product of “complex and recognizable trauma‑driven adaptations and survival strategies.” Central to that narrative were Keegan’s own detailed descriptions of spousal abuse, which Reynolds intended to recount to the jury.

The government initially moved to exclude Reynolds’s testimony as irrelevant. The district court denied that broad motion, finding the proposed expert opinion probative of the defense. The government then renewed its challenge, this time focusing narrowly on Keegan’s statements to Reynolds describing her husband’s abuse. The government argued that these statements were hearsay not within Rule 803(4), though they could be referenced as the basis of the expert’s opinion under Rule 703. The district court agreed:

Factually, it found that Keegan’s purpose in speaking with Reynolds was to prepare the psychologist to testify—“to feed [Reynolds] her story in hopes that [the] witness would then be able to tell the same story to the jury”—rather than to obtain diagnosis or treatment.

Legally, it held that Rule 803(4) did not apply, and in the alternative, that Rule 403 barred the statements because their slight probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to the government.

Keegan then entered a conditional guilty plea to one count of child pornography production, reserving the right to withdraw the plea if she prevailed on appeal of the evidentiary ruling. On appeal, she argued that:

The district court misinterpreted Rule 803(4) by imposing an unduly narrow, purpose‑based limitation; and

Even if 803(4) was correctly construed, the court erred in excluding the statements under Rule 403.

B. Holding

The Eleventh Circuit (Judge Grant, joined by Judges Newsom and Abudu; Newsom wrote a concurrence) affirmed. The court held:

Rule 803(4) covers only statements that are actually made “for” medical diagnosis or treatment, i.e., where the patient’s purpose is to obtain medical care or evaluation for her own health, not to create evidence for litigation;

Reliability and “selfish treatment motivation” are inherent in Rule 803(4)’s design and must inform its application, even though the rule does not explicitly mention “trustworthiness” as some other Rule 803 exceptions do;

The district court did not clearly err in finding that Keegan’s statements to Reynolds about spousal abuse were not made for diagnosis or treatment but for use in litigation, and therefore did not abuse its discretion in excluding them as hearsay; and

Given that conclusion, the court found it unnecessary to reach the alternative Rule 403 ruling.

In a concurrence, Judge Newsom agreed with the result and reasoning but emphasized an interpretive nuance: even if Keegan’s reading of “for” as permitting dual motives is linguistically plausible, proper textual interpretation must be informed by the broader context and structure of the hearsay rules. In that context, the phrase “made for . . . medical diagnosis” cannot reasonably be read to include statements made for diagnosis that was itself sought as a tool for litigation strategy.

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Precedents and Authorities Cited

1. Historical Background on Hearsay

The majority opinion begins with a historical survey of hearsay doctrine, drawing on classic sources:

Wigmore on Evidence (5th & 6th volumes): The court cites Wigmore’s account of the gradual emergence of a general rule against hearsay from the 1500s through the 1700s, and his discussions of the rationale for exceptions when statements are “practically sufficient” in reliability.

Queen v. Hepburn, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 290 (1813) (Marshall, C.J.): Cited for the “intrinsic weakness” of hearsay and its “incompetency to satisfy the mind” of factfinders about facts.

Ellicott v. Pearl, 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 412 (1836) (Story, J.): Quoted for describing hearsay as “exceedingly infirm, unsatisfactory and intrinsically weak.”

Coleman v. Southwick, 9 Johns. 45 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1812): Emphasizes that hearsay deprives the opposing party of the opportunity for cross‑examination, and that a hearsay declarant can hide behind “I was told so” without answering particulars or resolving contradictions.

State v. Medlicott, 9 Kan. 257 (1872): Invoked to emphasize that rules excluding hearsay are designed to guard against the dangers of unsworn, untested declarations.

These authorities serve several purposes:

They re‑center the analysis on the fundamental concern with cross‑examination and reliability;

They link modern Rule 803(4) to a long tradition of cabining exceptions strictly to situations with strong guarantees of trustworthiness; and

They ground the court’s skepticism toward litigation‑oriented medical statements in a historical distrust of hearsay designed to evade cross‑examination.

2. Modern Hearsay Doctrine and Exceptions

The court references several modern authorities to situate Rule 803(4) within the broader scheme of hearsay exceptions:

Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), 802, 803, 807: The court restates the basic definition of hearsay as an out‑of‑court statement offered for its truth and notes the general rule of inadmissibility in Rule 802, followed by enumerated exceptions (Rule 803) and the residual exception (Rule 807), which explicitly requires “sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.”

Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237 (1895): Quoted regarding the rationale for dying declarations—impending death is presumed to induce truthfulness.

White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346 (1992): Cited to classify statements made for medical treatment as among the nation’s “firmly rooted” hearsay exceptions and to emphasize that some exceptions, such as medical statements and excited utterances, are inherently reliable even without explicit trustworthiness language.

Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990): Cited for the proposition that patients are “highly unlikely to lie” to their doctors because treatment effectiveness depends on accurate information.

Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109 (1943): Used to contrast inherently trustworthy business records with those created primarily for litigation, and to show that explicit trustworthiness language was necessary in Rule 803(6) because not all business records are inherently reliable.

United States v. Williams, 865 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 2017): Provides the abuse‑of‑discretion standard for evidentiary rulings and the rule that legal errors in such rulings are per se abuses of discretion.

City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., 158 F.3d 548 (11th Cir. 1998); United States v. Byrom, 910 F.2d 725 (11th Cir. 1990): Establish clear‑error review for factual findings underlying evidentiary rulings.

3. Treatise Authorities on Rule 803(4)

The court relies heavily on leading evidence treatises:

McCormick on Evidence § 277: Provides the key phrase “selfish treatment motivation,” which the court adopts. The idea is that patients are motivated to be truthful when speaking to medical providers because their own health is at stake.

Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 803.06[1]: Describes the “guarantee of credibility” that arises when a patient’s desire to heal encourages accurate statements to a physician.

Wigmore on Evidence § 1720: Warns against admitting patient statements whose “real use and predominating effect would be that of hearsay testimony of the patient,” a warning the court uses to justify limiting Rule 803(4) to genuine medical‑care statements.

4. Rule 703 and Basis‑of‑Opinion Evidence

Crucially, the court invokes the 2000 amendment to Rule 703 and the scholarship surrounding it:

Fed. R. Evid. 703: Post‑2000, it clarifies that inadmissible facts or data reasonably relied upon by an expert may be disclosed to the jury only “to help the jury evaluate the opinion” and, if they would otherwise be inadmissible, only if their probative value in evaluating the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.

Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., 72 F.4th 1237 (11th Cir. 2023): Cited for the proposition that hearsay relied on by an expert under Rule 703 is admissible only as the basis of the expert’s opinion, not as substantive evidence.

United States v. Kent, 93 F.4th 1213 (11th Cir. 2024): Referenced for distinguishing between using a statement as substantive evidence versus as the basis of an expert’s opinion.

Paul W. Kaufman & Christopher J. Merken, “Toward a Presumptive Admission of Medical Records Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4),” 64 B.C. L. Rev. 567 (2023): The court quotes this article for the insight that Rule 703 now demands the very jury distinction (between basis and substantive use) that the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4) disparaged as unrealistic.

Ronald L. Carlson & Paul R. Rice articles on expert testimony: Cited in the Rule 703 advisory history to highlight the debate over whether juries can meaningfully distinguish an expert’s opinion from its factual bases.

5. Circuit Precedents on Rule 803(4) from Other Circuits

The court explicitly declines to follow older cases from other circuits that broadly applied Rule 803(4) to litigation‑only examinations:

O’Gee v. Dobbs Houses, Inc., 570 F.2d 1084 (2d Cir. 1978);

United States v. Iron Shell, 633 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1980);

Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941 (4th Cir. 1988);

United States v. Farley, 992 F.2d 1122 (10th Cir. 1993).

These decisions, relying heavily on the 1972 Advisory Committee Note, treated Rule 803(4) as having abolished “the common‑law distinction between the doctor who is consulted for the purpose of treatment and an examination for the purpose of diagnosis only,” and allowed statements to litigation‑oriented experts to come in as substantive evidence.

The Eleventh Circuit respectfully parts ways with these decisions, emphasizing that:

They predate the 2000 amendment to Rule 703;

They do not seriously engage the text and purpose of Rule 803(4); and

They give too much weight to the 1972 Note, which the Eleventh Circuit views as both atextual and undermined by subsequent rule amendments.

6. Deference to District Courts

The opinion stresses the role of trial judges in evaluating purpose and context:

United States v. Shamsid‑Deen, 61 F.4th 935 (11th Cir. 2023): Cited for the proposition that district courts, “immersed in the case as it unfolds,” are well positioned to resolve evidentiary questions based on procedural and factual detail.

B. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

1. Textual Focus on “for” in Rule 803(4)

Rule 803(4) provides, in relevant part, that the following is not excluded by the rule against hearsay:

“A statement that: (A) is made for—and is reasonably pertinent to—medical diagnosis or treatment; and (B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause.”

The core interpretive question is the meaning of “made for . . . medical diagnosis or treatment.” Starting with ordinary dictionary definitions, the court finds that “for” denotes “the object, aim, or purpose of an action or activity,” and “connotes intent.” Thus, for a statement to be within Rule 803(4), obtaining a medical diagnosis or treatment must be the declarant’s purpose or aim in making the statement.

Importantly:

This focus is on the declarant’s purpose, not merely the fact that a medical professional was involved or that a diagnosis resulted.

The court emphasizes the link between purpose (“for”) and the functional justification of the exception—reliability founded on a “selfish treatment motivation.”

2. Reliability and the “Selfish Treatment Motivation”

The opinion re‑situates Rule 803(4) within the broader logic of the hearsay exceptions. The key steps in the court’s reasoning are:

Hearsay exceptions are justified by reliability. The court draws on Wigmore and Supreme Court cases like White and Wright to assert that hearsay exceptions admit statements made in contexts that provide “substantial guarantees of . . . trustworthiness.”

Rule 803(4) is premised on a patient’s incentive to tell the truth when seeking care. The patient’s desire to obtain effective medical diagnosis or treatment—what McCormick calls “selfish treatment motivation”—is what ensures reliability.

Statements to litigation‑only experts may lack that reliability. When a party consults a doctor or psychologist solely (or essentially) to prepare for litigation, the natural incentive is not necessarily to be candid for health reasons, but to craft a narrative advantageous in court.

Although Rule 803(4) lacks an explicit “trustworthiness” clause (unlike Rules 803(6) and 803(8)), the court reasons that reliability is no less central:

In contexts such as excited utterances (Rule 803(2)), reliability is inherent in the circumstances of the statement, and thus need not be expressly referenced.

For medical diagnosis/treatment statements, the guarantee of credibility is likewise built in when the statement is truly made to seek care, but not when the doctor is effectively a litigation consultant.

3. Limiting the Advisory Committee’s 1972 Note

A key doctrinal move is the court’s treatment of the 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(4). The Note had asserted that:

Statements to a doctor “consulted only for the purpose of enabling him to testify” are admissible under Rule 803(4);

This breaks from “conventional doctrine,” under which such statements were not admissible as substantive evidence but could be referenced to explain the basis of the expert’s opinion; and

The reason for this break was skepticism that juries could maintain a distinction between basis‑of‑opinion use and substantive truth.

The Eleventh Circuit declines to follow this Note, for two reasons:

Notes are not binding and can be outdated. While Advisory Committee Notes are usually entitled to “great weight,” they are not law and may be discounted when later developments undermine their rationale.

The Note’s central assumption has been repudiated by the 2000 amendment to Rule 703. Rule 703 now explicitly requires juries to distinguish between inadmissible information used only as the basis of an expert’s opinion and information that is admissible as substantive evidence. In other words, the Rule now demands exactly the jury distinction that the 1972 Note to Rule 803(4) declared unrealistic.

Given this mismatch, the court concludes that the Note’s rationale and its broad endorsement of admitting statements to litigation‑only physicians as substantive evidence should not control contemporary interpretation of Rule 803(4). Instead, courts must return to the text of the rule and its underlying reliability rationale.

4. Interplay with Rule 703: Basis vs. Substantive Evidence

The opinion carefully separates two distinct questions:

Can the expert rely on the statements? Yes. Under Rule 703, an expert may base her opinion on inadmissible hearsay if experts in the field reasonably rely on such information. The government conceded that Reynolds could rely on Keegan’s statements as part of the basis for her diagnosis.

Can the statements themselves be admitted as substantive evidence for their truth? Not necessarily. That requires a hearsay exception (such as Rule 803(4)), or another independent ground of admissibility.

This distinction is crucial in practice. Under the Eleventh Circuit’s approach:

The expert may testify that she diagnosed Keegan with a dissociative disorder and may explain that she relied on Keegan’s descriptions of past abuse as part of the basis for that diagnosis (subject to appropriate limiting instructions under Rule 703).

The jury may not, however, treat Keegan’s out‑of‑court abuse narrative, as recounted by Reynolds, as independent proof that the abuse occurred, unless a hearsay exception like Rule 803(4) applies.

By insisting on this separation, the court prevents parties from “end‑running” the hearsay rules by converting their own narratives into admissible “medical statements” simply by reciting them to a hired expert witness.

5. Application to Keegan’s Statements

The court applies its interpretation of Rule 803(4) to the facts with a strong dose of deference to the district court’s factual findings:

Timing: Keegan consulted Reynolds only after indictment and after spending four months in jail—suggesting a litigation‑driven motive, not ongoing clinical care.

Retainer Letter: Defense counsel explicitly requested that Reynolds evaluate the impact of alleged abuse “as they relate to [Keegan’s] current legal charges,” focusing the engagement on litigation rather than treatment.

Expert’s Role: Reynolds had spent a decade as a full‑time expert witness without doing clinical work, reinforcing that her function was forensic, not therapeutic.

Prior Diagnosis: Keegan had already received the same diagnosis (dissociative disorder) from a hospital physician years earlier—without sharing allegations of spousal abuse. If her goal was merely to inform the jury she had such a diagnosis, her existing medical record would have sufficed; she did not need a new diagnosis predicated on a more elaborate narrative of abuse.

From these facts, the district court inferred—and the Eleventh Circuit found no clear error in the inference—that Keegan’s primary (indeed exclusive) purpose in making the statements to Reynolds was to prepare a trial narrative, not to seek medical diagnosis or treatment for her own health. As the opinion puts it, “the medical diagnosis was not ‘the object, aim, or purpose’” of Keegan’s statements.

Thus, the statements were not made “for” medical diagnosis or treatment as required by Rule 803(4), and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding them as inadmissible hearsay.

6. The Concurring Opinion: Textualism in Context vs. Literalism

Judge Newsom’s concurrence focuses on interpretive method. He acknowledges that, taken in isolation, Keegan’s argument has textual plausibility: a person can do something “for” more than one reason, and she did want a diagnosis (even if also for litigation). On a purely semantic level, Rule 803(4) does not expressly exclude dual‑purpose statements.

However, he distinguishes between:

“Sterile semantics”—what might be linguistically possible in a decontextualized setting; and

“Proper textualism”—which seeks the ordinary meaning of the phrase “made for . . . medical diagnosis” as used in the real‑world context of a set of hearsay rules designed to admit only reliably trustworthy statements.

In that context, he argues, no reasonable reader would understand Rule 803(4) to cover a statement made to obtain a medical diagnosis that was itself sought with an eye toward litigation and not for its own therapeutic value. Because such statements do not carry the presumption of reliability that undergirds the hearsay exceptions, they fall outside the ordinary meaning of the rule, properly understood.

The concurrence thus reinforces the majority’s bottom line but underscores that good textual interpretation must incorporate context, manifest purpose, and structure—not just dictionary definitions.

C. Impact and Implications

1. Narrowing Rule 803(4) in the Eleventh Circuit

Within the Eleventh Circuit (Alabama, Florida, Georgia), Keegan significantly narrows the circumstances in which statements to medical professionals—especially forensic or litigation‑consulting experts—can be admitted under Rule 803(4). Key practical consequences include:

Purpose inquiry is now central. Litigants seeking to invoke Rule 803(4) must be prepared to show that the declarant’s purpose in making the statement was to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment, not merely to bolster a litigation position.

Engagement letters and timing will be scrutinized. Courts will look to when and why the expert was retained, the expert’s practice (clinical vs. purely forensic), and whether the same diagnosis or treatment could have been (or was) obtained in a non‑litigation setting.

Defendants cannot insulate themselves from cross‑examination by “laundering” their narrative through experts. Attempts to substitute an expert’s repetition of a defendant’s story for the defendant’s own testimony now face heightened skepticism under 803(4).

2. A Circuit Split and Potential for Supreme Court or Rulemaking Intervention

By explicitly declining to follow O’Gee, Iron Shell, Morgan, and Farley, the Eleventh Circuit has staked out a conflicting approach on the admissibility of statements made to doctors retained solely for trial. While those older cases are decades old and may be ripe for reconsideration in light of the 2000 amendment to Rule 703, they remain good law in their respective circuits unless and until overruled.

This divergence:

Creates a doctrinal split over the scope of Rule 803(4);

Raises the prospect that the Supreme Court could eventually resolve the question; and

May spur the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules to consider updating the text of Rule 803(4) or revising its 1972 Note to reflect current doctrine and Rule 703’s framework.

3. Effects on Criminal Defense and Prosecution Strategies

The decision has clear implications for both sides in criminal cases:

For defendants:

Using expert witnesses to convey their own narratives without testifying themselves will be harder. Courts will examine whether post‑indictment consultations with experts are truly medical or primarily forensic.

Defendants with existing clinical diagnoses (e.g., from hospital or treating physicians) may be more inclined to rely on those records and treating providers, who can more readily satisfy the “selfish treatment motivation” criterion.

Defense counsel will need to think more carefully about whether and how to instruct experts to recount the defendant’s statements, and whether such evidence can be admitted under Rule 703 (with limiting instructions) rather than Rule 803(4).

For prosecutors:

They can invoke Keegan to challenge defense efforts to introduce elaborate backstory narratives (e.g., abuse, coercion) through retained experts as substantive evidence rather than as mere basis‑of‑opinion material.

However, the same logic may boomerang against prosecution‑retained experts or forensic interviewers in cases involving child victims, domestic violence, or sexual assault, where the line between treatment and litigation preparation is sometimes blurred.

4. Implications for Victim and Child‑Witness Statements

Although Keegan is a defendant‑focused case, its logic is neutral and applies equally to prosecution‑sponsored experts. In some jurisdictions, statements made by child victims of abuse to “forensic interviewers” or SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurses are admitted under Rule 803(4) on the theory that they are reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.

Under Keegan’s framework, courts in the Eleventh Circuit may need to:

Examine whether the primary purpose of such examinations is medical (e.g., assessing and treating trauma, physical injuries, or mental health) or evidentiary (collecting statements for prosecution);

Distinguish between portions of the interviews necessary for diagnosis/treatment and those that are primarily investigative or forensic; and

Consider whether parts of such interviews might be admissible only under Rule 703 (as basis‑of‑opinion material) rather than under Rule 803(4) as substantive proof.

While the opinion does not directly address Confrontation Clause issues, the narrowing of Rule 803(4) may indirectly affect the range of out‑of‑court statements that can be admitted consistency with both the hearsay rules and the Sixth Amendment.

5. Strengthening the Basis/Substance Divide in Expert Testimony

Keegan reinforces a trend toward enforcing the distinction between:

What an expert may rely on in forming an opinion (Rule 703); and

What the jury may consider as independent proof of facts (hearsay rules like Rule 803(4)).

By rejecting the 1972 Note’s skepticism about jurors’ ability to keep these concepts separate, the Eleventh Circuit aligns with Rule 703’s post‑2000 architecture and supports the use of careful limiting instructions:

Juries may hear that “the expert considered X” without treating X as fact unless a separate hearsay exception validates X as substantive evidence.

This distinction constrains the risk that experts will be used as vehicles for introducing large volumes of otherwise inadmissible hearsay under the guise of explaining “bases” of opinions.

IV. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Hearsay and Why It Is Disfavored

Hearsay is an out‑of‑court statement offered in court to prove that what it says is true. For example, if a witness testifies, “My neighbor told me she saw Bill start the fire,” that is hearsay if offered to prove Bill started the fire, because the neighbor is not in court to be cross‑examined.

Hearsay is generally excluded because:

The original speaker is not under oath;

The opponent cannot cross‑examine the original speaker;

The jury cannot observe the original speaker’s demeanor; and

Memories can be faulty, statements can be taken out of context, or motives can be suspect.

However, some hearsay is admitted under carefully defined exceptions where circumstances indicate a high level of reliability—for example, dying declarations, present‑sense impressions, and statements for medical diagnosis or treatment.

B. Rule 803(4): Statements for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment

Rule 803(4) allows hearsay statements that:

Are made for medical diagnosis or treatment (i.e., with the purpose of getting medical help or evaluation), and

Describe medical history, symptoms, or the general cause of the condition.

The underlying idea is that people will usually tell the truth to doctors because their health depends on it. This self‑interest in getting proper care makes the statements more reliable than typical hearsay.

Keegan clarifies that this exception does not apply when:

The person is talking to a doctor or psychologist primarily to prepare testimony for a lawsuit or criminal trial, and

Any “diagnosis” obtained is really a tool for litigation rather than for medical care.

C. Rule 703: Expert Opinions and Their Bases

Rule 703 governs what experts (such as doctors, psychologists, engineers) may rely on to form their opinions and what they may tell the jury about those bases. Experts can rely on information that would not itself be admissible—like hearsay—as long as experts in the field reasonably rely on such information.

But there is an important distinction:

Expert reliance: The expert may consider hearsay in forming an opinion.

Substantive use: The jury cannot automatically treat that hearsay as independent proof of the facts stated unless a hearsay exception applies.

After the 2000 amendments, Rule 703 expects juries to understand this difference, often with help from limiting instructions. Keegan leans on this structure to say: you cannot simply bypass the hearsay rules by putting your story into a medical expert’s mouth.

D. Duress and Mens Rea (Briefly)

Keegan’s defense theory was that she lacked the necessary mens rea (criminal intent) because her husband’s abuse placed her under duress. Roughly speaking:

Mens rea refers to the state of mind required for a crime (e.g., intentionally, knowingly, recklessly).

Duress is a defense arguing that a defendant committed a crime because of unlawful threats or coercion, such that the law should excuse or mitigate the conduct.

Her abuse narrative was therefore central to the case. The evidentiary question was not whether she could present any evidence related to mental health or abuse, but whether she could do so via her own hearsay statements filtered through an expert and protected from cross‑examination.

V. Conclusion

United States v. Keegan establishes an important and carefully reasoned limitation on the medical‑treatment hearsay exception in Rule 803(4) within the Eleventh Circuit. The key takeaways are:

Purpose matters. Statements to medical professionals are admissible under Rule 803(4) only when made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment—rooted in the patient’s “selfish treatment motivation”—and not when made primarily (or solely) to generate evidence for litigation.

Reliability remains central. Even where the rule text does not mention “trustworthiness,” the hearsay exceptions are anchored in reliability concerns that must inform how courts apply terms like “for medical diagnosis or treatment.”

Advisory Notes are subordinate to text and later amendments.

A circuit split emerges. By rejecting the broader, Note‑driven approach of several other circuits, the Eleventh Circuit has created a divergence that may invite reconsideration by those circuits, intervention by the Supreme Court, or revision of the rules or Advisory Committee Notes.

Two months later, the Trump administration asked Congress in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate OCDETF funding altogether.
In separate statements, the top two Republican lawmakers on subcommittees overseeing Justice Department appropriations did not criticize the move to shutter the program.
His office said his statement referred to joint task forces whose work was previously reimbursed through OCDETF, but is now being carried out through the Homeland Security Task Forces.
“The Trump Administration did not invent interagency cooperation, it has been working for decades.”","For months, there were signs that appropriators were not on board with a Trump administration plan to wipe out funding for a decades-old Justice Department program tasked with coordinating major drug-trafficking and transnational-crime investigations.

Republican-led spending proposals rejected the idea. A Senate report said eliminating the program’s appropriations account would be “infeasible” without more consultation, while a House report touted the program’s “demonstrated ability” to share information efficiently to “keep Americans safe.”

During a September markup, veteran House appropriator Harold Rogers put it this way: “Our commitment to the work of the task forces can’t be underestimated or understated.”

The Justice Department disbanded it anyway.

The fate of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces is one example of how the Trump administration has bulldozed past Congress’ appropriations power as it reorganizes the federal government to match the vision of the president, oftentimes with little to no meaningful public pushback from GOP lawmakers.

DOJ officials first ordered OCDETF resources be used for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement push, then transferred key operations and all of the program’s cases to other offices or entities, according to DOJ documents and communications with Congress.

They told Congress the program would be “eliminated” and removed from the organizational chart, those documents state. The Trump administration casts the move not as a closure, but as a reorganization that funnels the agency’s money directly to partner agencies to do investigations. The DOJ says it will save millions in “bureaucratic spending” and “ensure continued coordination and direction of high-level cases across multiple components.”

Thomas Padden, a longtime OCDETF official who served as acting director during the closure process, wrote on Substack that the changes are among those that mean America “is left more vulnerable to organized crime threats.”

The administration shifted the work into an unproven structure that places more emphasis on immigration offenses and human smuggling, wrote Padden, who left OCDETF at the end of September. The new model deprioritizes probes that include financial investigations and eliminates a central staffing infrastructure that ensured prosecutors and investigators worked together.

“I don’t understand why an effective program like OCDETF would be eliminated when we have 43 years of proven success going after the most significant organized crime and drug-trafficking threats that the nation faces,” Padden said in an interview.

The move also raises questions about congressional spending authority.

For the previous two fiscal years, Congress has directed $547 million annually to the program. That funding rate was also included in the current continuing resolution, which runs through Jan. 30.

Democrats largely opposed that stopgap measure as well as a yearlong fiscal 2025 CR that they said handed over too much spending flexibility to the Trump administration. And all year, they’ve fought White House attempts to claw back or redirect money from purposes Congress intended in appropriations law.

Cartwright (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Former Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., who previously led the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DOJ funding, said that repurposing of funds is illegal and pointed to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to freeze or claw back appropriated money without congressional approval.

“I worked with presidents from both parties and served in both majority and minority in the House for 12 years and could not imagine DOJ taking this kind of unilateral action during my tenure,” Cartwright said.

“This is an unfortunate precedent for the institution of Congress,” he said. “I am disheartened to see members of Congress allowing themselves to be taken advantage of in this way.”

History of support

Many Americans probably haven’t heard of OCDETF, pronounced “oh-suh-def,” which billed itself as “an independent component” of DOJ and “the largest anti-crime task force in the country.”

But they have probably heard of some of the tens of thousands of investigations it helped coordinate, such as efforts to take down Colombian cartels in the 1980s and violent Mexican cartels in the 1990s.

In 2019, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who DOJ dubbed as a principal leader of the Mexico-based organized crime syndicate known as the Sinaloa Cartel, was sentenced to life in prison after an OCDETF-involved investigation that included numerous law enforcement agencies.

The government said the Sinaloa Cartel was responsible for “importing and distributing more than a million kilograms of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin in the United States.”

Established under the Reagan administration in 1982 as part of President Ronald Reagan’s initiatives to respond to drug trafficking and organized crime, OCDETF had federal partners within DOJ and the departments of Homeland Security, Treasury, Labor and State, as well as the U.S. Postal Service and state and local law enforcement, according to a June 2025 Congressional Research Service report.

The program had strike forces around the U.S. to coordinate prosecutions and investigations. The OCDETF director managed the processes for identifying priority drug trafficking and organized crime threats, according to the CRS report.

Padden, the former acting director, said the Reagan administration wanted to overcome “stovepipes,” where intelligence information within one agency is not shared with others.

“These agencies had little incentive to share what they knew, and gaps between their differing authorities, and the purpose for which each agency is funded by Congress, made it challenging to conduct joint investigations of criminal networks,” Padden wrote. “These investigative challenges still exist today.”

The program’s central staffing and separate funding stream from Congress broke the stovepipes, Padden wrote, and agencies had to work together with prosecutors to build cases if they wanted to obtain the additional resources that the program provided.

In a partisan Washington, the program has received funding under both Democrat and Republican control. For years, funding has been consistent at around $550 million per year, though both chambers in their fiscal 2026 bills have proposed cuts.

The first Trump administration embraced OCDETF, and an executive order from President Donald Trump in 2017 stipulated that the program’s mission should cover various kinds of transnational organized crime — human trafficking, corruption and intellectual-property theft.

New operation

But within weeks of Trump’s second inauguration, DOJ leadership would look to OCDETF to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to crack down on immigration enforcement.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sent a memo March 6 to establish an initiative called “Operation Take Back America” that would in part use OCDETF resources to “implement core policy objectives” established by Trump.

Among those priorities, Blanche told the department the operation would require OCDETF to “surge existing resources” to address enforcement priorities, including stopping illegal immigration.

He said the operation would include “investigations and prosecutions relating to immigration enforcement, such as cases involving obstruction of immigration objectives by sanctuary jurisdictions.”

All OCDETF-funded personnel and strike forces must contribute to the operation, Blanche wrote, and OCDETF-funded federal prosecutors “must devote a significant number of their weekly hours to the operation.”

The memo also said the operation would help fulfill a portion of a Trump executive order from January focused on “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” which ordered the creation of Homeland Security Task Forces.

Trump’s executive order described the role of the new Homeland Security Task Forces in a way that largely overlapped the tasks previously given to OCDETF’s strike forces, but added a new focus on immigration issues.

“The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States,” the executive order states.

In a separate memo later in March, Blanche wrote that “Reorganizing OCDETF” was among many potential reorganizations the DOJ proposed in response to an executive order implementing Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency workforce optimization initiative.

Two months later, the Trump administration asked Congress in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate OCDETF funding altogether. Instead of millions in funding for OCDETF to dole out to agencies working on big investigations, the White House proposed funding go directly to the appropriations of its partner DOJ components, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. attorneys, the department’s Criminal Division and the department’s National Security Division.

OCDETF operations would instead be led by a task force director in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, which “returns to past practice and will allow the Department to ensure continued coordination and direction of high-level cases across multiple components.”

The arrangement would allow the department to “more directly and efficiently control resources that support investigations into drug trafficking and organized crime,” the White House budget appendix stated.

Then, in a notification signed July 9, the Justice Department again told Congress that it “plans to eliminate OCDETF as a standalone $547 million appropriation.” Instead, the Trump administration wanted $500 million to go directly to other components as the DOJ “will close the OCDETF Executive Office” by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Rejected request

Around the time of the July notification, GOP-led Appropriations subcommittees in the House and Senate released separate fiscal 2026 Commerce-Justice-Science spending bills that included funding for OCDETF as a stand-alone funding line, even if at a reduced funding level.

The Senate Appropriations Committee in mid-July approved a bill that would reduce OCDETF funding by about 2 percent, or $10 million. But they made their thoughts clear in a report that accompanied the bill, a document that is often seen as guidance for agencies on congressional intent.

“The OCDETF appropriations account is primarily a reimbursement account and its elimination is infeasible without further consultations between the Committee and the Department,” the Senate report states, adding their proposal “continues to support the OCDETF program.”

Though the House bill included a 27 percent cut, to $400 million, as part of the GOP’s push to reduce government spending, the bill also kept OCDETF as a separate item.

Still, by late July, OCDETF had effectively shut down its investigative and prosecutorial operations, Padden said, as Blanche ordered the program to transfer its 5,000-plus cases to what would become the Homeland Security Task Forces.

Morelle (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

During a Sept. 10 full-committee markup on the House bill, Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., offered an amendment to boost OCDETF’s current funding and prohibit money from being used to eliminate or dismantle the program.

Rogers, the longtime appropriator who leads the House Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee, cited fiscal concerns in opposing the amendment. But he highlighted the significance of the line-item funding remaining intact.

“Equally important is the fact the House C-J-S fiscal year bill retains the task forces on its own appropriation,” the Kentucky Republican said. “Our commitment to the work of the task forces can’t be underestimated or understated.”

Rogers (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

Additionally, the panel adopted a Rogers-introduced amendment that added language into the report that accompanied the spending bill. It inserted language that the committee “commends the Department’s work regarding OCDETF and its demonstrated ability to share information efficiently and effectively across agencies to keep Americans safe.”

“The Committee directs OCDETF to continue its multi-agency coordinated effort to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal networks that present distinct transnational organized crime threats to the United States,” the language read.

Winding down

A little more than a week after that House markup, a DOJ official on Sept. 18 signed a notification to the Senate that OCDETF and two other components “will be eliminated.”

The notification said that an estimated two dozen OCDETF executive office employees would receive layoff notifications and referenced plans to have no employees onboard in that office by the end of that month.

The program would release its leased space at the Government Accountability Office building, the DOJ said, and a notification would be sent to Congress in the fall to remove OCDETF from the department organizational chart.

“OCDETF will not require pending or future appropriations,” the notification states.

When he left at the end of September, Padden said the plan was for there to no longer be any OCDETF employees by the end of October.

Meanwhile, after the longest partial shutdown in history this fall, the government reopened under a continuing resolution that lasts through Jan. 30 and requires the current rate of funding to continue for OCDETF. One congressional staffer saw this possibility early in the process and asked the Justice Department about it, according to records filed in an unrelated lawsuit.

Preemptively disbanding OCDETF by Sept. 30 “would render the Department unable to continue activities under a Continuing Resolution or other FY 26 Appropriations Act that specifically funds such activities,” the congressional staffer noted.

The department, in the records, said it recognized “that we may need to reassess the situation once our appropriations are enacted.”

And if funding was provided for OCDETF under a continuing resolution or a full-year appropriation, the department said it would “continue to execute the funding consistent with its underlying purposes, including providing it to law enforcement agencies. This can be accomplished without the existing OCDETF infrastructure.”

A Justice Department spokesman, in response to written questions, said the DOJ “has not ‘closed’ OCDETF as you suggest.”

Resources that OCDETF previously provided to law enforcement organizations will still be provided to those agencies, the spokesman said, and all cases have been transferred to Homeland Security Task Forces, which is “a priority of this administration.”

The move also will save millions in “bureaucratic spending” and “allows for improved interagency integration, operational flexibility, and more legal tools to bear, while mitigating weaknesses attributed to competing interests of non-unified investigations.”

The spokesman did not respond to additional questions. Neither the full House nor Senate has passed the stand-alone C-J-S spending bills approved by their respective appropriations committees earlier in the year.

A White House spokesperson, in a statement, called the Homeland Security Task Forces a “landmark achievement.”

“The American people are safer today because of the HSTFs — and they’re just getting started,” the spokesperson said.

Congressional response

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DOJ funding, wrote a letter in September to Attorney General Pamela Bondi that slammed the move away from OCDETF.

“The Department seems to have relinquished its role as the agency leading the country’s fight against illicit narcotics trafficking and the worst of the worst cartels and organized crime syndicates,” Van Hollen wrote.

Van Hollen (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)

The department and Congress have a history of working together on controversial spending plan proposals, Van Hollen wrote. But under the Trump administration, the government moves forward “regardless of the law and clear Congressional intent to do otherwise.”

“I am disappointed by the deterioration of this relationship,” Van Hollen said.

Morelle filed a bill to prevent the disbanding of OCDETF. “The administration, it appears, has no interest in what Congress thinks,” Morelle said in an interview. “Members of Congress I think on both sides support it. I’m going to continue to fight for it.

Unlike the denouncements from Democrats, their Republican counterparts have not publicly raised alarm bells.

In separate statements, the top two Republican lawmakers on subcommittees overseeing Justice Department appropriations did not criticize the move to shutter the program.

Rogers, who voiced support for OCDETF at the September markup, said he’s spoken to the DOJ about fighting transnational criminal networks, and that the House funding bill “reflects our shared intent to protect this great nation.”

“The Trump Administration has successfully ramped up our homeland defense, and we’ll continue to work together on reorganization efforts that lead to reducing foreign threats and making America safer,” Rogers said in a statement.

Moran (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)

Kansas GOP Sen. Jerry Moran likewise avoided criticizing the administration’s decision to push past congressional intent on OCDETF.

Instead, he said “joint task forces” have been successful in investigating criminal activity. His office said his statement referred to joint task forces whose work was previously reimbursed through OCDETF, but is now being carried out through the Homeland Security Task Forces.

“I will continue working with my colleagues on both the House and Senate appropriations committees on how to best align the budget with the administration’s goals while making certain the work of the law enforcement task forces can continue,” he said.

Moving forward

The Homeland Security Task Forces were fully implemented in September.

As part of the HSTF framework, the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, formed the National Coordination Center, which provides the task forces with intelligence and operational support, according to the FBI.

At an event in October, Trump touted the work of the Homeland Security Task Forces, saying it had seized deadly drugs and illegal firearms.

Trump at the event said he directed the creation of the HSTF to bring together “all federal, state and local partners to achieve the national policy goal of eliminating the cartel presence in America once and for all.”

“It’s early and the results are spectacular,” Trump said.

But Padden wrote in his online post that comments at the event were “misleading, self-serving, and unfair,” as the HSTF received cases that had been initiated and developed by OCDETF task forces under the Biden administration.

“The statistics quoted during that White House event should be attributed appropriately,” Padden wrote. “The Trump Administration did not invent interagency cooperation, it has been working for decades.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/bondi_BC_171_062325-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 21:57:48.820163

California Assemblymember Alex Lee said California has a recently enacted law, described as a “No Secret Police” measure, that bars law enforcement from wearing facial coverings.","AURORA | State legislators from Aurora, Denver and various states outlined a growing collection of state-level bills they say will protect civil rights, reinforce due process and restrict cooperation with federal agents in response to the Trump Administration’s immigration and deportation policies.

“When the federal government fails to uphold the rule of law, states are stepping up to protect communities and defend constitutional principles,” said Gabby Goldstein, State Futures president and founder.

Lawmakers representing California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia named some of the legislation they introduced or are introducing to push back against the federal government’s tough immigration policing during a Zoom press briefing Thursday. The initiatives include banning agreements or federal pacts between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and state and local law enforcement, prohibiting law enforcement from wearing masks, protections for “sensitive locations” such as schools and libraries and creating private rights of action for civil rights violations.

Colorado Democratic Aurora Sen. Mike Weissman said Aurora was “ground zero” for heightened political attention on immigration enforcement. He described Colorado’s recent work as part of a multi-state effort to develop remedies to protect constitutional rights.

“You see many states on this Zoom today, because right now, states are not just a laboratory of Democracy, as Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, they are also laboratories where remedies are being developed to protect our country from the disease of authoritarianism that is spreading out from Washington DC,” Weissman said. “As different states work together to defend democracy and civil rights, and basic human decency. It’s never been more important in our lifetimes that like-minded state legislators, like those here, work together to share ideas and strategies.”

Weissman said that Colorado’s Senate Bill 25-276 says the constitution protects everyone regardless of immigration status. The measure was signed into law in 2025, and it bars jail officials from delaying a person’s release to facilitate an immigration enforcement operation and strengthens limits on cooperation with immigration enforcement without proper judicial authorization.

This includes protecting state and local government data sources from “improper prying federal efforts” and requiring data security policies at a number of essential community locations, such as schools, health care facilities, and child care centers, he said.

It also further clarified in state law that so-called ICE detainers are not lawful arrest warrants within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, and it updated and enhanced privacy protections in the Colorado Privacy Act for commercial geolocation data.

Finally, he said, it allows both injunctive relief and the possibility of civil monetary penalties for violation of the above protections “because rights need to be backstopped by remedies to be meaningful to people.”

“I have personally gained ideas from discussions like this that I hope to turn into policy with my colleagues here in Colorado next session,” Weissman said. “I also hope that our efforts that we have shared with colleagues in other states can turn into policy in other parts of our country as well.”

Rep. Lorena Garcia, D-Denver, also brought up Colorado’s 2023 law restricting the use of intergovernmental service agreements to detain people for ICE and limiting certain local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. She said Colorado lawmakers plan to introduce additional bills in the coming session focused on accountability, liability for improper information sharing, and additional trust-building measures.

“We all see that ICE is actually, in fact, not a law enforcement agency,” Garcia said. “It is a lawless agency.”

New York state Sen. Andrew Gounardes said he proposed a bill to limit when local governments and law enforcement can collaborate with ICE, generally requiring a judicial warrant. New York Sen. Zellnor Myrie proposed a bill that would allow people to sue for damages when constitutional rights are violated.

“These are our neighbors,” Gounardes said. “These are our coworkers. These are our children’s classmates. They pay taxes, they have businesses, they have jobs, they’re contributing members of our society.”

New York Sen. Patricia Fahy described legislation she’s sponsoring, dubbed the MELT Act, framed as an effort to require federal immigration agents operating in New York to be clearly identifiable, arguing public safety depends on public trust.

“The idea of federal agents acting like secret police or paramilitary units abducting people off our streets in broad daylight has been destroying that trust,” Fahey said.

New York Assemblymember Michael Asher said he created sensitive location protections to bar civil immigration arrests near schools, houses of worship, health care facilities, homeless shelters, nonprofits and government agencies. New York Sen. Shelly Mayer also enacted school-focused policies requiring judicial warrants and documented procedures before immigration agents could enter school spaces.

“I know that in my district, in urban districts and in rural districts, parents are afraid to send their children to school because of the activities of ICE,” Mayer said.

California Assemblymember Alex Lee said California has a recently enacted law, described as a “No Secret Police” measure, that bars law enforcement from wearing facial coverings. She also mentioned additional laws that restrict immigration enforcement’s access to schools without a judicial warrant, as well as budget investments in immigrant legal services and state litigation capacity.

Illinois Sen. Graciela Guzman described a bill proposal that would combine “safe spaces” guidance for hospitals, courthouses, schools, higher education, and child care centers with accountability provisions, such as a state civil cause of action for constitutional rights violations during civil immigration enforcement.

“This is about the Constitution,” Guzman said. “This is about whether we allow fear to become policy. If the federal government wants to push an agenda of intimidation, the state of Illinois and the states on this call will continue to push back with law, with organizing, with rapid response and with solidarity that does not fracture under pressure.”",https://sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-11.33.27-AM.png,N,,2025-12-18 19:56:38.226944

Avelo conducted 20% or more of the ICE Air flights each month from July to October, according to the report.","Why Should Delaware Care?

The involvement of Avelo Airlines, the only commercial air provider for Delaware, with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become a target of criticism in recent months. A new bill would seek to cut any public support from an airline in such a position.

Delaware lawmakers will introduce legislation this week to strip financial incentives from Avelo Airlines unless they stop conducting deportation flights amid the Trump administration’s ramped-up removal tactics.

State Sen. Ray Seigfried (D-North Brandywine) and Rep. Mara Gorman (D-Newark) will file a bill Thursday that would also bar the Delaware Department of Transportation from working with airlines that deport people without a valid judicial warrant or demonstration of due process. That would essentially prevent the use of state-owned resources like Wilmington Airport for such uses, but wouldn’t end Avelo’s service in Delaware.

While applicable generally, the legislation is geared specifically toward Avelo Airlines, a low-cost airline and Delaware’s only commercial air operator, that entered into a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April to deport people as part of a new initiative dubbed, “ICE Air.”

Avelo doesn’t operate deportation flights out of Delaware; it only flies commercial routes from the Wilmington Airport. But the airline does fly deportation flights elsewhere in the country, including in Arizona.

Senate Bill 207 would amend two sections of the Delaware Code to allow for the enforcement of these accountability standards regarding deportations at state airport facilities by the Delaware Department of Justice. Any commercial airlines taking part in deportations would also be disqualified from receiving an aviation jet fuel tax exemption under the bill.

In December 2022, the state of Delaware exempted Avelo from having to pay jet fuel taxes for three years, a tax break that portioned out to about $43,000 each year. The tax exemption is slated to expire this month.

“That’s distressing to think that a company that is knowingly agreeing to [deport people] would get a break for their jet fuel,” Gorman told Spotlight Delaware.

Avelo leadership has repeatedly defended the decision to work with ICE as a financial move to keep the startup airline afloat.

The decision drew immediate and widespread backlash from legislative leaders and Delaware residents as the Trump administration intensified its deportation tactics nationwide. As part of its immigration agenda, the administration has sent people to detention facilities in Guantánamo Bay, high-security prisons in El Salvador and deported immigrants to countries of which they are not from.

Avelo Airlines, which has been known to fly deportees to Mexico, did not respond to Spotlight Delaware’s request for comment on the proposed legislation Wednesday.

Lawmakers also intend to file Senate Concurrent Resolution 123 to discourage the Delaware River & Bay Authority – which manages the Wilmington Airport – from working with any businesses, like Avelo, that have contracts with ICE to deport people who have not been afforded due process.

The Delaware River & Bay Authority, a bi-state agency supported by Delaware and New Jersey that manages the airport, supports Avelo’s Delaware operations through a $500,000 annual marketing campaign using public dollars. Spotlight Delaware first disclosed that relationship in a story last month.

The DRBA previously said the contract is not about politics, but about boosting travel to the Wilmington Airport, which has struggled to retain regular commercial flights for decades. The regional agency also maintains that it uses “user fees” from bridge toll and ferry ticket collections – not direct tax dollars – to fund operations.

“While the DRBA understands and acknowledges community concerns regarding Avelo’s activities at other airports, those activities are outside the scope of the DRBA’s authority,” Delaware River and Bay Authority spokesperson James Salmon said in a statement.

Before Trump took office in 2025, ICE used contract carriers for deportation charter flights. In the spring, ICE contracted small commercial airlines to help carry out the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

In November, Avelo operated about 17% of ICE Air charter flights, which include deportation, deportation-related and domestic transfer ICE flights in the U.S., according to Human Rights First’s November ICE Flight Monitor report. The flight monitor uses publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by ICE.

Avelo conducted 20% or more of the ICE Air flights each month from July to October, according to the report.

The legislation will be considered during the 2026 Delaware legislative session that begins on Tuesday, Jan. 13.",https://spotlightdelaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Avelo-web-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 19:56:48.184488

He said that clear delineations of safe and unsafe nations would rid the EU of “excessive interpretative uncertainty” that led to a kind of paralysis for national decision-makers over border controls.
The measures also allow individual nations within the bloc to designate other countries safe for their own immigration purposes.","The European Union on Thursday said it would drastically reduce asylum claims from seven nations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia by deeming them safe countries of origin, prompting widespread outrage from human rights groups on International Migrants’ Day.

An agreement between European Parliament and the European Council, which is the group of the 27 EU heads of state, said the countries would be considered safe if they lack “relevant circumstances, such as indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict.”

Asylum requests by people from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Kosovo, India, Morocco and Tunisia will be “fast-tracked, with applicants having to prove that this provision should not apply to them,” read the announcement of the agreement. “The list can be expanded in the future under the EU’s ordinary legislative procedure.”

In 2024, EU nations endorsed sweeping reforms to the bloc’s failed asylum system. The rules were meant to resolve the issues that have divided the 27 countries since more than 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.

Under the Pact on Migration and Asylum, which goes into force in June 2026, people can be sent to countries deemed safe, but not to those where they face the risk of physical harm or persecution.

Amnesty International EU advocate Olivia Sundberg Diez said the new measures were “a shameless attempt to sidestep international legal obligations” and would endanger migrants.

French MEP Mélissa Camara said the safe countries of origins concept and others agreed to by the Council and Parliament “opens the door to return hubs outside the EU’s borders, where third-country nationals are sometimes subjected to inhumane treatment with almost no monitoring” and “undoubtedly places thousands of people in exile in situations of danger.”

Céline Mias, the EU director of the Danish Refugee Council, said “we are deeply worried that this fast-track system will fail to protect people in need of protection, including activists, journalists and marginalized groups in places where human rights are clearly under attack.”

Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP with the European Conservatives and Reformists group, said the designation sends a firm message that the EU has toughened its borders.

“Europe wants enforceable rules and shared responsibility. Now this commitment must become operational: effective returns, structured cooperation with third countries and real measures to support EU member states,” he said.

Many hospitals, including in California, have already curtailed such care or shuttered their gender-affirming care programs as a result.
Rob Bonta’s office is already suing the Trump administration for its efforts to curtail gender-affirming care and target providers of such care in California, where it is protected and supported by state law.
His office has also resisted Trump administration efforts to roll back other transgender rights, including in youth sports.
But resisting such medical interference isn’t just about gender-affirming care.","The Trump administration and House Republicans advanced measures this week to end gender-affirming care for transgender children and some young adults, drawing outrage and resistance from LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, families with transgender kids, medical providers and some of California’s liberal leaders.

The latest efforts — which seek to ban such care nationwide, strip funding from hospitals that provide it and punish doctors and parents who perform or support it — follow earlier executive orders from President Trump and work by the Justice Department to rein in such care.

Many hospitals, including in California, have already curtailed such care or shuttered their gender-affirming care programs as a result.

Abigail Jones, a 17-year-old transgender activist from Riverside, called the moves “ridiculous” and dangerous, as such care “saves lives.”

She also called them a purely political act by Republicans intent on making transgender people into a “monster” to rally their base against, and one that is “going to backfire on them because they’re not focusing on what the people want,” such as affordability and lower healthcare costs.

On Wednesday, the House passed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for youth that was put forward by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), largely along party lines.

The bill — which faces a tougher road in the U.S. Senate — bars already rare gender-affirming surgeries but also more common treatments such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers for anyone under 18. It also calls for the criminal prosecution of doctors and other healthcare workers who provide such care, and for penalties for parents who facilitate or consent to it being performed on their children.

“Children are not old enough to vote, drive, or get a tattoo and they are certainly not old enough to be chemically castrated or permanently mutilated!!!” Greene posted on X.

“The tide is turning and I’m so grateful that congress is taking measurable steps to end this practice that destroyed my childhood,” posted Chloe Cole, a prominent “detransitioner” who campaigns against gender-affirming care for children, which she received and now regrets.

Queer rights groups denounced the measure as a dangerous threat to medical providers and parents, and one that mischaracterizes legitimate care backed by major U.S. medical associations. They also called it a threat to LGBTQ+ rights more broadly.

“Should this bill become law, doctors could face the threat of prison simply for doing their jobs and providing the care they were trained to deliver. Parents could be criminalized and even imprisoned for supporting their children and ensuring they receive prescribed medication,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, one of the nation’s leading LGBTQ+ rights groups.

On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are proposing new rules that would ban such care by medical providers that participate in its programs — which includes nearly all U.S. hospitals. The health department said the move is “designed to ensure that the U.S. government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”

The department said officials will propose additional rules to prohibit Medicaid or federal Children’s Health Insurance Program funding from being used for gender-affirming care for children or for young adults under the age of 19, and that its Office of Civil Rights would be proposing a rule to exclude gender dysphoria as a covered disability.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, issued warning letters to manufacturers of certain medical devices, including breast binders, that marketing their products to transgender youth is illegal.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. “Our children deserve better — and we are delivering on that promise.”

The proposed rule changes are subject to public comment, and the Human Rights Campaign and other LGBTQ+ organizations, including the Los Angeles LGBT Center, urged their supporters to voice their opposition.

Joe Hollendoner, the center’s chief executive, said the proposed changes “cruelly target transgender youth” and will “destabilize safety-net hospitals” and other critical care providers.

“Hospitals should never be forced to choose between providing lifesaving care to transgender young people and delivering critical services like cancer treatment to other patients,” Hollendoner said. “Yet this is exactly the division and harm these rules are designed to create.”

Hollendoner noted that California hospitals such as Children’s Hospital Los Angeles have already curtailed their gender-affirming services in the face of earlier threats from the Trump administration, and thousands of transgender youth have already lost access to care.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement contrasting the Trump administration’s moves with California’s new partnership with The Trevor Project, to improve training for the state’s 988 crisis and suicide hotline for vulnerable youth, including LGBTQ+ kids at disproportionately high risk of suicide and mental health issues.

“As the Trump administration abandons the well-being of LGBTQ youth, California is putting more resources toward providing vulnerable kids with the mental health support they deserve,” Newsom said.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta’s office is already suing the Trump administration for its efforts to curtail gender-affirming care and target providers of such care in California, where it is protected and supported by state law. His office has also resisted Trump administration efforts to roll back other transgender rights, including in youth sports.

On Thursday, Bonta said the proposed rules were “the Trump Administration’s latest attempt to strip Americans of the care they need to live as their authentic selves.” He also said they are “unlawful,” and that his office will fight them.

“If the Trump Administration puts forth final rules similar to these proposals, we stand ready to use every tool in our toolbox to prevent them from ever going into effect,” Bonta said — adding that “medically necessary gender-affirming care remains protected by California law.”

Arne Johnson, a Bay Area father of a transgender child who helps run a group of similar families called Rainbow Families Action, said there has been “a lot of hate spewed” toward them in recent days, but they are focused on fighting back — and asking hospital networks to “not panic and shut down care” based on proposed rules that have not been finalized.

Johnson said Republicans and Trump administration officials are “weirdly obsessed” with transgender kids’ bodies, are “breaking the trust between us and our doctors,” and are putting politics in between families and their healthcare providers in dangerous ways.

He said parents of transgender kids are “used to being hurt and upset and sad and worried about their kids, and also doing everything in their power to make sure that nothing bad happens to them,” and aren’t about to stop fighting now.

But resisting such medical interference isn’t just about gender-affirming care. Next it could be over vaccines being blocked for kids, he said — which should get all parents upset and vocal.

“If our kids don’t get care, they’re coming for your kids next,” Johnson said. “Pretty soon all of us are going to be going into hospital rooms wondering whether that doctor across from us can be trusted to give our kid the best care — or if their hands are going to be tied.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3b8f57/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2Fce%2F1025db0849da8838736725186e94%2Fgettyimages-2251913431.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:57:27.573684

We should all be able to travel to visit our loved ones and explore new places. But right now, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is going after immigrants in new and harmful ways. Traveling through U.S. airports can be risky, even if you have active or pending legal immigration status and/or have traveled without issues in the past. That’s why it’s more important than ever to know your rights and how to prepare for risks as you travel.

This resource gives travel safety tips and other resources on how to understand the risks and prepare yourself and your family.

Disclaimer: This resource provides general information. It is not legal advice specific to your situation. We recommend that community members exercise caution and speak to an immigration lawyer about their individual cases.

What’s Happening

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the government agency that handles airport security, is giving passenger information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This means people who don’t have legal immigration status or whose status is uncertain could be arrested or deported when they go through airport security in the United States.

How does it happen? A few times each week, TSA sends ICE lists of people flying through U.S. airports. These lists include names, photos, and other details. ICE checks these lists against its own records. If ICE finds someone they want to target, they can send officers to arrest that person at the airport.

Isn’t my private information protected? Normally, government agencies have rules about sharing private information. But TSA and ICE are both part of the same department – the Department of Homeland Security – so those rules don’t apply here.

Is ICE already arresting people at airports? Yes. The New York Times reported on December 12, 2025, that TSA is sharing this information with ICE. Before that, there were already reports of ICE arrests at airports. For example, on November 20, ICE arrested college student Ana Luccía López Belloza at Boston’s Logan Airport while she was waiting to board a flight to visit family for Thanksgiving. She had an old deportation order, though she didn’t know it.

Who Is at Risk of Arrest by ICE at U.S. Airports?

If you are undocumented or have temporary immigration status, there is a significant risk of arrest at a U.S. airport. People with deportation orders face a particularly high risk. All non-citizens face some risk, especially people whose status is uncertain or who have risk factors we will describe here. Here is more information to help you understand your risk:

Old deportation orders: If you have an old deportation order on your record, you are at high risk of arrest. This is true even if you didn’t know you had an old deportation order or if the order is from when you were a child. It is also true if your deportation order is from an expedited deportation process.

How do you check if you have a deportation order? If the government ever gave you paperwork with an “alien registration” number (A-number), you can check online using the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) website or by calling this hotline: 1-800-898-7180.

Legal status that the government revoked (or will soon revoke): You are at high risk of arrest if you had temporary legal status, but the government has terminated, or ended, that status, including Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This includes people who entered the United States on parole, but that parole status has expired or the government has ended the parole program. The most common examples are people who entered through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) process, Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), and CBP One program. The government also recently announced that it is ending several family reunification parole programs on January 14, 2026 for people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras.

Pending applications: ICE is arresting and detaining people even if they have submitted an application for immigration status in the United States. This means you may be at risk of arrest at an airport even if you have applied for asylum, a green card (lawful permanent residence), or other types of permanent protection. This also includes applications to change or extend your status while in the United States.

Any criminal history: If you are not a U.S. citizen and have had any criminal arrests (even if the case was dropped), immigration officers may try to arrest you.

Immigration law counts some things as “convictions” even if you were told your case was closed or your guilty plea was withdrawn. It is best to have an immigration attorney with experience in deportation cases review your file to be sure.

Green card holders: Immigration officers can still arrest green card holders if they have certain criminal convictions (even minor ones) or other risk factors. Please review our resource on this topic to assess your risk.

DACA holders and other people with Deferred Action: ICE has detained a number of people with Deferred Action for Certain Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. Traveling through an airport can be risky, even if you have DACA or another form of Deferred Action. For the latest information on DACA, please review this Home is Here resource.

Travel Safety Tips

Know your rights at the airport.

Be ready for extra screenings or questions from TSA, Customs and Border Protection or other immigration law officers.

The ACLU has a resource that describes what may happen and explains your rights if questioned, and Just Futures Law has additional tips and suggestions.

Bring physical copies of important documents, including:

Proof of lawful status or any pending applications

Certified copies of criminal court orders, if your case was closed.

Secure your devices (phones, laptops, etc.).

If you are traveling with a cell phone or other device, take steps to make it less likely law enforcement will search that device. For example, we recommend you print your ticket so you don’t need to open your phone when you board the plane. You should also sign out of your email accounts.

You can find more detailed tips from Freedom of the Press Foundation and from Just Futures Law.

Make a safety plan – just in case.

Memorize phone numbers for a lawyer and at least one loved one who can be on-call in case you need help.

If you are arrested and detained, ICE will not share information about your case with anyone unless you have signed this specific privacy waiver form. Consider signing one or more of these forms and leaving them with a loved one in case you are detained.

Special consideration for parents:

ICE has a policy that says that parents in detention have the right to make decisions about what happens to their children. However, ICE doesn’t always follow its own policies.

One way to protect your children is to set up temporary guardianships so that a trusted adult or friend can take care of them if you are detained.

The harm is even worse when basic factual evidence, such as full videos and orders, are also hidden from the American people.

Since September, the Trump administration has ordered 26 lethal strikes on civilian boats in international waters, killing 99 people and upending countless lives. The administration continues to push unsubstantiated, fear-mongering claims about who these people were, despite investigations showing that some of those killed were fishermen just trying to make a living for their families. The administration also refuses to release the secret memo that purports to provide a legal justification for these killings, or the full, unedited videos of the strikes themselves.

The danger is not just the body count, horrific as it is. It’s the precedent: a president asserting the power to redefine civilians as “combatants,” and pretend he has the authority to grant advance immunity to federal officials for killing people. That is an egregious abuse of power with life-or-death consequences, and it will only stop if the courts, Congress, and the public make clear that this cannot continue.

Why Trump’s Boat Strikes Memo Must Be Made Public

Under both U.S. and international law, it is flagrantly illegal to use the military to kill civilians suspected only of crimes. The United States is not in an armed conflict with anyone in Latin America. That means the people on these boats are civilians. Civilians, including those suspected of smuggling drugs, are not lawful targets. Just because The Trump administration says these strikes are firmly grounded in law doesn’t make it true.

The Trump administration is relying on a secret opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to justify these ongoing strikes. This memo reportedly details the Trump administration’s legal reasoning behind a couple of its totally incorrect conclusions: that the strikes are lawful because the United States is in an “armed conflict” with unspecified drug cartels, and that the officials who have authorized or carried out these strikes should not be prosecuted for murder or other crimes. Even as legal experts from across the political spectrum have debunked these claims, the administration has refused to release the OLC memo or any related records.

That’s why the ACLU, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) have filed a lawsuit demanding the immediate release of the OLC opinion and related documents about these boat strikes. If the Trump administration is relying on an OLC opinion to justify killing civilians in international waters, the public has a right to read it. Our lawsuit argues that the government has violated the Freedom of Information Act by refusing to release any records, despite FOIA’s clear deadlines and the urgent public interest in understanding how the administration is attempting to legally rationalize ongoing killings. We cannot be a nation of secret laws.

The devastation wrought by the Trump administration’s secret legal reasoning is not hypothetical. On September 2, after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly gave an order to “kill everybody” on a boat in the Caribbean, according to media accounts, Admiral Frank Bradley ordered one or more additional strikes on two civilians who survived an initial strike and were ultimately killed after clinging to the boat’s wreckage for more than 40 minutes. After watching the video of this apparent “double-tap” strike, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said to reporters, “What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service.” When questioned about these heinous strikes, the White House press secretary insisted that they were carried out “in accordance with the law of armed conflict,” citing the “DOJ Office of Legal Counsel opinion and other related documents.”

We’re asking a court to step in. The president doesn’t have the power to create a private, secret legal universe where cold-blooded murder of civilians can be recast as lawful policy. Courts ordering disclosure of these documents is a crucial step toward transparency, accountability, and stopping the strikes.

Congress Must Demand Transparency and Accountability Now

At the same time, we’re pushing Congress to do its job: conduct real oversight, in public. We know that when the U.S. government is implicated in horrific and criminal conduct, transparency cannot wait. For example, in 2008, after reporting revealed that the U.S. was torturing prisoners at a US-run prison in Iraq known as “Abu Ghraib,” the Senate Armed Services Committee moved within days to hold public hearings with the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By contrast, more than three months after the boat strikes, Congress has not held any hearings on the killings. Everything has been behind closed doors, other than the bits of video that Hegseth wants the public to see.

We have also made clear that oversight cannot stop with the “double-tap” strike, but must probe all the illegal strikes. As the ACLU explained in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee, while killing shipwrecked survivors is undoubtedly unlawful and grotesque, so too are the other 24 strikes that have been carried out in our name. As a chorus of legal experts have repeatedly explained, the United States may not use lethal force against any of the civilians in these boats. Upholding the rule of law means stopping illegal killing in its entirety, not just addressing its most nightmarish moments.

Even members of Congress who support the strikes, like Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, agree that the full unedited videos should be released. Military officials have repeatedly told members that they could be released as well.

That’s why we’re calling on Congress to:

Hold immediate public hearings on President Trump’s illegal boat strikes, with testimony from Secretary Hegseth and every official who planned, authorized, or carried them out.

Force transparency by insisting that the secret OLC opinion, unedited videos of the strikes, and the underlying orders be made public.

Make clear that killing civilians is a crime, not a policy choice and that the president does not have the authority to act as judge, jury, and executioner.

Transparency can’t wait while the government murders more people. That’s why we’re asking everyone to send a message to their representatives in Congress urging them to act now. Demanding answers, insisting on public hearings, and refusing to accept secret law as a license to kill, is how we can all help stop these unlawful strikes and defend the basic principle that no one – not even the president – is above the law.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/trump-boat-strike-2-social.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:59:22.503791

It’s unclear if people will be criminally charged for throwing snow at agents.","ICE, meet snow. As federal agents aggressively raid and detain immigrants in cities across the US, people working to prevent these arrests are using the abundant snow on the ground to fight back.

In videos of confrontations in Minnesota and Illinois, people have thrown snowballs at federal agents who are trying to apprehend their neighbors, often as agents are using force or wielding weapons. In many instances, the agents then responded with more aggression, using pepper spray or teargas against protesters.

In Minneapolis on Monday, agents tried to arrest a woman, holding her in a snowbank, according to video of the incident posted by Minnesota Public Radio. At one point, she appears to be partially handcuffed, and an agent drags her around a snowy street. Bystanders shout at the agents to “let her go” as a chorus of car horns and whistles blare to let the neighborhood know agents are there. An agent holds a taser in one hand and points a weapon at the crowd. People start throwing snow at the agents, one of whom holds a canister of orange spray he repeatedly uses on the protesters.

One woman who joined the scene told the Associated Press that ICE agents were aggressive from the start of the interaction. “I didn’t see anybody throw any hard items,” she said. “The snowballs were definitely being thrown, but we didn’t start throwing snowballs until they started dragging her around by her wrist.”

Brian O’Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, spoke out against ICE tactics after the incident. Federal agents called local police to the scene, claiming they were under attack. He said his officers determined the scene was safe, so they “disengaged”.

“We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation, but unfortunately that is … often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city,” O’Hara said.

Protesters also threw snow at agents in Elgin, Illinois, during a confrontation over a man’s detention. Agents responded with teargas and pepper munitions, local media reported.

As ICE has ramped up its actions, communities have responded with rapid networks seeking to prevent immigrant arrests and deter ICE from patrols – from blowing whistles, to shouting at agents, to throwing snowballs. The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota sued the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies this week, alleging on behalf of several Minnesota plaintiffs that agents have violated the rights of those observing and protesting ICE actions in the state.

When asked about people throwing snowballs at federal agents in Minneapolis and Chicago, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said: “ICE stays frosty … but rioters should be aware, assaulting an officer is a federal crime.”

According to reporting by CBS, agents have arrested US citizens related to the incident, with DHS saying people throwing snow and objects at agents caused injuries, “including cuts”. It’s unclear if people will be criminally charged for throwing snow at agents.

Throwing snowballs can be assault, if the person on the other end is injured or caused bodily harm, or if the intent is to injure, said Joe Tamburino, a Minneapolis criminal defense attorney. Though criminal charges over snowball-throwing are not common, if the subject is a federal agent, it can be a federal felony with steep penalties depending on the outcome, he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41f068d61dd718dc04493b1022a75c2c7fa72ccb/34_0_1052_842/master/1052.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43599213e09a44d0c95e1c4e4755b323",N,,2025-12-18 17:59:37.257373

Gender dysphoria refers to the distress caused by a mismatch between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth.
HHS is also taking steps to reverse a policy established during the Biden administration that classified gender dysphoria as a disability under federal law.
“Gender-affirming care is lifesaving care,” said Dr Jamila Perritt, an OB/GYN and the CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health.
On Thursday, the House passed separate legislation introduced by Republican Dan Crenshaw that prohibits Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for minors.","The Trump administration unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US on Thursday, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”, a term used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.

The proposal would also prohibit Medicaid funds from being used to cover this type of care. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) together cover nearly half of all American children.

“Under my leadership, and answering President Trump’s call to action, the federal government will do everything in its power to stop unsafe, irreversible practices that put our children at risk,” Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, said in a statement.

“This administration will protect America’s most vulnerable. Our children deserve better – and we are delivering on that promise.”

HHS also announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will send warnings to 12 companies that manufacture or sell breast binders intended for minors to treat gender dysphoria. The department alleges these companies are engaging in illegal marketing practices. Gender dysphoria refers to the distress caused by a mismatch between a person’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth.

“The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics peddled the lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,” Kennedy said at a Thursday press conference. “This is not medicine. It is malpractice.”

It was revealed on Wednesday that the Trump administration terminated several multimillion-dollar grants to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), citing concerns about “identity-based” language. The cuts followed the AAP publicly criticizing Kennedy’s overhaul of federal vaccine policy.

HHS is also taking steps to reverse a policy established during the Biden administration that classified gender dysphoria as a disability under federal law. A newly proposed update to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 would specify that “disability” and “individual with a disability” do not include gender dysphoria unless it stems from a physical impairment.

These moves have already been met with heavy criticism from health experts, lawmakers, and LGBTQ+ rights organizations.

“Gender-affirming care is lifesaving care,” said Dr Jamila Perritt, an OB/GYN and the CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health. “Today’s proposed rules are a deliberate and targeted attack on transgender youth, their families, and the clinicians committed to providing patients the care they need … This is a lose-lose situation where lives are inevitably on the line.”

Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the senior vice-president of public engagement campaigns at the Trevor Project, said: “Everyone in this country should have access to the care they need to stay healthy, including transgender and nonbinary young people. Personal medical decisions ought to be made between patients, their doctors and their families – not through a one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government.”

New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, also released a statement: “This president would rather target young people than lower costs or expand access to health care. It is reprehensible that our federal government is intent on hurting and isolating the adolescents it is supposed to protect. I will use every tool at my disposal to fight this proposal and protect transgender Americans and their families.”

These proposals represent the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at limiting access to certain forms of transgender healthcare for both children and adults.

During the opening weeks of his second term, Donald Trump signed several executive orders focused on transgender issues, including one asserting that only two sexes exist and another that barred federal funds from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors.

HHS released a review in May stating that the evidence supporting the effects of gender-affirming care for minors “is very low”, a conclusion that diverges from the position of most major US medical organizations, which support access to such care and have criticized efforts to restrict it.

On Wednesday night, the House passed a bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, to prohibit people under the age of 18 from receiving gender-affirming care by criminalizing providers.

Democratic congressman Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, warned the legislation could criminalize parents, calling it “the most extreme anti-transgender legislation to ever pass through the House of Representatives and a direct attack on the rights of parents to work with their children and their doctors to provide them with the medical care they need”.

On Thursday, the House passed separate legislation introduced by Republican Dan Crenshaw that prohibits Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for minors.

Neither bill is expected to receive enough Democratic support to advance through the Senate.

“We understand that many of our neighbors may feel concerned for their safety,” Mayor Andrew Ginther said. “Please know that we stand with you and everyone who calls Columbus home.”

Ginther reassured residents that city resources will not be used to aid in federal immigration efforts. Chief Elaine Bryant said Columbus police officers are not involved in ICE operations; residents will not be investigated based solely on immigration status, but only if there’s evidence of a crime.

“We cannot prevent ICE from being here, but if there is illegal or dangerous conduct, CPD officers will be present to maintain public safety,” Bryant said.

ICE has not announced the number or nature of Thursday’s arrests.

“The federal officers operating in our city are not sharing their playbook with us,” Ginther said. “They have not informed us of where they will be, how long they will be here, or the tactics they will use.”

Both the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office and the Ohio State Highway Patrol stated that none of their officers are involved in ICE activities.

City Attorney Zach Klein said he’s aware of the reported operations in the city.

“Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration,” Klein said in a statement.

Ginther urged residents to carry identification and immigration documentation, and to remain calm and truthful when confronted by agents. Officials also said people should not sign anything they don’t understand until they have proper legal representation.

“Do not obstruct federal operations,” Ginther said, adding that people do not have to allow immigration agents onto their private property unless those agents have a warrant from a judge.

“We know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid,” Klein said. “You are all valued members of our city, and we’re fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground.”

Ginther called on community members not to share unverified information, which can create additional fear.

“Fear is real and a lot of our immigrant neighbors are scared right now, but courage is how we respond and that courage is what will define us,” Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin said. “Right now, our neighbors will need us to be brave for them.”

“While we see the Trump Administration trying to use religion as a tool to justify repression,the majority of religious Americans see welcoming and caring for those in need a core part of our values,” said Rev.","Interfaith Alliance, a leading national advocate for religious freedom and civil rights, launched a powerful new nationwide advertising campaign today that contrasts ICE’s brutality against immigrant families and communities with the holy season’s religious calling to “love thy neighbor.”

Backed by a $300,000 spend across digital, broadcast television and streaming services, the confronting 30-second ad contrasts images of ICE violence with scenes of families gathering together for Christmas and the holiday season. Set to “O Holy Night,” it shares the message: “In America, We Love One Another. Choose Love Not ICE.” The ad will target several media markets that have seen particularly intense and widespread crackdowns by federal immigration agents, including Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana.

The full ad can be viewed here. It will run on digital, broadcast television and streaming platforms nationwide through Christmas.

‍The ad campaign urges religious Americans to sign on to this message: “This holy season, ICE cruelty is threatening our religious calling to love our neighbors — in our houses of worship and in our communities. As faithful Americans, as an expression of our values, we demand that the federal government stop the attacks on our neighbors and we call on our political and religious leaders to stand in solidarity against their cruelty.”

“The holiday season reminds us that religion can be a force for compassion, solidarity and love – and that religious Americans can and must speak out about the cruelty we see against immigrants and other vulnerable communities all around us,” said Reverend Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, president and CEO of Interfaith Alliance. “As the ‘Choose Love Not ICE’ campaign makes clear, people of faith in this country have a huge role to play in supporting democratic, non-violent efforts to help immigrant families, challenge ICE, and to oppose authoritarianism in all its forms.”

Across the country, many faith leaders have put their bodies and congregations on the frontlines to resist ICE and protect immigrant families. In several churches and congregations nationwide, nativity scenes have recently depicted the Holy Family facing or hiding from ICE harassment – a striking call to recognize how today’s oppression goes against core religious beliefs and traditions.

In November, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops released a special video message recognizing the fundamental dignity and rights of immigrants. Religious leaders and groups including Interfaith Alliance have helped spearhead major faith group participation in anti-authoritarian “No Kings” protests this year. Meanwhile, DHS and ICE have sought to use religious scripture to justify ICE’s “righteous” crackdowns.

“While we see the Trump Administration trying to use religion as a tool to justify repression,the majority of religious Americans see welcoming and caring for those in need a core part of our values,” said Rev. Raushenbush. “When we see heavily armed federal agents seizing families, hurting protesters, and in some cases even invading sacred religious spaces and arresting faith leaders, we feel outraged and alarmed. That’s why people of faith have such an important role to play in defending democracy, diversity and dignity for all Americans.”

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First.

We are experiencing an era of democratic backsliding with rights long taken for granted coming under attack by authoritarian tactics at both the federal and state levels. Democratic backsliding is a slow process of consolidating authoritarian power through steady and calculated restrictions. The sanctity of a free press is a litmus test for the health of a democracy-and its repression a litmus test for the strength of authoritarian power. In the United States, we are watching an escalation of targeted attacks against journalists, media platforms, and public dissent writ large. The Trump Administration’s rapid concentration of executive power and far-reaching repressive policies are clear examples of democratic backsliding.

The United States has a complex history with dissent — particularly during moments of political and social upheaval. From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s to the Vietnam War protests that followed, and more recently the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, authorities have repeatedly responded to times of political unrest with violence, surveillance, and suppression. While the tactics directed against journalists and dissenters are not new, what we are witnessing today is an escalation of the democratic failures of the past. In 2024 alone, at least 48 journalists were arrested or detained in the United States while reporting on protests related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, and yet this is not the first time our democratic values have been tested in this way. Today’s wave of repression marks a troubling evolution, one in which the tools of immigration enforcement and national security are increasingly intertwined with domestic policing to silence both citizens and non-citizens alike.

A recent indicator of democratic erosion in the United States began on April 17, 2024, when protesters at Columbia University gained national attention for their solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. During these demonstrations, journalists covering the events at times faced intimidation, arrests, and aggressive crowd-control tactics – signaling a troubling shift in how this administration and its supporters would deal with those they viewed as political threats. These campus demonstrations were an early warning of how easily dissent can be reframed as disloyalty—a pattern now visible across the country.

The most widespread attacks on free speech are being interwoven with repressive immigration policies, including those targeting foreign journalists. In September the Department of Homeland Security proposed new regulations that would significantly alter the process for journalists to stay and work in the United States. Under the current “duration of status” system, these visa-holders may remain in the country as long as they comply with the terms of their visa. The proposed rule would replace that flexibility with fixed admission periods that limit journalists to 240 days, without explicit or consistent extension criteria. More troubling still, the rule grants immigration officials broad discretion to deny extensions based on political beliefs or affiliations, effectively allowing ideology to dictate who can report within the United States. By transforming visa status from a legal pathway into a precarious privilege, this proposal poses a direct threat to press independence, and the free exchange of ideas.

These visa changes could be used to quash dissenting voices, a critical attack on our democratic norms, using punitive approaches to suppress political dissent by framing journalists as national threats. British journalist Sami Hamdi, an outspoken critic of Israel, was detained by ICE officers, and shortly afterward, his visa was revoked in October. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson defended the action, stating, “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.” Hamdi’s detention sends a chilling message: criticism of the U.S. or Israel’s policies could be met with immediate consequences.

Recent actions by this administration are collapsing the distinction between legitimate governance and coercive control, allowing state actors to frame suppression as security and censorship as stability. Some news outlets, like 60 Minutes, have borne the brunt of the Trump administration’s hostility and attacks. Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS’s “60 Minutes,” agreed to a $16 million settlement, rather than fighting a lawsuit brought by Trump against 60 Minutes for broadcasting an edited interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

The administration’s retaliation has extended even to one of the most widely respected news organizations in the world. In February 2025, the Associated Press was outlawed by the White House press pool after publishing reports that contradicted the Trump administration’s public narrative. In response, the Associated Press sought reinstatement through federal courts, a measure that illustrates how far the administration was willing and is willing to go to control who may have access to the White House and what information reaches the mainstream public. Banning a major wire service from the press pool signifies that independent reporting is not just discouraged but actively punished, representing a dangerous escalation. Similarly, on October 15th the Department of Defense issued an ultimatum for Pentagon press, requiring journalists to sign a “pledge” to not gather nor publish any unapproved information, even if it is unclassified. This change resulted in a mass exodus and the New York Times bringing a lawsuit against the Pentagon. This is yet another example of this administration’s blatant attempt to control the flow of information and stifle a free press, a subjugation tactic long embraced by dictators around the world.

The administration’s hostility toward media critics has not been confined to traditional news outlets. On September 11th, host Jimmy Kimmel became a target after criticizing President Trump’s response to political activist Charlie Kirk’s death, stating, “With all these terrible things happening, you would think that our president would at least make an attempt to bring us together, but he didn’t, President Obama did. President Biden did. Presidents Bush and Clinton did. President Trump did not. Instead, he blamed Democrats for their rhetoric.” In response, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr threatened ABC’s affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action.” Soon after on September 15th he was swiftly suspended with ABC news stating he was removed due to his comments — an action reversed soon after in part due to mass public outcry. Kimmel’s suspension underscored how quickly criticism can be met with punitive consequences, reinforcing a climate in which dissenting voices are disciplined rather than debated.

Piece by piece, our quintessential democratic rights are being threatened. Our ability to speak freely, express dissent, and hold power to account without fear of retaliation continues to face challenges. This erosion of rights isn’t abstract — it’s already unfolding in real time. From visa retaliation to the silencing of journalists, these are an emerging pattern that illustrates a democratic crisis on the horizon. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are bastions of a healthy democracy. Yet, with every arrest, every silenced voice, and every controlled headline, those freedoms are slipping away. History has shown us what happens when truth is seen as the enemy of those in power. This fight is not just for advocates and journalists; it’s for everyone’s right to speak, to question, and to exist without fear. As Americans, we are taught to believe in truth and transparency, and we must refuse to yield because defending free expression is not optional.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 16:58:23.083805

NEPA is a procedural statute that established parameters for assessing and disclosing the environmental impact of all major federal actions. However, decades of environmental activism from NGOs and courts morphed our national permitting system to either prevent projects entirely, or to add years and millions of dollars in costs before their completion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, CO reaffirmed the procedural nature of the law and corrected decades of its misapplication.

The SPEED Act builds off this judicial relief to modernize NEPA by:

Explicitly stating that NEPA is a procedural statute which does not mandate specific outcomes

Refocuses the scope of review for environmental analysis only on effects that are proximately caused by the project itself and may not include effects that are speculative or separate in place and time

Clarifies the major federal action definition to reduce the number of projects requiring NEPA review

Balances the need for a swift, efficient permitting system with early, meaningful consultation with state, local, and tribal partners

Implements much needed judicial review reforms to limit frivolous litigation, such as:

Clarifies that courts may not substitute their judgement on environmental effects for that of the agencies

Removes the ability of courts to vacate or enjoin agency NEPA action

Shrinks the statute of limitation to file a lawsuit under NEPA from 6 years to 150 days and clarifies who has standing to challenge an agency action

In a video posted Thursday morning, Mayor Andrew Ginther and Police Chief Elaine Bryant emphasized that local resources will not be used to support deportation efforts based solely on immigration status.

""Please know that we stand with you and everyone who calls Columbus home,"" Ginther said.

Mayor Ginther and Police Chief Bryant will be holding a press conference at 2 p.m. on Thursday. We will live-stream the event on this page.

Since 2017, the city has maintained a policy that prohibits the use of Columbus resources, including police officers, to assist federal deportation efforts or immigration investigations that are based only on a person’s immigration status.

""Columbus police officers will not investigate Columbus residents solely based on immigration status,"" Bryant said. Columbus police action will occur only when there is evidence that a crime has been committed.

They also acknowledged that they cannot prevent ICE agents from operating in Columbus. However, police officers will be present to maintain public safety if any illegal or dangerous conduct occurs.

Officials encouraged residents to continue calling 911 or Columbus police when they need help, stressing that public safety services remain available to everyone in the city.

They also urged residents to understand their rights during encounters with federal immigration agents, advising people to carry identification or documentation of their status, remain calm and truthful when interacting with law enforcement, and remember they have the right to remain silent. They also warn residents to ""not obstruct federal operations.""

Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein posted this comment on our ABC 6 Facebook Page on Thursday afternoon:

I am aware of reports that federal law enforcement officials, including ICE, are currently engaged in active operations in Columbus. I know this causes alarm and concern. Please know that the Columbus Division of Police is not involved in these sorts of immigration enforcement activities. CPD’s role is public safety, not immigration enforcement. Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration.

If anyone witnesses concerning activity, do not intervene directly or put yourself at risk. If the action is criminal in nature, always trust that you can call Columbus Police. They will respond. Additionally, sharing accurate information and looking out for one another is one of the most powerful ways our community can respond.

Lastly, we know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid. You are all valued members of our city, and we’re fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground. - Zach Klein",https://abc6onyourside.com/resources/media2/16x9/2573/1320/0x1/90/6f92eedf-a0d5-48eb-81ff-a86ab12687f7-processed054DA4ECE7B0437FA88050EA91E5E4EA.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 17:59:59.371392

Nearly 300,000 people have been deported, and a record 65,000 people are being held in detention centers. Aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, sometimes with the backing of federalized national guard units, have terrorized immigrant communities from Charlotte to Chicago, New Orleans to New York. Enabled by a supreme court ruling that “effectively legalized racial profiling”, immigration enforcement has separated families, forced targeted individuals to miss work, school and doctors appointments, and caused communities to cancel festivals and gatherings.

Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration to suppress dissent, however, Americans have responded to the aggressive assault on immigrant communities with defiance. In cities and communities across the US, residents disgusted by Trump’s attack on their neighbors are banding together in group chats on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, to coordinate community defense. The Guardian spoke with several activists – some seasoned, some brand new – about what they are doing to help.

The real-estate appraiser chasing ICE agents on bicycle

Jose was working from home on the North Side of Chicago on 9 October when he got the message on Signal: “They’re here.”

The Trump administration had launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in early September, sending hundreds of federal agents to Chicago to crack down on supposedly criminal immigrants and intimidate a largely Democratic-voting population; now they had been spotted in Rogers Park, the neighborhood where Jose had lived his entire life, harassing a well-known tamale vendor. (Jose, like many of the activists interviewed in this piece, asked to be identified by a pseudonym out of fear of being targeted by the government.)

Jose jumped on his bike and rode to the intersection in question, where he spoke to bystanders and workers in a nearby restaurant to find out what had happened. When he and a fellow responder spotted a Jeep that matched the description witnesses had given them, they chased it, catching up at a stop light. Jose pulled in front of the SUV and attempted to impede its way. The driver – possibly an ICE or CBP agent – started yelling and threatening arrest; at the urging of another activist, he decided to let the car go. Three days later, when ICE returned to the neighborhood, Jose and his fellow rapid responders had all begun wearing whistles. They followed the agents’ vehicles through the streets on their bikes, blowing their whistles to alert their neighbors to the raid.

A 49-year-old father who in the past dedicated his free time to performing in Gilbert and Sullivan productions with a local community theater, Jose had no experience in community organizing when he volunteered to join the core team of Protect Rogers Park, a group that had organized resistance activities during the first Trump administration.

“My job is real-estate appraiser of all things,” he told the Guardian. “I mean, what a double life.”

Over the spring and summer, he pitched in as the group organized neighborhood assemblies and trainings to prepare for ICE raids or direct actions. “This might seem cliche but the trainings do work,” he said. “We try to simulate what it’s like when ICE agents are in your face and yelling at you and grabbing. It’s like rehearsal, so you don’t have as much stage fright.” There was also a social component; the group set up a book club and everyone read Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny together. “It’s community building,” he said. “It’s getting to know the people you’re going to be with when the time comes to go up against ICE. Now, obviously, we’re in it.”

When Operation Midway Blitz began, Jose volunteered to do “rapid response”, but he wants others to know that confrontation is not the only way to help. “You don’t have to go chase after ICE agents,” he said. “If you can be a person behind the computer screen directing people or checking license plate numbers – that’s so helpful. Even just standing on a corner with a whistle around your neck provides incredible peace of mind to vulnerable people.”

For those who are up for chasing ICE around: “We have a few goals,” he said. “The first is you want to get more help if you’re alone. The next is you want to try to help the victim as much as possible. The last thing is slowing them down. I’m not going to be able to go up against armed ICE agents with just my bike, so I’ll just stop traffic. We want to make it so it’s just not worth their while.”

“We’re going to outlast them,” he added. “They can’t sustain this forever.”

The fetish shop owner distributing whistles

The mannequins in the windows of Red Vault in Chicago’s Rogers Park neighborhood tend to wear a selection of the shop’s fashion and fetish wares, from adult onesies to mesh tank tops and leather harnesses. Starting in October, however, store owner Mark Selner added a new accessory to the display: a cheap plastic whistle worn around the neck.

“I’ve been really angry because I was bullied when I was young, and these are bullies,” said Selner, 59, of the ICE and CBP agents who have flooded Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz. “I’m working in the store all the time so I can’t necessarily attend [protests], so what can I do? I saw people handing out whistles and I was like, let me use some of my white privilege for good.”

Sellner ordered a batch of whistles and put up a notice outside the shop that he was giving them away for free. He also posted a sign warning ICE and CBP agents that they cannot enter his business without a judicial warrant, and, on the advice of community organizers, posted a sign on his backroom that says: “Private Area, Authorized Employees Only”. Within a few weeks, he had distributed almost 400 whistles.

“I don’t want any of my customer base to be afraid to be in here,” he said. “I have the sign on the backroom so that, if need be, someone can go back there and [ICE] is not supposed to go back there legally.”

Customers have been supportive and appreciative, Sellner said.

“I had a customer ask me: ‘How much did you pay for the whistles?’ I said it was $22 and he goes: ‘Here’s $22.’ I said: ‘You don’t have to do that,’ but he was like, ‘No I want to. I’m glad you’re doing this.’

“So I used that to buy more whistles.”

The student delivering groceries to families

When the Trump administration launched a series of aggressive immigration raids in Los Angeles in June, Miguel Montes quickly saw the impact on Boyle Heights, the heavily Latino neighborhood where he was born and raised. Montes is in his final year of studies for a degree in public health, and he also works full-time as a certified medical assistant at a public hospital.

“I noticed that people were not showing up to their appointments at my job,” he said. “People were not even going out to get food, because they were scared.”

Montes’s passion for providing public health resources to his community had seen him set up an organization, Raíces Con Voz, that ran educational events about hypertension, diabetes and the health effects of climate change in his community. Now, the needs were much more immediate. With a small group of close friends, Montes spread the word that he was organizing grocery delivery for families scared of being detained by ICE. The group circulated an online signup form for families in need of support and solicited donations of goods and cash.

Since June, Montes and his group have delivered groceries to about 1,500 families. They are hoping to expand their reach to the Inland Empire; they also want to figure out a way to connect more people with mental health resources. It’s a personal issue for Montes, whose mother was undocumented until recently. As a child, he had not realized how difficult her lack of legal status made things for her.

“Being a first generation Latino, I don’t know anybody who started their own non-profit,” Montes said. “Everything that I’ve done has been trial and error.”

The parents making sure everyone gets to school safe

When the Trump administration deployed the national guard and amped up immigration enforcement in and around Washington DC this summer, some parents at a predominantly Latino elementary school in Montgomery county, Maryland, proposed setting up “walking school buses” to accompany children to school. The only problem: not everyone wanted them to.

“The community was like, ‘Nah, we don’t need the white folks walking us to school,” recalled Sarah Hunter, 47. “There were folks saying this is necessary, and folks saying ‘I don’t want you here.’ Sometimes you just have to stand in the fray and be willing to mess up.”

Hunter and her co-parent, Jane Palmer, worked with fellow parents, organizers with the Montgomery County Immigrant Rights Collective and school administration figures to come up with a plan for something that would be actually helpful. The compromise plan they hit upon may still be unwanted for some, but they decided that having to work through any conflict was worth it. “That’s not the worst outcome,” Hunter said. “The worst outcome is that we’re not there and people are getting kidnapped.”

They now have a network of about 30 volunteers who are stationed at set locations around the school for a half hour each morning and afternoon during student arrival and dismissal. The volunteers initially identified themselves with a button, but after a parent had 1,000 made, the button spread to the entire school community.

The parent organizers are in touch with other groups that are organizing ICE watch and rapid response in the area, but their volunteers are focused exclusively on the school. “Whenever ICE has been in our school area, we’ve learned about it on Signal before we saw anything visually,” Palmer said.

“We’re really not trying to do surveillance,” Hunter said. “We are greeting families in our community and getting to know each other, saying ‘good morning’, developing friendships.”

“If this does nothing but build community across these populations, then we’ve succeeded,” said Palmer. On Halloween, she wore an inflatable costume of the school’s mascot during her shift outside the school and handed out stickers with the same design as the buttons.

“It was like I was Lady Gaga or something,” Palmer said. “Everyone was talking pictures with me. Some lady handed me her baby to take a picture with … It’s about ICE watch but it’s also about how we build community.”

The undocumented social worker putting money in commissary accounts

A chilling scene keeps playing out in the halls of Manhattan’s federal office buildings. Asylum seekers attend hearings before immigration judges, receive a future hearing date, and go to leave, only to be surrounded by a crowd of masked ICE agents who arrest them and whisk them away to the bank of elevators.

The detention trap at New York’s immigration courts has attracted a cadre of dedicated court watch volunteers who bear witness to the daily abductions. Their efforts gained national attention in June, when city comptroller and then mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested as he attempted to accompany an asylum seeker from his hearing to the subway.

As Lander’s arrest showed, there is nothing the court watchers can do to prevent these detentions. Instead, they do their best to get individuals to fill out a form with their name, A-number and emergency contact. Those forms are then passed on to Mi Tlalli, a volunteer collective whose mission is both simple and expansive. “We provide ongoing care,” said Maria, a member of the collective.

What that care looks like depends on what people need, Maria said. The group has been in contact with 3,000 people and families since May, and has provided direct support to 300 detainees. For those who are being held in ICE detention centers, Mi Tlalli puts $50 in their commissary account weekly. A collective of mental health care providers meets with affected children and family members; the group also has a weekly mutual aid distribution for basic necessities.

“We maintain contact with people who have been deported,” Maria said. “It’s not like we can build them a house, but we can send some money for clothing, and give them some hope that someone cares.”

The knowledge that immigrants are cared for is crucial to Maria, who is a social worker in mental health. She recalled a recent case where an individual was detained on a Friday in New York and sent to a detention facility in Louisiana that Sunday. Mi Tlalli spoke to the individual’s family and contacted an activist group in Louisiana, which arranged to have someone visit the immigrant before they were deported.

“That was the last caring interaction that this person had,” Maria said. “That’s better than going to your court appearance and being put on a plane in chains without ever knowing that someone cared about you.”

“Right now, every undocumented person is at risk,” said Maria, who is undocumented herself. “We may not be able to save everyone, but is that going to keep us from helping anyone? As a person who has had relatives kidnapped, and is at risk of being kidnapped myself, I have to hold on to the idea that there is a way we can organize not just being resilient, not just saying ‘deal with it,’ but coming together to care for each other.”

Based solely on immigrants’ country of origin, Trump’s USCIS is both pausing and canceling green card interviews, applications, naturalization interviews, and even oath ceremonies for immigrants who have completed rigorous vetting and have secured citizenship. These are people who have followed every process and undergone extensive and repeated vetting to secure legal status.

“These naturalization ceremonies are a time of celebration, as soon-to-be U.S. citizens welcome their friends and family to witness their achievement of becoming a U.S. citizen.

,Policy,2025-12-18 19:43:49+00:00,Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,"Trump Administration, Congressional Republicans Are Worsening Affordability Challenges ...","Brendan Duke, Katie Bergh, Dottie Rosenbaum, Jennifer Sullivan, Nicole Rapfogel, Sonya Acosta",,,,,https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/trump-administration-congressional-republicans-are-worsening,"The Trump Administration and House Republicans are pursuing deep cuts to federal rental assistance in annual appropriations bills.
The Trump Administration and congressional Republicans have also taken steps that will make it harder for families with low incomes to buy groceries.
Earlier this year, Republican policymakers took active steps to make health care less affordable to families with low incomes.
The RAP will also ensnare new borrowers with persistently low incomes into longer repayment periods.
These statistics are averages and obscure some of the specific affordability challenges certain families with low and moderate incomes face.","In a nation as wealthy as ours, everyone should be able to afford to meet their basic needs – they should be able to buy enough food to feed their families, have a safe and affordable place to live, and go to the doctor and buy medication if they’re sick. Indeed, President Trump won the 2024 election with a promise to address people’s costs and make life more affordable.

But a look at the Trump Administration’s policy choices and priorities demonstrate that the Administration and congressional Republicans have taken action after action that has or will raise the cost of:

Groceries. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imported food that are raising grocery prices, while enacting the largest cuts to SNAP in history through a deeply harmful Republican megabill that will make affording groceries harder for families with low incomes.

Health care. The megabill’s large cuts to Medicaid and to Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace coverage will make it harder for families to afford the medical care they need. Moreover, the President and congressional Republicans have refused to renew the premium tax credit enhancements that help millions of people afford health care coverage. Together, these policy decisions will result in an estimated 15 million people losing health coverage, many of whom won’t be able to afford care they need.

Housing. The Trump Administration and House Republicans are pursuing deep cuts to federal rental assistance in annual appropriations bills. If enacted, these cuts will cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose support they use to help keep a roof over their heads. Moreover, sweeping tariffs on home construction inputs will add $30 billion to the annual cost of residential investment, reducing housing supply and affordability for renters as well as prospective home buyers.

Education. The Republican megabill makes it harder for new student loan borrowers to repay their debt while ensnaring them in longer maximum repayment periods, especially if they have low incomes. For the first time, new borrowers with the lowest incomes — many of them in poverty and many of whom did not complete a degree program — will have to make payments before they can afford it. And both the Trump Administration and House Republican budget proposals would make college less affordable — and encourage debt accumulation — through cuts to federal work study and the elimination of programs providing financial aid to students with low income and child care to parents attending college.

Energy. The megabill cuts more than $300 billion from energy investments, which will raise energy costs for households and businesses at a time when energy demand is projected to grow. One study estimates that households will face a 13 percent increase ($280 per year) in their energy bills by 2035 as a result of these cuts. Moreover, President Trump has proposed eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides assistance to 6 million low-income households to help them pay their energy bills and prevent utility shutoffs.

People with low and moderate incomes especially will grapple with the costs of these harmful policy choices. Fully 25 percent of households in the bottom of half of the income distribution report experiencing food insecurity or not being able to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bill compared to 8 percent of households in the top half. (See Figure 1.)

Households with incomes in the bottom half of the distribution (less than $70,000 in 2023) spend almost 90 percent of their incomes on basic items: utilities, groceries, health care, transportation, and shelter. And to help afford those basics, many need assistance, such as Medicaid, SNAP, or LIHEAP, that the Administration has put on the chopping block. Moreover, families affected by cuts in these areas receive the fewest benefits, if any at all, from the megabill’s tax cuts. That includes the bill’s Child Tax Credit expansion, which gave short shrift to 19 million children in families with low and moderate incomes.

Policy efforts to reverse course and actually improve affordability should focus on people with low and moderate incomes, who already struggle the most to afford the basics and have suffered the most from the Trump Administration’s harmful policies. This effort would start with repealing or abandoning the anti-affordability policies the Administration has pursued, and also using tried and true tools — such as extending the enhanced ACA tax credits, expanding rental assistance, and making the full Child Tax Credit available to children in families with lower incomes.

Groceries

One of the most striking challenges families with low and moderate incomes face is the rising cost of groceries, whose prices have grown faster since January 2020 (29.3 percent) than overall prices (25.4 percent). The rising price of food is especially challenging for households with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution since groceries are a necessity that makes up such a large portion of their incomes (13 percent). For households in the top half, the figure is much lower (about 5 percent).

The Trump Administration imposed sweeping, across-the-board tariffs upon taking office, raising food prices. The tariffs as they stood in October were estimated to raise the short-run price of vegetables and fruits by 3.3 percent and food as a whole by 1.9 percent above pre-tariff levels according to the Budget Lab at Yale. The Trump Administration has frequently justified its tariffs as encouraging people to replace foreign goods with domestically produced ones, but many of its tariffs applied to food products that the U.S. does not have the climate to produce at mass scale, like bananas and coffee. The Trump Administration moved this fall to exempt these products, but tariffs are still expected to raise food prices by 1.2 percent in the short run.

The Trump Administration and congressional Republicans have also taken steps that will make it harder for families with low incomes to buy groceries. The harmful megabill cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $187 billion through 2034 (about 20 percent), the largest cut in history. This program helps more than 40 million people with low incomes afford groceries each month, and some of the bill’s cuts have already gone into effect. The megabill used these cuts to cover about 4 percent of the cost of its tax cuts, whose benefits are heavily tilted to people with high incomes.

The megabill’s SNAP cuts come from a combination of slashing billions in federal funding for states’ SNAP programs, thereby forcing unaffordable and volatile costs onto states, and by cutting millions of people off from SNAP by increasing administrative hurdles and red tape. Most states will be required to newly pay 5 to 15 percent of food benefits, in addition to paying a greater share (75 percent, up from 50 percent) of SNAP’s administrative costs. If a state can’t make up for these massive federal cuts with tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere in its budget, it will have to cut its SNAP program or potentially opt out of the program altogether, terminating food assistance in the state.

The megabill also expanded already harsh and ineffective measures taking away SNAP for not meeting red tape-laden work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates will cut 2.4 million people off SNAP in a typical month. It also makes cuts that undermine the adequacy of SNAP benefits to help people afford groceries. Over time, the megabill will cut food assistance benefits for all 40 million participants, including 1 out every 5 children in the U.S.,by restricting future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the basis for SNAP benefit levels. This will lead to SNAP benefits becoming increasingly inadequate to afford a healthy diet. Other cuts in the law include a provision that makes it harder to qualify for SNAP’s Standard Utility Allowance, resulting in an estimated 600,000 households losing roughly $100 per month in food assistance. Additionally, many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. and who have been granted humanitarian protections will now be denied SNAP benefits.

Health Care

Health care costs remain one of the biggest burdens for families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution, who spend an average of about 13 percent of their incomes on it. But this average obscures the fact that health care burdens are distributed unequally. Seniors have access to Medicare (but may struggle with other affordability issues), while other adults face a varying landscape depending on whether their state has expanded Medicaid — and on whether congressional Republicans agree to extend premium tax credit (PTC) enhancements that are helping millions afford coverage. Moreover, a medical emergency or sudden illness can cause someone to suddenly begin spending a large share of their income on medical care or incurring medical debt when those costs aren’t affordable.

The PTC enhancements that help marketplace enrollees afford coverage expire at the end of 2025, but the Administration and a majority of congressional Republicans thus far remain implacably opposed to renewing them. Congress’ failure to extend PTC enhancements will leave millions vulnerable to extreme premium increases — over $1,000 annually for the average enrollee receiving the credits, and many times that for some people — and at heightened risk of becoming uninsured. (See Figure 2.) And these increases come on top of other cuts to ACA marketplace coverage in the megabill that will cause more people to become uninsured.

Earlier this year, Republican policymakers took active steps to make health care less affordable to families with low incomes. Their megabill cut Medicaid — the country’s second largest health care program, covering about 70 million people — by more than $900 billion (17 percent by 2034) to partially finance the bill’s tax cuts. One of the principal methods it uses to achieve these cuts is creating several new layers of red tape designed to remove people from coverage. That includes red tape-laden work requirements that research shows take coverage away from people who have been laid off, those who are working, and those who should be exempt. Coverage losses are often due to paperwork burdens that result in people who are still eligible losing coverage. The megabill also put in place new requirements that Medicaid expansion enrollees renew coverage every six months instead of once a year — another set of red tape that will result in coverage loss — and measures blocking eligibility and enrollment rules that would simplify enrollment.

The megabill also directly raises Medicaid expansion enrollees’ out-of-pocket health care costs. It requires states to charge those with incomes just above the poverty line ($16,000 a year for an individual) new cost-sharing charges for many services when they go to the doctor.

Housing

One of the nation’s most persistent affordability challenges is housing. Housing costs have gone up across the board for people purchasing homes, as home prices and interest rates have risen. And millions of renters face serious affordability challenges. Some 42 million people in low-income renter households pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing, a widely used benchmark for affordability, and fully 24 million in low-income renter households pay more than half of their income for housing.

Federal rental assistance is key to addressing the affordability challenges that renters face, along with efforts to boost the supply of housing in areas with shortages. Rental assistance helps roughly 10 million people — such as struggling seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and families with children — keep a roof over their heads, often by helping them afford rental units they find in the private market. But this assistance, unlike Social Security or Medicaid, is part of the annual appropriations process so it hangs in the balance with each budget season.

And as with other affordability challenges, many Republican policymakers are calling for policies that would exacerbate the problem. House Republicans’ transportation and housing appropriations bill provides far less funding than is needed to cover the cost of existing Housing Choice Vouchers, with the result that about 411,000 fewer people would receive assistance. These vouchers are the most widely used and effective tool to address homelessness and housing instability (see Figure 3), but only about a quarter of those who are eligible for vouchers or other rental assistance receive it due to limited funding. The House bill would make this worse. It would also cut funding for public housing by nearly $1.5 billion (about 17 percent), hampering the maintenance and repairs needed to protect residents’ health and safety. (The Senate bill is better, but still problematic — for example, its funding level for Housing Choice Vouchers is higher than the House but would still result in 243,000 fewer households receiving rental assistance than in 2025.)

President Trump’s budget proposals for rental assistance are even more harmful: the budget plan would replace existing rental assistance programs, including public housing and housing vouchers, with a new state-based formula grant that would receive 43 percent less funding, even as the cost of housing and the number of families struggling to afford rent has risen in recent years. It would also cut off rental assistance after two years even if participants still can’t afford rent on their own, putting over 3 million people at risk of eviction and homelessness. In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to make administrative changes to homelessness programs that would take away assistance that more than 170,000 formerly homeless people use to help them afford housing, unless Congress acts to prevent this.

The Administration’s sweeping tariffs, meanwhile, are increasing the cost of housing construction and home furnishings, raising the cost of renting or buying a home. Those tariffs include one of 10 percent on softwood timber and lumber, 25 percent on upholstered wooden products, and 25 percent on kitchen cabinets and vanities, in addition to its broader country-by-country tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and other trade partners key to this sector.

The combined effect of these tariffs is $30 billion in added annual costs to investment in residential structures, including new construction, renovations, and affordable housing development, according to the Tax Policy Center (TPC). Moreover, the prices of major appliances — a critical input for housing construction — have gone up more than twice as fast as overall inflation, according to TPC.

Education

The megabill also restructures student loan repayment plans in a manner that will increase millions of new borrowers’ monthly payments, to the tune of $270 billion which, again, the bill is using in service of its skewed tax cuts. In particular, the megabill consolidates all income-based repayment plans for new borrowers — which help keep payments manageable for borrowers with lower incomes relative to their debt levels — into a single Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) that requires far higher monthly payments than other income-based repayment plans.

Most concerningly, the RAP abandons the “income protection” approach that all other income-based repayment plans feature. Under the RAP, the lowest-income new borrowers — including those with incomes under the poverty line — will for the first time have to make payments well before they are in a position to afford it. This directly undermines the point of income-based repayment, which is to ensure that monthly payments are affordable by scaling them to income.

The RAP will also ensnare new borrowers with persistently low incomes into longer repayment periods. All previous income-based repayment plans set a maximum repayment term of 10-25 years — if someone makes the monthly payments for that entire period and there is still debt, it gets forgiven. The megabill extends that maximum period to 30 years. New borrowers who will be trapped in repayment for this long are those whose incomes remain low for decades. In many cases, those who will have to continue paying for 30 years are people who were not able to complete their degrees or who went to low-quality for-profit colleges.

The Trump Administration and House Republican budgets have also doubled down on cuts to getting a college education that would put further strain on students from families with low and moderate incomes. For example, both would cut federal work study programs that provide part-time employment to students who need help affording education, increasing these students’ reliance on debt. Similarly, both would eliminate federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which provide financial aid to low-income students, as well as the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program, which provides child care to parents with low incomes while they are in post-secondary school.

Energy

Household utility bills — including energy — are another large expense for families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution, making up 11 percent of their incomes in 2023. The pressures on families’ budgets from utility bills and energy costs may well grow further in part because of policy choices the Administration and congressional majority have made. Household fuel and utility prices have risen 5.9 percent over the last year. And they are expected to continue to rise in the face of increasing construction costs for building energy projects, due to production bottlenecks and tariffs; growing energy demand primarily from data centers; and increased natural gas exports. The Republican megabill dismantled key policies that would have mitigated the price shocks to household budgets. It made over $300 billion in cuts to clean energy tax credits and rescinded close to $8 billion in funding for grants and loans for clean energy, energy waste reduction, improvements to the electric grid, and energy upgrades in affordable housing enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These cuts drive up energy bills and by making it more expensive to install the lowest-cost forms of energy — solar and wind — and to upgrade the electric grid, and by making it harder for households to use less energy. One study estimates that, as a result of the tax credit cuts alone, cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production will fall $500 billion over the decade. And households will face a 7.5 percent increase in household energy bills by 2030, or $165 per year, rising to a 13 percent increase, or $280 per year, in 2035.

In addition to the megabill’s cuts, the Trump Administration has terminated billions of dollars in climate and energy funding contracts that would have contributed to decreasing energy costs, most notably $7 billion that would have gone toward bringing low-cost solar energy to low-income households. Meanwhile the Administration is promoting continued operation of uneconomical coal plants.

Beyond this reduction in energy investment that will drive up costs, President Trump is also pursuing budget cuts that directly reduce low-income households’ ability to afford to heat and cool their homes. The President’s budget would eliminate LIHEAP, which provides heating and cooling assistance to 6 million households with low incomes, to help prevent utility shutoffs.

Affordability Struggles Should Be Eased for Families With Low and Moderate Incomes, Not Exacerbated

An important theme in the Trump Administration and House Republicans’ policies is just how much they are stacking the deck against families already facing affordability challenges. While some policies, like the tariffs and repealing energy investments, affect families throughout the income distribution, cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, LIHEAP, and Housing Choice Vouchers largely, if not exclusively, hurt low-income families’ purchasing power.

It is this precise group for whom affordability was already the biggest challenge before Trump took office. Families with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution (making less than $70,000) spend a large share of their income on the basics: $3,700 on utilities (12 percent of income), $4,500 on groceries (13 percent of income), $4,500 on health care (13 percent of income), $7,400 on transportation (21 percent of income), and $10,600 on shelter (30 percent of income) in 2023. Those categories combined accounted for 89 percent of their income and do not include other essentials, such as clothes or household items like diapers, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. Families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution, on the other hand, spend only 43 percent of their income on utilities, groceries, health care, transportation, and shelter.

These statistics are averages and obscure some of the specific affordability challenges certain families with low and moderate incomes face. For example, child care is a small expense for families as a whole since many people do not have young children, but families close to the poverty line who use child care in a given week spend 17 percent of their income on it.

Another way to see how families with low incomes struggle with affordability is to look at how much more likely they are to report being unable to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bill, or to report food insecurity. Fully 25 percent of households in the bottom of half of the income distribution report not being able to pay one of those housing bills and/or food insecurity, while 8 percent of households in the top half do.

Any serious affordability agenda must start with improving the finances of families with low and moderate incomes. This agenda should, of course, begin with repealing the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans’ harmful policies, like cuts in health coverage and food assistance as well as broad-based tariffs. More broadly, it should make use of the proven policy tools for reducing these families’ costs in the areas where they spend the most, such as extending the enhanced ACA tax credits to address health care costs, ensuring that all states adopt the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, and expanding rental assistance to keep more people’s housing costs in check. The ultimate success of an affordability agenda should be measured by whether everyone has the opportunity not just to get by, but thrive.

Refugee Admissions Program.
I urge you to support the GRACE Act to ensure we uphold our commitment to protecting those who are forced to flee from their homes.
Support the GRACE Act to ensure the refugee admissions program remains resilient so we can all thrive and flourish.","Tens of thousands of refugees who had already been approved for resettlement in the U.S. are stranded overseas in dangerous conditions in the wake of President Trump’s indefinite refugee ban. At the same time, the Trump administration is subjecting refugees living in U.S. communities to an onslaught of attacks.

With refugee admissions still indefinitely suspended, the administration says it plans to subject all refugees who arrived in the United States between January 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 to “review and reinterview.” The process could jeopardize individuals’ ongoing protection in the United States. Simultaneously, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced a barrage of discriminatory policy changes that target people based on their nationality, including Afghans and other individuals from the 19 countries on the travel ban list.

Compounding the most recent attacks on newcomers, in October, the Trump administration announced it would set the refugee admissions target – or Presidential Determination (PD) on Refugee Admissions – at a historic low of just 7,500, with most capacity set aside for a group of predominantly white South Africans known as Afrikaners. Right now, the only people arriving in the United States via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) are Afrikaners, even as tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence and persecution remain unable to enter the U.S., despite completing years of vetting and screening.

The Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement Act (GRACE Act) would establish crucial safeguards to prevent presidential administrations from undermining the refugee admissions program.

The GRACE Act would protect the refugee admissions program from future attacks by setting a minimum annual refugee admissions target of 125,000, increasing transparency and congressional oversight to ensure USRAP is functioning as intended, and ensuring that the refugee admissions target responds appropriately to global resettlement needs.

Use the tool below to join us in urging your two Senators and one Representative to support the GRACE Act to protect the spirit of welcome that animates the refugee program.

Sample email: My name is [insert name], and as your constituent from [City/Town] and a [person of faith/refugee/member of community], I urge you to cosponsor the Guaranteed Refugee Admissions Ceiling Enhancement Act (GRACE Act) to protect the spirit of welcome that animates the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).

Right now, refugees in our communities are facing unprecedented attacks. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) intends to “review and reinterview” refugees who arrived in the U.S. between January 20, 2021, and February 20, 2025. Additionally, the administration continues to implement discriminatory policies that specifically target Afghans as well as those from the 19 countries on the travel ban list.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of highly-vetted refugees remain stranded in dangerous conditions overseas, as the Trump administration has barred all refugees from entry except for a group of predominantly white South Africans.

The GRACE Act includes a broad range of safeguards to prevent presidential administrations from undermining the refugee admissions program by establishing transparency, strengthening congressional oversight, and ensuring that the refugee admissions target is responsive to global need. The bill, led by Senator Markey and Representative Lofgren, would:

Set a minimum annual refugee admissions goal of at least 125,000. Should the administration fail to abide by statutory requirements to issue a determination before the beginning of the fiscal year, the minimum target would be automatically established. The bill also requires presidential administrations to create actionable plans to rectify challenges in the event they fall significantly behind the goal.

Encourage the administration to consider global resettlement needs and require the White House and State Department to justify their regional priorities when determining how to allocate processing capacity.

Implement guardrails that promote robust congressional oversight of USRAP, including requiring the administration to issue quarterly reports on their progress in meeting the admissions goal.

Again I urge you to cosponsor the GRACE Act to promote the strength and longevity of the U.S.’s capacity to welcome refugees fleeing violence and persecution. The evidence is clear, welcoming refugees helps us all flourish. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Washington, D.C. (December 17, 2025)—Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, led subcommittee Democrats in exposing the Trump Administration’s lawless and indiscriminate crusade against legal immigrants, taking aim at the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program and recklessly throwing more than one million individuals into legal limbo.

The hearing included testimony from: Mr. Jimmy Williams, Jr., President, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades; Mr. George Fishman, Legal Fellow, Center for Immigration Studies; Mr. Larry Celaschi, Councilman, Borough of Charleroi, Pennsylvania; and Mr. James Rogers, Senior Counsel, America First Legal.

In its quest for mass deportations and to meet Stephen Miller’s arrest quotas, the Trump Administration has done everything it can to end legal immigration, including dramatically limiting the use of Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

Ranking Member Jayapal asked Mr. Williams if his union members feel safe coming into work amid the Trump Administration’s lawless crackdown. He explained: “No. We have had horror story after horror story of members of ours that have been granted status in this country, that have been targeted on the job site for removal, followed to their homes and on the way to work, being pulled over by local law enforcement and being detained, only not to be heard from again.”

Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García said: “The Trump Administration and its loyalists in Congress continue their efforts to persecute immigrants and undermine our legal immigration system. Today, their target is Temporary Protected Status. They are here to scapegoat and demonize people with TPS, to justify Trump and Miller’s decision to send a million people with legal status back to countries with extreme levels of armed conflict and other conditions.”

Ending TPS has thrown more than 1 million individuals into legal limbo—making people who have been lawfully present in the U.S. for decades suddenly undocumented and throwing their communities into chaos.

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon said: “In my district and across the country, Venezuelans, Haitians, Afghans and others living here under TPS status have had the rug pulled out from under them. TPS is a bipartisan program created by Congress, which allows people from countries facing war, unrest, natural disasters to stay in the U.S. until it’s safe to return.”

Rep. Deborah Ross said: “U.S. law permits TPS designation for nationals of a country when ongoing armed conflict poses a serious threat to their personal safety. I recently sent a letter(link is external) to the Administration with the Ranking Member calling out the hypocrisy of revoking TPS for South Sudan, a country plagued by armed clashes, with DHS claiming that there have been improvements in the civil safety outlook. But at the very same time, the Administration has designated South Sudan as a Level 4 travel advisory zone, ‘Do Not Travel,’ stating that the armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups.”

The Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant policies have already wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy.

Rep. García asked: “Do these raids at work sites make workers safer, or does it put them at risk?” Mr. Williams explained: “It puts them at extreme risk. And listen, you can’t work safely when you’re worried about being targeted for removal. You know, the truth is, people just won’t show up to work, which we’ve seen in North Carolina and Florida, where you have a disproportionate amount of TPS holders.”

Rep. Jasmine Crockett said: “We’re in the middle of the largest, most inhumane deportation program in American history. And guess what? Housing is still unaffordable. Health care is still too expensive. Groceries are still too expensive. Wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. Jobs are still being outsourced. So maybe it’s not the immigrants, maybe it's the failed Republican policies.”

Ranking Member Jayapal said: “TPS has also allowed hundreds of thousands of people to work legally, often in industries that are already experiencing severe labor shortages. These are folks working in construction, hospitality, food processing, and manufacturing—the kinds of jobs that keep our economy running and that many businesses are struggling to fill. They pay taxes, support local businesses, and contribute billions of dollars to our economy every single year. In all, TPS holders contribute about $21 billion annually to the U.S. economy, and they pay $5.2 billion in combined federal, payroll, state, and local taxes. They also contribute about $690 million annually to Social Security.”",,N,,2025-12-18 14:58:15.836480

Around 150,000 Sikhs drive trucks in the United States.
“This, in turn, inflames anti-immigrant bias towards immigrant truck drivers, especially Sikh drivers,” the filing said.
The job has long attracted immigrants hoping to earn a potentially substantial wage soon after arriving in the United States.
No studies have been conducted to show how many holders of non-domiciled licenses have been involved in crashes.","The Trump administration’s effort to reduce the number of accidents involving large trucks has taken aim at deficient truck driving schools and tightened a rule requiring that drivers are proficient in English.

But a major part of its trucking crackdown — a new emergency rule that prohibits certain classes of immigrants from obtaining truck driver’s licenses — has drawn fierce criticism and legal challenges. The moves are in line with the administration’s continued efforts to remove certain foreigners from the United States and bar others from entering.

The immigrants targeted by the new regulation are those in the United States as asylum seekers, refugees and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Previous policies allowed such immigrants to obtain a so-called non-domiciled commercial driver’s license if they were authorized to work in the United States.

The administration, citing recent fatal accidents, says these classes of immigrants can be dangerous drivers. But critics of the rule say the administration has not produced data showing that they are less safe.

“It doesn’t look believable to anyone in the industry when you accuse them of being unsafe,” said Al Bagiro, chief insurance officer at Cogo Insurance, a truck insurer, referring to the targeted drivers.

Other opponents of the new policy, which was stayed by a federal appeals court last month, say it discriminates against immigrants.

“The rule succeeds at perpetuating the myth that all immigrant drivers (regardless of their legal status) are unqualified or dangerous,” groups representing Sikhs in the United States argued in a legal filing opposing the rule. Around 150,000 Sikhs drive trucks in the United States.

“This, in turn, inflames anti-immigrant bias towards immigrant truck drivers, especially Sikh drivers,” the filing said.

Trucking can be a demanding job, often requiring that drivers be on the road for long periods. The job has long attracted immigrants hoping to earn a potentially substantial wage soon after arriving in the United States. Trucking companies, particularly smaller ones, have struggled financially in the last couple of years, with too many drivers chasing too little business.

Fatal crashes involving large trucks have declined in recent years. In the 12 months through September, there were 3,632, down 15 percent from 4,292 in the same period a year earlier, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the part of the Department of Transportation that regulates trucking and bus services.

No studies have been conducted to show how many holders of non-domiciled licenses have been involved in crashes.

In making the case for its crackdown, the Trump administration has highlighted fatal crashes involving semis driven by immigrants, contending that they should not have had truck driving licenses.

In August, a minivan on Florida’s turnpike crashed into a truck that was, according to the state’s department of highway safety, making an illegal U-turn. Three people in the minivan died. The driver of the truck, who survived the crash, obtained his commercial driver’s license in California and was, according to the Department of Homeland Security, in the United States illegally. To obtain a non-domiciled C.D.L., a person must have documentation to work in the United States.

The driver, Harjinder Singh, has pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular manslaughter, and a representative for Mr. Singh said he had authorization to work in the United States.

When the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration imposed the rule barring certain types of noncitizens from getting a non-domiciled commercial driver’s license, it said state licensing agencies could not check the driving histories of such applicants in their home country because they existed “predominantly or solely within a foreign jurisdiction.” The rule allows people in the United States on employment-based visas to get commercial driving licenses.

In a defeat for the Transportation Department, a federal appeals court last month stayed the rule, saying the safety administration did not appear to show that the regulations “would produce any net safety benefit.” The judges also noted that, when formulating the rule, the safety administration itself had said there was not sufficient evidence to show a measurable relationship between the nation of domicile of a commercial driver and “safety outcomes in the United States.”

The F.M.C.S.A. said that it was going to reissue the rule after reviewing public comments, and that it might be changed.

Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, has focused his criticisms about non-domiciled drivers on Democratic states like California and New York, saying federal audits of the states have shown that they issued licenses when they should not have. He has threatened to withhold tens of millions of dollars in federal funds from states if they do not overhaul their licensing operations.

California has since acknowledged that it issued some 17,000 non-domiciled driver’s licenses and learner permits that did not comply with regulations, but a spokeswoman for the California State Transportation Agency did not respond when asked for specifics. There are some 65,000 holders of non-domiciled licenses and permits in California.

And in response to Mr. Duffy’s accusation that it had unsafe licensing practices, California said truck drivers of all types licensed in the state had a lower rate of being involved in fatal crashes than those from most other states.

The California transport agency said drivers with C.D.L.s. issued in that state were involved in fatal accidents at a rate of 0.84 per 1,000 license holders in 2023.

Asked whether the Trump administration was overly focused on Democratic states and not applying sufficient scrutiny to red states like Texas, the Transportation Department spokeswoman said its policies were being applied evenly.

“The nationwide audit will continue until all illegally issued licenses are identified and the unqualified drivers are off America’s roads,” she said.

Of Texas’ 576,389 commercial drivers, 700 were involved in fatal crashes in 2023, or a rate of 1.21 crashes per 1,000 license holders, according to California’s data.

If the Trump administration’s policies end up removing thousands of drivers from the industry, it will not lead to the sort of driver shortage that would roil supply chains, logistics experts said.

“I don’t see a large impact on the industry with what I’ve seen thus far,” said Logan Cooper, a senior manager at OEC Group, an international logistics company.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/17/multimedia/00biz-truck-crackdown-01-qhml/00biz-truck-crackdown-01-qhml-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:58:23.947097

Federal agents have staged armed raids into apartment buildings, broken car windows to forcibly remove people and used chemical irritants on bystanders filming the actions.
“We’ve been told repeatedly that law enforcement cannot interfere with or assist ICE, yet we’ve seen ICE escort people out of the county jail and then detain them,” she said.
“When federal agents operate as if they are above the law, this is not law enforcement.
Rayfield told attendees that under Oregon law he is not allowed to give legal guidance to local law enforcement or local governments, but he said he has had conversations with local police leaders in many parts of the state.","Concerns over aggressive federal immigration enforcement dominated Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s final town hall of the year.

About 150 people attended Wednesday night’s event at Portland Community College’s Sylvania Campus, where Senate President Rob Wagner, a Lake Oswego Democrat who represents the area in the state Legislature, joined Rayfield.

Over the course of an hour, more than a dozen people stood up to ask the same question: What could the state do to hold federal immigration agents accountable for violating due process laws and using excessive force and to require agents to wear identification?

Many demanded the state issue guidance to local governments and police, ensuring people can call 911 and receive help if they are being unlawfully arrested, detained or treated.

Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agents in Oregon during the last three months, including parents dropping their kids at school and a high school student and U.S. citizen on his lunch break. Federal agents have staged armed raids into apartment buildings, broken car windows to forcibly remove people and used chemical irritants on bystanders filming the actions.

Former McMinnville Mayor Remy Drabkin told Wagner and Rayfield that despite Oregon’s sanctuary laws prohibiting local law enforcement from working with immigration officers, police are confused about where to draw the line and are not showing up when people call 911 for help.

“We’ve been told repeatedly that law enforcement cannot interfere with or assist ICE, yet we’ve seen ICE escort people out of the county jail and then detain them,” she said. “Our request would be that you release statewide guidance for law enforcement that the public can easily access and understand.”

Refugees and immigrants from Ukraine and Afghanistan discussed fear of going out in public for risk of being wrongfully targeted and detained by ICE officers.

“When federal agents operate as if they are above the law, this is not law enforcement. That is lawlessness,” said Abdul Hassan, board president of the nonprofit Community Empowerment Foundation in Portland, and an Afghan who formerly served as a language advisor to the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

“When lawlessness is tolerated under the excuse of immigration control, the rule of law itself is being undermined. Let me be very clear: public safety cannot be built on racial profiling, collective punishment and intimidation,” he said.

Wagner suggested lawmakers in the upcoming February legislative session would produce a framework for local governments and police to understand how they can protect Oregonians from ICE agents’ use of excessive force and to ensure the state’s sanctuary law is enforced.

Rayfield told attendees that under Oregon law he is not allowed to give legal guidance to local law enforcement or local governments, but he said he has had conversations with local police leaders in many parts of the state. He asked attendees to continue being the justice department’s eyes in Oregon, and to continue documenting misconduct and reporting it to the Oregon Department of Justice’s Sanctuary Promise Violations Hotline.

Rayfield and several Oregon district attorneys wrote in November to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that the state justice department would be monitoring federal agents’ conduct for potential prosecution.

And he recently told the Capital Chronicle that he was evaluating potential cases to refer to local prosecutors.

“It doesn’t matter who you are, whether you’re a law enforcement officer, whether you’re myself, whether you’re one of my family members or just a community member, all of us have to follow the laws of the state of Oregon, and that includes ICE officers as well,” Rayfield told reporters before the townhall. “There is certain immunity that is afforded to federal officers, but that immunity is not absolute, and so our responsibility here in Oregon is to make sure that people are following the law, investigating, monitoring and ensuring that when people are violating that law, that we are holding them accountable.”

Antonia Lopez of Aloha said she had hoped Rayfield and Wagner would have a more concrete plan to get local law enforcement to protect Oregonians from federal officers.

“There seems to be a disconnect in what the chiefs of police, the sheriffs, all of these people are saying about what they can’t do when ICE shows up” she said. “Can they give them direction as to what they can do? And they can start doing that?”

Lakanwal was admitted to the United States under Biden, and the Trump administration approved his asylum claim in April.
While investigators have not disclosed any motive for the attack, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said he was “radicalized” in the United States.
Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.)’s office did not respond to a request for comment about whether the New York Republican still supported the Enduring Welcome Act.","Until the shooting, GOP lawmakers had mostly worked to protect programs to aid Afghans seeking asylum from the larger Trump administration crackdown on foreign nationals in the United States. Now once-stalwart backers of programs for these Afghans are hedging their support and calling for changes to the vetting process. Some of those making the biggest reversals face voters in 2026.

“I’m sympathetic, obviously, to people who have helped America in the war effort, but all that support was predicated upon a rigorous vetting process, which I don’t have confidence in,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Cornyn, who faces two formidable primary challengers this year, helped write a 2021 law that updated the Special Immigrant Visa category for Afghans who helped the United States during the two decades America spent fighting Taliban insurgents in the country.

Asked his current stance on the SIV program, Cornyn said, “I don’t have any confidence in it” in light of the vetting issues.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has previously backed the resettlement of Afghan allies and condemned the Biden administration for inaction in helping Afghans, is also focusing on the need for reforms.

“We can be grateful President Trump is taking decisive action to strengthen vetting and prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again,” said Blackburn, who is retiring from the Senate and running for Tennessee governor, in a speech on the Senate floor.

It’s a stunning reversal of fortunes for the effort to help Afghans who aided the U.S., coming just weeks ahead of the end-of-year deadline for Congress to extend the deadline for Afghans to apply for Special Immigrant Visas. And it comes as advocates warn that there is an insufficient number of visas for the number of applicants waiting to enter the United States.

The U.S. admitted nearly 200,000 Afghan nationals in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Officials who served in the Biden administration have maintained that the U.S. did adequately vet and screen those who were admitted and that only a small number have encountered legal trouble since then.

Thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military and their families still wait at military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of SIVs. Military personnel at U.S. bases overseas typically conducted initial vetting of Afghans.

Republican leaders, said one congressional staffer, have “poisoned the Afghan allies conversation” even as a small bipartisan group of lawmakers tries to keep the efforts to help Afghans alive.

“Republicans want this debate to die,” the staffer added. The individual, like others, was granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations about the legislation.

Shawn VanDiver, head of a nonprofit called AfghanEvac that advocates for programs to help Afghans who aided the U.S., said he was shocked by House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to ax the provision reestablishing State’s Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts from the NDAA.

“Speaker Johnson has been good on this” previously, VanDiver said. “We expected the president to turn this into a circus … This is the president using a terrible tragedy to turn prejudice into policy.”

The plight of Afghans who helped U.S. forces has been one of few issues to unite Democrats and Republicans in Washington, even as Congress became more polarized. Congressional Democrats and Republicans joined forces during the Biden administration to increase the number of Special Immigrant Visas available to Afghans following the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of the country. Legislation to provide Afghans with a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residency has also enjoyed bipartisan co-sponsorships, though it has not become law.

Since the Nov. 26 shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members, which killed one service member and critically injured another, there’s been little appetite in Congress to increase the number of visas — let alone increase the legal pathways to citizenship — for Afghans.

The shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, served in an Afghan military unit with ties to the CIA. Lakanwal was admitted to the United States under Biden, and the Trump administration approved his asylum claim in April. While investigators have not disclosed any motive for the attack, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said he was “radicalized” in the United States. Republicans have seized on the issue to renew their attacks on the resettlement of Afghan refugees and the security screening process.

It has also become politically dangerous for Republicans up for reelection in the midterms to voice any support for the Afghan visa programs.

One of Cornyn’s primary challengers, Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas), has seized on his past support of the visa programs to portray his opponent as out of touch with voters. Hunt himself previously backed efforts to support Afghans who helped the U.S. in Afghanistan.

“When a senator from Texas takes 11 votes to support mass amnesty and then votes to accelerate Afghan SIV pathways, it doesn’t signal America First. It signals a bid for clout among Washington insiders,” Hunt’s campaign said in a statement.

Democrats and some Republicans have asked for caution. While the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees, they argue that thorough vetting still occurs.

“Individuals are already vetted through numerous interagency databases including through the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Counterterrorism Center,” a group of House Democrats led by Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) wrote in a Thursday letter to Trump and Noem.

Democrats are particularly incensed about the removal of the CARE office provision from the NDAA. That office, eliminated during a July overhaul of the State Department, was a hub across the U.S. government to process visas for, and manage the relocation and integration of, Afghans allowed into the United States.

Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored the original legislation to reauthorize State’s CARE office, said her Republican colleagues are turning their backs on Afghans.

“My colleagues need to grow a spine and stop letting Stephen Miller do their jobs, or else they will go down in history as betraying the very Afghans we promised we would never leave behind,” she said, referring to the Trump adviser who is seen as the main architect of the president’s immigration policy.

Johnson’s move dashed hopes that any legislation to help Afghans who supported the U.S. war effort could advance in this Congress.

“That was everyone’s hopes and dreams on this issue,” said a second congressional staffer. “It was literally authorizing the CARE office at State. If that’s dead, you can extrapolate that nothing more substantive on this is ever going to pass.”

Lawmakers have until Dec. 31 to decide whether to extend the SIV program. About 35,000 Afghans are approved to enter the United States, but fewer than 7,000 SIVs remain to be allocated, based on the numbers Congress authorized in previous years.

In the past, when the number of visas has come close to running out, Congress has increased the cap.

Another bipartisan bill, the Afghan Adjustment Act, would create a pathway for Afghans to obtain permanent residency and eventually U.S. citizenship. That bill already faced headwinds during both the Trump and Biden administrations given political opposition to immigration.

VanDiver said he wants lawmakers to use a discharge petition to bring the CARE office legislation and other bills to help Afghans to a vote in the House without Johnson’s approval. It is unclear whether such a petition will materialize before Congress adjourns for the holidays.

The Republican co-sponsors of the legislation to reestablish the CARE office have not commented on its removal from the NDAA. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.)’s office did not respond to a request for comment about whether the New York Republican still supported the Enduring Welcome Act.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) still backs the legislation — but he’s not running for reelection.

“The creed of the military is no man left behind,” McCaul said in an AfghanEvac video. ”And we promised them that we would protect them and yet we failed in that duty, in my judgment.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F06%2F40%2F52a2d09b4499a1b365885cf09d8f%2Fu-s-congress-67936.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:57:35.105958

An agreement between European Parliament and the European Council, or the group of the 27 EU heads of state, said that the countries would be considered safe if they lack “relevant circumstances, such as indiscriminate violence in the context of an armed conflict.”

Asylum requests by people from Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Kosovo, India, Morocco and Tunisia will be ""fast-tracked, with applicants having to prove that this provision should not apply to them,” read the announcement of the agreement. “The list can be expanded in the future under the EU’s ordinary legislative procedure.”

In 2024, EU nations endorsed sweeping reforms to the bloc’s failed asylum system. The rules were meant to resolve the issues that have divided the 27 countries since well over 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.

Under the Pact on Migration and Asylum, which goes into force in June 2026, people can be sent to countries deemed safe, but not to those where they face the risk of physical harm or persecution.

Amnesty International EU advocate Olivia Sundberg Diez said the new measures were “a shameless attempt to sidestep international legal obligations"" and would endanger migrants.

French MEP Mélissa Camara said the safe countries of origins concept and others agreed to by the Council and Parliament “opens the door to return hubs outside the EU’s borders, where third-country nationals are sometimes subjected to inhumane treatment with almost no monitoring” and “undoubtedly places thousands of people in exile in situations of danger.”

Céline Mias, the EU director of the Danish Refugee Council said that ""we are deeply worried that this fast-track system will fail to protect people in need of protection, including activists, journalists and marginalized groups in places where human rights are clearly under attack.”

Alessandro Ciriani, an Italian MEP with the European Conservatives and Reformists group, said the designation sends a firm message that the EU has toughened its borders.

“Just stop it,” Higgins told host Chris Cuomo.

“It’s bad for our economy, it’s horrifying for our families, and we cannot proceed this way as a nation.”

Since President Trump returned to office, the Department of Homeland Security has conducted operations in cities nationwide, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Charlotte, N.C.

Higgins, elected to lead the Magic City earlier this month, specifically criticized the administration for partnering with the Florida government in opening an immigrant detention facility in the Everglades.

The site, dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (R), opened in June. Trump visited the facility days later.

Through Oct. 15, more than 6,700 men entered the facility — 22 percent of whom were convicted of crimes more serious than non-DUI traffic offenses — according to NBC6 in South Florida.

More than 4 in 10 detainees had pending criminal charges, while more than 3 in 10 of the about 1,200 individuals held there on July 25 had a final order of removal, the news outlet added.

Amnesty International, a human rights organization, said last week that the use of a confined space called the “box” at the facility “constitutes torture.”

Additionally, Higgins, who defeated Republican Emilio González in the Miami mayoral race by nearly 20 points, has vowed to tackle high prices in the city. The cost of living in Miami is 21 percent higher than the national average, according to Payscale, a compensation software and data company.

Mayor Andrew Ginther, Police Chief Elaine Bryant, City Attorney Zach Klein and City Council President Shannon Hardin spoke at the address.

The Columbus Department of Public Safety released a video on Thursday addressing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city of Columbus.

The video features Ginther and Bryant.

""In light of the deployment of federal immigration and custom enforcement agents in our city, we understand that many of our neighbors may feel concerned for our safety,"" Ginther said. ""Please know that we stand with you and everyone who call Columbus home.""

Bryant added, ""Please know that CPD will not investigate Columbus residents solely based on immigration status. We will only investigate or apprehend someone if there is evidence of a crime or if there is illegal or dangerous conduct. CPD officers will be present to maintain public safety.""

During the press conference, Ginther said while some say the federal agents are in Columbus to make the city safer, he said the city is already safe.

The mayor points to lower number of homicides in recent years, with Ginther saying homicides are down 35% from last year and at the lowest point they've been in almost 20 years. He also said felonious assault cases are down 22%, non-fatal shootings are down 26%, car thefts are down 18% and felony theft is down 11%.

""These statistics are important because they show our city is the safest its been in years and they paint a picture of trust between Columbus residents and law enforcement is the strongest it's been in some time,"" Ginther said.

Bryant said Columbus is a diverse and welcoming city.

""We do not want our neighbors living in fear. We don't want anyone in our community calling the police in a time of need. That does not serve public safety,"" Bryant said.

The police chief said the department's mission is to maintain and public safety for everyone in the community.

Klein issued the following statement:

""I am aware of reports that federal law enforcement officials, including ICE, are currently engaged in active operations in Columbus. I know this causes alarm and concern. Please know that the Columbus Division of Police is not involved in these sorts of immigration enforcement activities. CPD's role is public safety, not immigration enforcement. Our officers do not inquire about immigration status when folks call for help and do not aid federal immigration operations, as has been the case under this and every other presidential administration.

If anyone witnesses concerning activity, do not intervene directly or put yourself at risk. If the action is criminal in nature, always trust that you can call Columbus Police. They will respond. Additionally, sharing accurate information and looking out for one another is one of the most powerful ways our community can respond.

Lastly, we know many of our immigrant families, friends and neighbors are feeling anxious and afraid. You are all valued members of our city, and we're fully committed to your safety. Know that leaders at City Hall have your back and continue to monitor the situation on the ground.""

Hardin posted on Facebook, stating that ""we know ICE is in Columbus.""

The PROTECT Immigration Act would: Repeal the statutory authority for the 287(g) Program; and Clarify that state and local law enforcement lack “inherent authority” to arrest people for suspected immigration offenses.","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Mike Quigley (IL-05), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Sarah McBride (DE-At Large), and Valerie Foushee (NC-04) re-introduced the Protecting the Rights of Towns against federal Enforcement contrary to Constitutional Tenets for (PROTECT) Immigration Act, legislation which would end the deputization of local and state police departments to enforce immigration law. The PROTECT Immigration Act would rescind the statutory authority for the federal government’s 287(g) Program, which allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law.

“The Trump administration just spent months terrorizing immigrants in the Chicagoland area. Their actions led to domestic violence victims fleeing a courthouse rather than receive restraining orders against their abusers, all out of fear that ICE or local law enforcement would detain and deport them,” said Representative Mike Quigley (IL-05). “I met with immigrants and their neighbors who are afraid to call for help or report crimes in their neighborhoods because of Trump’s deliberate erosion of trust between communities and local police. And now the Trump administration is running ads targeting local police and offering $50,000 signing bonuses to pull critical law enforcement away from day-to-day policing in order to arrest and detain hardworking immigrants with no criminal records. We must bring an end to the 287(g) program and cut off one of the avenues this administration has exploited to intimidate immigrant communities.”

“Allowing local law enforcement to be deputized to kidnap and disappear immigrants undercuts the trust that local police rely on to maintain public safety in our communities,” said Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07). “Immigrants and their U.S. citizen loved ones stop reporting crimes out of fear of being kidnapped and deported. Local police are spread thin enforcing federal civil immigration law. We know that Trump is not targeting criminals, he is targeting our friends, neighbors, co-workers, and pillars of our community. This lawlessness must end immediately.”

“I’m proud to co-lead this legislation with Congressman Quigley to restore trust, safety, and integrity to our immigration system. For too long, the 287(g) program has drained local resources, fueled racial profiling, and made communities less safe — and it’s time we end it. The PROTECT Immigration Act makes clear that immigration enforcement belongs with trained federal authorities, guaranteeing that local law enforcement can focus exclusively on keeping our communities safe. This bill would take a step toward restoring trust between local communities and police departments so every family can live with dignity and without fear,” said Representative Sarah McBride (DE-At Large).

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to expand the 287(g) Program is a direct assault on civil rights and the Constitution,” said Representative Valerie Foushee (NC-04). “Having served in local law enforcement for more than 20 years, I know policing should protect and support our communities, not divide it, and deputizing local officers into immigration enforcers only erodes public trust, undermines public safety, and deepens fear. We need laws in place that restore fairness and uphold justice. That’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing the PROTECT Immigration Act, which will reverse this harmful program and take an important step toward repairing the flaws in our broken immigration system.”

“In just one year, the Trump administration has massively expanded the 287(g) program and distorted it in ways Congress never intended, exploiting local law enforcement resources for its dystopian mass deportation agenda,” said Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs for the ACLU’s Equality Division. “Enlisting local law enforcement for mass deportations isn’t just a waste of taxpayer dollars – it terrorizes our communities, undermines public safety and fuels racial profiling. We thank Congressman Quigley for his leadership and urge our members of Congress to pass the PROTECT Immigration Act without delay.”

“The rapid expansion of the 287(g) program under the Trump administration represents yet another way that mass deportation undermines public safety for all Americans. When local police serve as a force multiplier for ICE, people become more afraid to report crime and less trusting of local police officers. Local law enforcement agencies should prioritize real public safety concerns in their communities rather than waste limited manpower making traffic stops that turn into detention and deportation for long-standing community members who pose no threat. The PROTECT Act takes the overdue step of repealing a program that is unnecessary for effective enforcement of immigration laws, but continues to have a harmful track record for public safety,” said Nayna Gupta, Policy Director at the American Immigration Council.

Quigley has championed the PROTECT Immigration Act since 2017.

This was about going after the Republican party and most importantly it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Jordan told Fox News’s Fox and Friends.
Smith has said his prosecutors followed justice department policy and were not influenced by politics.
“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election,” Smith said.
“I didn’t choose those Members; President Trump did.”","Jack Smith, the former US justice department special counsel who brought two now-dropped criminal cases against Donald Trump, has defended his investigation before a House of Representatives panel, telling lawmakers that the basis for the prosecutions “rests entirely with President Trump and his actions”.

Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House judiciary committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the justice department, and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s investigation and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system.

Smith and his team secured indictments in 2023, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Smith dropped both cases after Trump won the 2024 election, citing a justice department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether the president was a Republican or Democrat,” Smith told the committee, according to excerpts from his opening statement seen by Reuters.

His appearance at the Capitol came after the Republican chair of the House judiciary committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, subpoenaed Smith for a closed-door deposition. Smith had requested a public hearing.

“This was political. This was about going after the Republican party and most importantly it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Jordan told Fox News’s Fox and Friends.

Speaking to reporters outside the interview room, Democratic lawmakers said Smith’s testimony should have been conducted in public. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the panel’s top Democrat, said a public hearing would have been “absolutely devastating to the president”.

“He’s answered every single question to the satisfaction of any reasonable-minded person in that room,” Raskin said.

Democratic depresentative, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, said Smith told lawmakers that Trump’s conduct in seeking to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, could have been “catastrophic” for the US democracy.

Republican lawmakers have expressed outrage at disclosures from the justice department that investigators sought information from a wide range of conservative organizations as part of the investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and also obtained limited cellphone data from eight Republican senators during the period around the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.

Trump allies have pointed to those disclosures as evidence that Smith’s investigation was overzealous and targeted the political opposition.

Smith has said his prosecutors followed justice department policy and were not influenced by politics. He told lawmakers in his opening statement that the records were “relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.

From Trump’s unprecedented moves to expand domestic military operations and cut funding to public media, to the targeting of immigrant families and activists like Mahmoud Khalil, these stories reveal a society grappling with the consequences of abuse of power, political retaliation, and discrimination. Our work explaining Trump’s executive orders undermining protections for transgender people, and revealing how immigrant parents pushed back against Donald Trump’s attacks on birthright citizenship show our communities actively fighting for their rights.

These stories are not just headlines; they are evidence of the forces threatening democracy, free speech, and human dignity. They also show the resilience of individuals and advocates pushing back. Together, they offer a snapshot of the issues defining 2025 and the ongoing fight for justice.

Trump 2.0 and Abuse of Power

Starting mere hours after he was sworn in, Trump’s dangerous abuse of power threatens core democratic principles and civil liberties. These stories show how his expanded domestic deployment of the military and his attacks on press freedom risk silencing dissent and put vulnerable communities at risk.

Trump's Expanded Domestic Military Use Should Worry Us All

Starting in January, we sounded the alarm that military troops do not belong on our streets and should not be used to police civilians here at home. Since he took office, President Donald Trump has deployed military troops and federal agents in cities across the country in an effort to scare our communities, target political opponents and intimidate those who protest his policies.

This is all part of a continued effort by President Trump to abuse his power and deploy federal agents and military troops anywhere he wants, against whoever he wants. Cities and communities have pushed back, joining the ACLU and our partners to stop our neighborhoods from becoming places where people feel afraid to leave their homes.

What Happens Next: Courts have so far blocked the Trump administration’s attempts to federalize state National Guard troops and deploy them to multiple cities, including Portland and Chicago. But the government has now asked the Supreme Court to affirm its attempt to federalize and deploy troops to Chicago. The ACLU continues to urge both the courts and Congress to block these deployments and hold the Trump administration accountable for any abuses that stem from these activations.

Trump's Attacks on Press Freedom Escalate: NPR, PBS Funding Cuts Explained

Trump’s efforts to defund NPR and PBS were a historic assault on press freedom. In a May 2025 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media,” Trump directed agencies to cut both direct and indirect federal funding to these public media outlets, accusing them of biased reporting. In response, NPR and several local stations filed a lawsuit, arguing that the order violates the First Amendment by retaliating against them for their editorial choices. The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support.

What Happens Next: These lawsuits, and the fight for press freedom, is ongoing.

Safeguarding Immigration and Speech Rights

Trump’s immigration policies violate constitutional protections and basic human rights. Key concerns include threats to birthright citizenship, as well as the detention and deportation of individuals for political advocacy.

A Letter From Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil

Our client, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil wrote a powerful letter to his newborn son from an immigration detention center in Louisiana, where he was held for three months after ICE arrested him without a warrant in retaliation for his protected speech. In his letter, he appeals to students, advocates, and elected officials to defend the right to protest — framing his case not just as personal persecution but as part of a broader attack on immigrants, the rule of law, and people who spoke out in support of Palestinian human rights.

What Happens Next: Khalil was released from detention in June 2025 after a federal judge ordered his release and blocked the administration from deporting him as the case proceeds. His immigration case and his lawsuit challenging his unconstitutional detention are both ongoing.

‘My Child is Now a Political Debate’: Immigrant Families Battle Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Threats

Across the country, iImmigrant parents—many of whom have U.S.-born children—had to confront the reality that their own kids could be treated like political bargaining chips. The ACLU represented several families in their lawsuit against the Trump administration's unlawful executive order targeting birthright citizenship. They told us that revoking citizenship for children born in the U.S. was not only terrifying, but a violation of their constitutional rights.

What Happens Next: The Supreme Court announced in December that it will hear our case challenging Trump’s attempt to deny birthright citizenship to babies born in the U.S. We’re prepared to remind the court that the administration’s attempt to end birthright citizenship is a direct violation of the 14th Amendment.

Protecting Our Communities and Ourselves

Trump’s unlawful policies targeting transgender people endanger safety, compromise health, and strip transgender and intersex people of dignity and autonomy. We continue to challenge these actions in court

Trump's Executive Orders Promoting Sex Discrimination, Explained

In January, Trump’s executive orders targeting transgender people ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Department of Homeland Security to force transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers, ignoring safety guidelines, and withdraw medically-necessary care, putting more than 2,000 incarcerated trans people at high risk of abuse. The order also blocked transgender and intersex people from updating sex markers on new passports, visas, and trusted traveler documents, effectively outing them and limiting their ability to travel.

What Happens Next: The Supreme Court allowed the government to enforce a discriminatory passport policy against transgender people.

For such entities, the absence of California-specific targeting may no longer bar suit in California if the alleged data extraction from Californians is part of the platform’s designed operations.
Given the legislative standstill on CIPA, the litigation environment will remain active and uncertain through at least 2026.","The past year has seen sweeping developments in personal jurisdiction doctrine as applied to online privacy litigation, particularly in California. In April 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Briskin v. Shopify, Inc.1 recalibrated the specific-jurisdiction analysis for nationwide e-commerce platforms accused of harvesting and monetizing consumer data, expressly rejecting any requirement of “differential targeting” of the forum. In the months that followed, however, two California district courts—addressing suits against a hotel holding company2 and a Georgia retailer3—dismissed privacy claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, underscoring the continuing burden on plaintiffs to connect alleged data practices to defendants’ own, forum-directed conduct. Meanwhile, Sacramento has put on ice a legislative effort (SB 690)4 to narrow the scope of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), ensuring that current litigation dynamics will persist at least through 2026. Together, these crosscurrents define a more nuanced and fact-intensive landscape for companies that sell online, deploy tracking technologies, or publish omnibus privacy statements.

Briskin’s Reframing: Purposeful Direction Without ‘Differential Targeting’

In Briskin, the Ninth Circuit revived a putative privacy class action against Shopify, holding that the plaintiff made a prima facie showing of specific jurisdiction in California.5 The complaint alleged that Shopify’s platform installed tracking tools, intercepted communications, and extracted personal and transactional data from California consumers, using the data for Shopify’s own commercial benefit.6 The court held that such conduct—designed into the platform’s business model—constituted purposeful direction at California even though Shopify cultivated a nationwide audience.7 Crucially, the en banc court overruled prior circuit precedent to the extent it demanded “differential targeting” of the forum, clarifying that an interactive platform “expressly aims” conduct at a state when the relevant contacts are the product of the defendant’s own choices and are not random, isolated, or fortuitous.8 The court also concluded the claims “arose out of or related to” those forum contacts and that the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable given California’s interest in protecting resident privacy and the efficiencies of litigating where the alleged data extraction occurred.9

Briskin thus lowers a doctrinal hurdle that had often shielded nationwide platforms: plaintiffs need not show that a defendant singled out California with bespoke marketing or state-specific features if the business model itself predictably and deliberately extracts Californians’ data for commercial gain. At the same time, Briskin did not dispense with the requirement that jurisdiction be anchored in the defendant’s own forum contacts—not those of third parties—and that the alleged harms relate to those contacts.

District Courts Draw Lines: Passive Policies, Third-Party Scripts, and General Online Sales Are Not Enough

Two subsequent district court rulings illustrate the remaining limits of specific jurisdiction where the defendant’s own California-directed conduct is thin.

First, in a Northern District of California case against a hotel holding company, the court granted a Rule 12(b)(2) motion and dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.10 Plaintiffs alleged the company operated a website facilitating shopping for and leasing rooms in California and pointed to a global privacy statement referencing California law and opt-out rights.11 The court credited an uncontested declaration establishing that the holding company did not itself operate hotels or maintain a California presence and emphasized that the complaint alleged data collection via third-party scripts on the website, not by the defendant itself.12 Distinguishing Briskin, the court found no allegations that the defendant targeted California consumers or compiled their data for its own use; nor would a general, globally accessible privacy statement, standing alone, create jurisdiction in every state where it is read.13 The dismissal was with leave to amend, but the court warned that failure to cure the jurisdictional defects could lead to dismissal without further leave.

Next, the Central District of California dismissed with prejudice a CIPA “trap and trace” action against a Georgia-based e‑commerce retailer.14 The plaintiff alleged the retailer installed TikTok’s software on its website, which collected and transmitted visitor data (including device and geolocation information) to TikTok.15 Despite amended allegations that the retailer sells and ships to California, the court held there was no express aiming at California and no showing that the plaintiff’s injury arose out of California‑focused conduct by the retailer itself.16 The court again distinguished Briskin, explaining that the defendant was not a nationwide platform cultivating a ubiquitous audience for commercial gain and that the forum contacts of a third-party technology provider (TikTok) could not be imputed to the retailer.17 Because the plaintiff failed to satisfy either of the first two prongs of the Ninth Circuit’s specific-jurisdiction test, the case was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.

Read together, these decisions signal that Briskin is not a jurisdictional panacea. Plaintiffs must still plausibly allege that the defendant’s own business choices foreseeably involved extracting or exploiting data from California users and that their claims arise out of those contacts. Passive website features, generalized privacy statements that acknowledge California law, routine interstate sales and shipping, and the mere incorporation of third-party code will not, without more, establish specific jurisdiction.

Legislative Stasis: CIPA Reform Deferred, Litigation Continues

In parallel, California’s attempt to cabin CIPA exposure has stalled. SB 690—introduced to add a “commercial purpose” exception to several CIPA provisions (including Sections 631, 632, and 638.50)—passed the Senate 35–0 but failed to advance in the Assembly and has been reclassified as a two-year bill.18 The earliest it could be reconsidered is 2026, with no effect before 2027 even if enacted. The bill would have clarified that routine website practices such as session replay, chat support, and third‑party analytics do not amount to unlawful wiretapping or eavesdropping when employed for legitimate commercial purposes. With reform delayed, businesses remain exposed to continuing CIPA litigation and statutory damages of $5,000 per violation amid inconsistent judicial interpretations, as reflected in recent appellate activity involving website tracking and chat technologies.

Practical Implications for Online Businesses

The immediate takeaway is twofold. First, Briskin expands potential jurisdictional exposure for platforms whose business models inherently rely on the collection and commercialization of consumer data across state lines, including California. For such entities, the absence of California-specific targeting may no longer bar suit in California if the alleged data extraction from Californians is part of the platform’s designed operations. Second, for traditional retailers and brand owners that merely operate an online storefront, ship to California, and implement off‑the‑shelf tracking pixels or SDKs19 provided by third parties, the recent district court dismissals demonstrate that specific jurisdiction in California remains contestable—often successfully—unless plaintiffs can tie their privacy claims to the defendant’s own forum-directed conduct.

Given the legislative standstill on CIPA, the litigation environment will remain active and uncertain through at least 2026. Companies should expect continued, early-stage battles over personal jurisdiction, with outcomes turning on the specificity of pleadings concerning a defendant’s business choices, the locus of any alleged data extraction, and the relationship between those contacts and the asserted harms. Briskin has shifted the center of gravity, but it has not erased the boundaries between nationwide platforms that deliberately harvest data from Californians and out‑of‑state retailers whose incidental California web traffic and generalized privacy policies, without more, do not constitute purposeful direction.

The US-born pope chose 58-year-old Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, to lead the church in New York, replacing retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan who has served for 16 years after being selected by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.

Dolan is regarded as a conservative figure in the US Catholic church hierarchy. Hicks takes on the role of cardinal after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300m fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had brought legal action against the archdiocese.

Hicks addressed the issue at news conference on Thursday.

“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it’s difficult, it’s painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”

Notably, Leo and the US hierarchy have shown willingness to challenge the administration on its immigration policies. In October, Leo questioned whether the policies were in line with the Catholic church’s “pro-life” teachings and described them as “inhuman”.

Hicks, 58, grew up in South Holland, Illinois, close to the Chicago childhood home of Leo, the former Robert Prevost. Both men served the church abroad: Leo spending 20 years as a missionary in Peru; Hicks spent five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage.

Last month, Hicks endorsed a special message from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration’s immigration raids. The bishops said they “are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants”.

Hicks said the message expressed “our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters” and underlined their “concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction”.

Leo and Hicks only met last year, when the provost and bishop visited one of Hicks’s parishes, according to CNN. Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV after Leo was elected pope that he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities.

“We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighborhood together. We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places,” he said.

Hicks was born on 4 August 1967, in Harvey, Illinois, and received degrees in philosophy, divinity and ministry. He was ordained to the priesthood for the archdiocese of Chicago in 1994, according to the New York archdiocese.

In 2005, he moved from Chicago to El Salvador to begin his five-year term as regional director of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) in Central America. NPH is a home dedicated to caring for more than 3,400 orphaned and abandoned children in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries.

He returned to Chicago and in 2020 Pope Francis named him Bishop Hicks as the sixth bishop of the Catholic diocese of Joliet, Illinois, serving about 520,000 Catholics in seven counties. Hicks will now serve roughly 2.5 million Catholics in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City (Brooklyn and Queens are part of the Brooklyn archdiocese).","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88bada2c2a114a29acb5981d07b91062bd6de539/260_0_4179_3342/master/4179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06a7f95212b4a296a2cdc6fdb467a1be",N,,2025-12-18 14:58:31.406136

WASHINGTON — Heading into the new year, immigrants’ rights and civil rights advocates are busy preparing for Supreme Court arguments, expected in the spring, in a case challenging President Trump’s unprecedented birthright citizenship executive order that seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to many babies born in the United States. Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and a second-generation American, will argue this landmark case, Trump v. Barbara, at the Supreme Court.

An ACLU lawyer for more than two decades, Wang has played a central role in shaping the organization’s civil rights and constitutional litigation. Under her leadership during the first Trump administration, the ACLU challenged the Muslim ban, family separation policy, illegal funding of border wall projects Congress had rejected, and attempts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

Earlier in her career, she directed the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, which won cases involving immigration detention, racial profiling, and discriminatory state and federal immigration laws. As a second-generation American, her own citizenship was made possible by the repeal of racially discriminatory immigration laws through the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and by the 14th Amendment’s birthright citizenship guarantee. Those reforms grew directly out of the anti-slavery and civil rights movements and expanded who has citizenship and belonging in the United States.

“This is the case of the century — the stakes are unfathomably high. Can a president of the United States unilaterally end birthright citizenship by executive order — overriding more than 150 years of settled constitutional law, and redefining who is recognized as American at birth? Absolutely not,” said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. “Cecillia Wang is one of the country’s great litigators, which is why she’s the ACLU’s top lawyer. She has decades of experience fighting government overreach, including two trial victories against Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s racial profiling and contempt of court. Now, she’s up against a more formidable adversary as this case is a linchpin to Donald Trump and Stephen Miller’s agenda. Our clients are in the best possible hands with Cecillia Wang and this incredible co-counsel team presenting arguments — they will do all it takes to make sure birthright citizenship remains a cornerstone of our democracy.”

The Barbara case is a nationwide class action brought by the national ACLU, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, the Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus, and Democracy Defenders Fund on behalf of babies who would be subject to the executive order.

This summer, the federal court in the Barbara case granted a preliminary injunction that protects birthright citizenship for all children born on U.S. soil, prompting the Trump administration’s appeal to the Supreme Court.

Courts have uniformly rejected President Trump’s attempts to strip away a core constitutional protection and blocked his birthright citizenship executive order.

The groups will argue that the administration’s assault on birthright citizenship — the legal principle guaranteed by the 14th Amendment that every baby born in the United States is a U.S. citizen — flouts the Constitution’s dictates, longstanding Supreme Court precedent, a statute passed by Congress, and fundamental American values.",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:57:49.145672

Our reporting reveals how federal agencies moved them through the Trump administration’s expanded network of detention facilities — many rife with complaints of inhumane conditions.

The analysis of recently released Immigration and Customs Enforcement data found that Illinois saw the sharpest increase in ICE arrests of any U.S. state in the first five weeks after the blitz began. And those who were arrested were quickly shuttled to a sprawling array of detention facilities that cut a wide swath down the middle of the country.

When federal agents launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, they arrested thousands of people, at times near schools or child care centers, and used chemical agents like tear gas on protesters. In response to the often chaotic and high-profile raids, city residents blew whistles to alert neighbors of approaching agents and organized “magic school buses” to accompany children to school.

The Marshall Project analyzed ICE data that includes arrests and detentions through the middle of October, the most current detailed records publicly available. People who ICE arrested during that time were later detained in 13 states, at county jails, privately run detention centers and a rapidly constructed facility on a military base, the data shows.

“Without that infrastructure, without mass detention, you can’t carry out mass raids or mass deportation,” said Stacy Suh, program director at Detention Watch Network, a coalition of grassroots organizations that seeks to end immigration detention.

The ICE data, obtained by the Deportation Data Project, allowed The Marshall Project to trace individuals as they were transferred between facilities, and in some cases, deported.

President Donald Trump has rapidly ramped up immigration arrests in an attempt to deport 1 million people in his first year back in office. At the same time, a new Department of Homeland Security policy denies detainees the right to bond hearings in immigration court, leading the number of people in detention to reach record-highs.

Examining the records of people who were arrested in the Chicago area, The Marshall Project found that nearly all of them were first held at a facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb west of the city. In November, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order compelling ICE to address conditions there.

The order cites “serious conditions” at the facility, similar to those reported at detention centers across the nation, and requires ICE to provide access to sleeping space, bedding, toiletries, medication, regularly cleaned areas, regular meals, telephone calls and clear information about paperwork the government asks detainees to sign.

The suburban facility, which has been the site of a lot of protests against the immigration raids, was the first stop for many who were arrested off the street as federal agents moved through the region. Dayanne Figueroa, a U.S. citizen who was pulled from her SUV by federal agents in a Chicago neighborhood, was detained at the Broadview facility. Figueroa, who was recovering from kidney surgeries when she was taken to Broadview, told Congress that she “begged for help” but was ignored by agents and “thrown into a filthy jail cell,” until blood in her urine prompted them to get her medical care.

After being booked into ICE custody, more than 380 people arrested in the Chicago area were transported to a recently revived detention facility in the rural town of Baldwin, Michigan. The facility, North Lake Processing Center, tops the list of places where the most people were held in the first weeks of the Operation Midway Blitz raids.

North Lake, which is run by GEO Group, was previously a federal prison until the Biden administration ended Department of Justice contracts with private prison companies. It reopened in June under a new contract with the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest.

Nahomi Ramirez, whose father is detained there, said North Lake still looks and feels like the prison it once was.

“It’s concrete walls, it’s barbed wire fences everywhere, like for no one to escape,” Ramirez said. “I haven’t even fully processed that in my brain, to be honest.”

Ramirez’s father, a semitruck driver arrested in Indiana, told her he was moved to a freezing-cold, filthy ward with other people who have diabetes. The detainees in the ward were not always fed on time, which caused their blood sugar to crash, Ramirez said, and her father’s allergy to the blankets in his room has left him huddling under his jacket for warmth.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has reported receiving similar complaints from North Lake detainees about inadequate food, lack of medical care and freezing temperatures, as well as visitation issues, lack of access to legal counsel and suicide attempts. The concerns prompted her to visit the facility.

Since Trump’s second term began, more privately run immigration facilities have opened, or reopened, around the U.S. to keep up with the pace of raids and detentions. Meanwhile, advocates have warned of inhumane conditions for detainees.

Eighteen people, more than half of them children, arrested in the Chicago area were transferred to the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, run by CoreCivic. President Joe Biden ended the practice of detaining children with their families in 2021, but Trump recently reversed that policy and resumed operations.

Families at Dilley have testified in court filings to troubling conditions, including worms and mold in food and little access to education or recreation for children. They said their children were so distressed that they had hit their own faces and soiled themselves, despite being potty-trained.

In 2021, Illinois banned local jails from supplying detention space to ICE, leaving the agency to rely on neighboring states instead.

At least 300 people from the Chicago raids went through the Clay County Justice Center in Indiana, a jail that has long relied on federal detention contracts to supplement the county budget. After a heated public debate, Clay County opened up a new, 285-bed wing last year to house immigrants. ICE book-ins at the jail nearly tripled in the first half of the year, according to the IndyStar.

As a part of a lawsuit filed in 2022, attorneys for detainees claim the jail wrongfully passed inspection in violation of ICE standards and that ICE’s lack of oversight has allowed the county to misappropriate funds meant for the care and custody of people detained.

Robin Valenzuela, co-founder of Indiana AID, which supports immigrants detained in the state, said even with the expansion, the Clay County facility is overcrowded. People have developed infections from sleeping on floors, she said, and are not being provided with enough hygiene products during menstruation.

The conditions and the indefinitely long stays in detention have led many detainees to sign “voluntary departure” agreements to leave the U.S., she said.

“This whole thing is about deterrence,” Valenzuela said. “So it’s like, how can we make people as miserable as possible in these facilities so that they just say, ‘Screw it, I want to leave.’”

Other counties in Indiana are also cashing in on federal contracts. Immigration detention expanded to four more Indiana county jails this year, according to an analysis from the National Immigrant Justice Center. Data shows Marion County Jail in Indianapolis held at least 42 people arrested in the Chicago raids.

Noelle Smart, principal research associate at the Vera Institute of Justice, said ICE significantly expanded its jail contracts as the agency ramps up enforcement, and that it is increasingly relying on transfers to out-of-state facilities, particularly when it lacks detention space nearby.

A new Texas detention center, mostly composed of gigantic tents, is an archetype for the kinds of large facilities the Trump administration plans to continue building. More than 50 people arrested around Chicago during the federal enforcement blitz were last held at Camp East Montana before they were deported. The grounds, located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, began holding immigrants in August, before its construction was finished.

More than 100 Chicago detainees remained there in mid-October. By the end of November, the camp hit an average daily population of over 2,700.

In the few months that it has been operational, the camp has been the subject of reports of abuse and dangerous conditions. In September, The Washington Post reported that an internal ICE inspection report showed it failed to meet at least 60 detention standards.

This month, civil rights groups sent a letter to federal officials detailing abuses based on interviews with dozens of people detained at Fort Bliss. The letter claimed federal officers used threats of violence in an attempt to force detainees to cross the border into Mexico, despite having migrated from Cuba. The letter also details reports of sexual abuse, toilets overflowing into sleeping areas, and detainees being denied access to medication and adequate food.

The family of Victor Miranda, a landscaper from the South Side of Chicago arrested during the blitz, said his medical conditions worsened after his transfer to Fort Bliss. Miranda’s 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, said her father has not had proper meals or been given the breathing equipment he uses to sleep.

“They keep calling them criminals, and they tell them there that the lawyers aren’t going to do anything for them,” said Ashley, translating for her mother, who speaks Spanish. “That you have no chance, you should just give up.”

Miranda is one of hundreds of people detained during the Chicago raids who were allegedly arrested by ICE without warrants.

On Dec. 11, a federal appeals court blocked the collective release of people arrested without warrants in Illinois and other states covered by a consent decree — but said a judge could review individual cases to determine who should be freed. If the Trump administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, that could create more obstacles and delays.

In the meantime, Chicago residents and community organizations are readying themselves for more raids and arrests with the return of the federal blitz.

Erin Tobes, a stay-at-home mother in the Bowmanville neighborhood, launched a mutual aid committee with other mothers that organized rapid response tactics during the first spate of raids. The group continues to support families of people detained and deported by creating GoFundMes, coordinating legal representation and providing staples like diapers and food.

“I’m proud to be able to put that forward and let my kids know that I’m out there working with the community,” Tobes said. “And that they are safe, their friends are safe, and we’re going to do everything we can to help them.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/G4nAcc2_vHHho7aZSCi_-7i-TVKGam7WkLOAU3703GE/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC82ajZ1Mm44eXM2/ZDJ3YmV6Z2oxMW11/NmZmcDF2LzI1MTIx/OF9BUF9BR3JheV9N/SURXQVktTlVNQkVS/Uy5qcGc,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:14.469484

Most were state or federal prisons, though some had been ICE detention centers.
In Texas this year, the private prison company CoreCivic reopened a shuttered ICE detention center in Dilley.
During COVID, prisoners there held hunger strikes, alleging inadequate food and medical care, and a vindictive use of solitary confinement.
It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" the spokesperson added.","There are empty prison buildings all over the country. They shut down for a variety of reasons: staffing issues, allegations of abuse, even simply that there are fewer people in prison today than a few decades ago. Some prisons have sat vacant for years.

But the Trump administration is now holding more than 65,000 people in immigration detention — the highest level in history, and that has created huge demand for these properties.

""There's definitely been this pattern over the last nine months of the Trump administration looking to shuttered state prisons, shuttered former federal prisons as a way to quickly expand ICE detention,"" says Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, a non-profit seeking to end immigration detention.

She says this trend isn't new, but President Trump's immigration crackdown has accelerated the pace. That worries Ghandehari: Many of these prisons faced allegations of poor conditions while they were open, and they're reopening at a time when the government has cut oversight measures.

""A lot of them have a long history of really deplorable conditions. And a lot of times, they shut down only to reopen and detain a different population. It's just this continual cycle and conditions never get better,"" Ghandehari added.

NPR identified at least 16 shuttered facilities across a dozen states that have reopened as Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers since President Trump took office in January. Most were state or federal prisons, though some had been ICE detention centers. Almost all the properties were owned or operated by private prison companies, and many had a troubled past.

In Texas this year, the private prison company CoreCivic reopened a shuttered ICE detention center in Dilley. In 2017, immigrants there reported poor conditions, such as a lack of clean water and inadequate medical care. In 2024, the facility closed. Today, a lawsuit alleges much of the same.

""Our facilities are subject to multiple layers of oversight and are monitored very closely by our government partners to ensure full compliance with policies and procedures, including any applicable detention standards,"" Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, told NPR in a statement.

In Georgia this year, ICE reopened the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla. That facility, previously an ICE detention center managed by the private prison company LaSalle Corrections, had closed in 2021 amid allegations of medical abuse against the women held there, according to a bipartisan Senate investigation.

And in Michigan, the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, owned by the private prison company GEO Group, has closed and reopened several times over the last few decades.

In the late nineties, North Lake was a juvenile detention facility. The University of Michigan documented allegations of understaffing, medical neglect and abuse during that time.

Later, it became a federal prison. During COVID, prisoners there held hunger strikes, alleging inadequate food and medical care, and a vindictive use of solitary confinement.

It closed in 2022 after the Biden administration banned privately-owned prisons in the federal system. But this past June, North Lake opened again — this time, as an ICE facility.

""There are all these echoes of past injustices and so much of what we're hearing right now from people held there is exactly the same,"" says JR Martin, a member of the advocacy group No Detention Centers in Michigan.

Jose Contreras Cervantes was detained at North Lake this fall. He was arrested during a traffic stop on suspicion of being in the U.S. without authorization. Contreras Cervantes has a wife and three young children, and he also has Leukemia.

He says he told officials he was taking oral chemotherapy pills. But for nearly a month, he says he did not receive them, according to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Michigan. When the chemotherapy pills did start coming, they were inconsistent, and sometimes he wouldn't receive his nausea pills, so he would vomit up the chemo regimen. He worried his cancer would spread.

""Every minute, every second that went by felt like a ticking clock to me,"" Contreras Cervantes told NPR in Spanish.

A spokesperson for GEO Group told NPR in a statement that they act in compliance with federal detention standards and that their services are monitored by the federal government.

""We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" the spokesperson said. ""The support services GEO provides include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.""

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, told NPR that any claims of poor conditions at North Lake are false, and that all detainees have access to medical care.

""At no time during ICE detention is an alien denied emergent care. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" the spokesperson added. ""This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.""

Yet the allegations made by Contreras Cervantes do not surprise Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU's National Prison Project, especially because in March, DHS made sweeping cuts to the divisions that oversee conditions in ICE facilities.

""Immigration detention has always been a dangerous place. It has been an abusive place across administrations,"" Cho says. ""What we are seeing is the clear degradation of accountability measures over conditions of confinement in detention facilities.""

The vast majority of people in ICE custody are in facilities run by for-profit companies, and Cho says that can create an incentive to cut corners.

""There is always a profit motive involved in trying to fill the facility with people. And the people who are profiting are the private prison companies,"" she says.

During the first nine months of this year, GEO Group reported a total revenue of nearly $2 billion – about 5% more than the same period last year.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5464x3074+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2Ff5%2Fd1e7f9324031b69e9ad7b014729c%2Fgettyimages-2223938108.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:18.462759

At a Dec. 17 Business Meeting, Binghamton's City Council unanimously passed resolution R25-73, officially banning all city agencies from collaborating with federal immigration efforts, including with ICE. The legislation was introduced by Councilmember Rebecca Rathmell at a Dec. 15 press conference.

In September, Binghamton Mayor Jared Kraham expressed his concern following potential ICE activity in the Binghamton area, stating any actions taken by ICE were done without the involvement or prior notification of the Binghamton Police Department.

According to Deputy Mayor Megan Heiman, Kraham’s stance on the issue has not changed since September.

“Mayor Kraham’s position on ICE operations under the Trump administration has not changed. Binghamton won’t waste its police resources on civil immigration matters, and rather will focus efforts on making our neighborhoods safer,” said Heiman. “The Binghamton Police Department already has a strong policy on the books to that effect.”

Binghamton City Council passes anti-ICE legislation

At a Dec. 15 City Council Work Session, City Council members voted to expedite voting on the legislation to Dec. 17, just two days after it was introduced.

On Dec. 17, City Council members voted 6-0, with Councilmember Michael Dundon absent, to pass the legislation. According to Councilmember Robert Cavanaugh, speed in approving the legislation was paramount not only to protect Binghamton residents but the city itself from potential liabilities or legal trouble.

According to Rathmell, the law has seen an outpouring of support from leaders both local and outside of Binghamton.

""This legislation was drafted in accordance with guidance issued by the New York State Attorney General's Office,"" said Rathmell. ""It's been reviewed, edited and signed off by the city's operational corporation council, and I think it is also valuable to point out that it was announced with the full support of the American Civic Association, the NAACP, the Binghamton Human Rights Commission, multiple county legislators, multiple faith leaders and at least three human rights organizations that are boots on the ground working with immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, folks that are directly affected by the risks.""

At the Dec. 17 meeting, several residents spoke or wrote statements in support of the legislation. The Dec. 15 press conference was attended by leaders of faith groups and civic associations including Hussein Adams, Executive Director and CEO of the American Civic Association.

""City resources should never be used to support unlawful raids and illegal police tactics that place irreparable damages and burdens on the city, destroys trust, jeopardizes public safety, affects refugee and immigrant population, affects new Americans who are frontline workers and affects every single resident of the city,"" said Adams.

Broome County agreement drew previous criticism

In March, the Broome County Jail signed an agreement with ICE as part of the 287g program. The program allows corrections officers to perform ""specified immigration officer functions,"" including executing administrative warrants within the jail.

At the Dec. 15 press conference, Rathmell referenced Sheriff Fred Akshar's decision to participate in the program, calling it a ""unilateral decision"" that has eroded trust in law enforcement.

One amendment to the legislation was made before it was voted on, with councilmembers unanimously voting to add the word ""emergency"" to section three of the legislation.

""City employees shall not expend time, money, or resources to assist or cooperate with any ICE investigation, operation, or enforcement action, except as required by law.

The National Council of Provinces (NCOP), in its final sitting of 2025 today, passed the Immigration Amendment Bill. This crucial piece of legislation aligns the country's immigration detention procedures with Constitutional Court rulings.

The Bill amends the Immigration Act of 2002 to address two specific Constitutional Court judgments. One amendment requires that any illegal foreign national detained for deportation purposes must be brought before a court in person within 48 hours of arrest. The court must then determine whether further detention is in the interests of justice before authorising deportation.

This amendment provides critical judicial oversight and provides clear guidance to immigration officers and the courts when exercising detention powers. With this Bill, a balance is struck between government's need to manage immigration effectively and the need to protect the rights of persons. This fosters a more just and transparent administrative system.

The passage of this Bill has significant implications for the administration of justice and the operations of the Department of Home Affairs. Among these are upholding constitutional rights as the Bill ensures that the fundamental right to freedom and security of the person is protected and mandates prompt judicial review of any immigration-related detention. The Bill also provides a clear, legally sound framework for immigration officials to reduce legal ambiguity and the potential for litigation. In this regard, the amendments are in the interest of justice. The Bill also improves oversight by requiring a court to authorise extensions to detention, thereby strengthening the rule of law and oversight within the immigration system.

The NCOP's Select Committee on Security and Justice processed the Bill, which included an extensive public participation process from 3 to 24 October 2025. By passing the Immigration Amendment Bill, Parliament has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring that laws comply with the highest standards of constitutional democracy.

His mother’s absence has left an immeasurable gap in their family, Harman Singh said.
His parents watched as people around them — friends, cousins, neighbors — were disappeared and later found dead, Harman Singh said.
“That was hard enough, just knowing that he’s gonna be battling cancer, but Mom was by his side,” Harman Singh said.","Babblejit “Bubbly” Kaur and her husband, Amarjit Singh, celebrated their 41st wedding anniversary in Long Beach in late November. The pair cradled a mint-frosted cake in their hands and beamed as their daughter, Joti, snapped pictures.

The couple endured a lot in those years, more than 30 of which have been spent in the U.S., after they fled religious persecution in India.

They arrived in 1994 with three young children and little money, facing a daunting asylum process. But the couple found their niche, operating a beloved Indian restaurant for decades, and saw their children through college.

This year had already been tough for the family. Singh was diagnosed with cancer and Kaur was laid off from her cashier job at Rite Aid, where she’d worked for decades, after the company closed in October. But the biggest hurdle for the family would come only days after the couple’s anniversary, on Dec. 1, when Kaur was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a routine fingerprinting appointment and eventually taken to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Joti Kaur, the couple’s youngest daughter, collapsed at work when she heard the news.

“I tell her, ‘Anytime you’re thinking of me, I was already thinking of you,” she said from the patio of her Long Beach apartment. “You’re literally the only thing I can think about, and getting you out of there.”

Kaur had an approved green card, but the government had not yet released it, said Harman Singh, her eldest son. The family’s lawyer filed a habeas corpus complaint early last week requesting the court review the legality of Kaur’s detention.

Kaur and her husband operated a restaurant, Natraj Cuisine of India, for decades and became familiar and beloved faces in the coastal city. When she wasn’t working at Rite Aid, she’d be greeting customers at Natraj, alongside her husband, who also took charge in the kitchen as needed. Community members came out in droves to support the family, setting up a GoFundMe that has garnered over $26,000 and a Change.org petition with over 1,600 signatures.

Within days of her arrest, a popular Long Beach food group on Facebook had posted the news and caught the attention of Congressman Robert Garcia, who represents the state’s 42nd Congressional District, including Long Beach.

Garcia has filed a petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that processes immigration applications, requesting the expedited release of Kaur’s green card given the urgency of her husband’s care. His office has also sent requests to ICE and the Adelanto ICE Processing Center for her release.

The congressman said Kaur’s detainment is one of many cases across the country where “we’re encouraging people to do things the right way and to show up to appointments, and then we’re detaining them at appointments that we invited them to.”

“The Long Beach community is outraged about this,” he said. “It’s absolutely crazy and inhumane. It’s no way to treat people.”

Kaur’s arrest was carried out by FBI agents, Laura Eimiller, the agency’s media coordinator confirmed to The Times, as “part of our ongoing assistance to ICE relative to immigration enforcement.”

One of the main tactics of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in recent months has been detaining people at appointments during their asylum or visa proceedings and, in some cases, deporting them.

His mother’s absence has left an immeasurable gap in their family, Harman Singh said. They’ve had to pick up where she left off, handling bills and navigating their father’s cancer treatment. In a way, he said, it felt like mourning a loved one’s death, only “they’re physically still here in the world, you just can’t reach out to them.”

“This vacuum, this gap, it’s all over America,” Harman Singh said. “This is not just our story.”

Kaur and Singh had been joined at the hip since they wed in 1984, the same year violence against Sikhs, their religious community, erupted in India. India’s Punjab state was a Sikh kingdom before the British took over, and the community had long been fighting for a separate Sikh state in the region.

In 1984, tensions came to a head when a siege, ordered by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on the holiest site in Sikhism, turned deadly. In retaliation, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated her. Hindu mobs then went on a rampage, killing thousands of Sikhs, in what the California Legislature has labeled a genocide.

Large swaths of the Sikh community began to flee India. His parents watched as people around them — friends, cousins, neighbors — were disappeared and later found dead, Harman Singh said.

They left for the U.S. a decade later. Now, their son said, they’re facing persecution similar to that from which their parents fled all those years ago.

“This was supposed to be the place where you have freedom to live without fear … but it’s sort of turning into that nightmare again,” Harman Singh said. “We’re just repeating what our parents ran away from.”

Today, the Sikh diaspora, who have mostly settled in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, are still targeted. Canadian-Indian relations were strained after the murder of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil in 2023. The Canadian government alleges India’s government was behind the slaying, claims New Delhi has denied.

In August 2024, a truck transporting a Sikh political leader came under fire in Sacramento. In 2023, U.S. officials announced they had foiled an assassination attempt connected to the Indian government against a Sikh activist.

Natraj Cuisine of India on 2nd Street in Belmont Shore, Long Beach, was like a fourth child to Kaur and Singh.

Singh first worked as a waiter at the old Laguna Beach location before transferring to Long Beach. Eventually, they became the face of the restaurant, often working more than 12-hour days. The couple managed the restaurant’s daily operations until their departure in 2020.

“The best way to describe my mom, she will feed everybody in this room and the neighbors before she feeds herself,” Joti Kaur said. “That was their love language, feeding us, the community, and anyone they could.”

Kaur worked at Natraj whenever she wasn’t picking up a shift at Rite Aid and would head to the restaurant during her lunch breaks.

The couple left the restaurant just weeks before COVID-19 hit in 2020. They recently became involved in another restaurant, Royal Indian Curry House, which is still in development.

“They were looking forward to help doing that and getting back into serving meals, because that’s what they love to do,” Joti Kaur said.

Singh depends on his wife for nearly everything, their children said. She took the lead in getting the family settled in the U.S., learning English, getting a driver’s license and even figuring out how to hook up Harman Singh’s PlayStation.

When Singh was diagnosed with cancer, his wife once again took charge. The family looked to her whenever a crucial decision needed to be made.

The day of her appointment, she felt something was wrong.

“She called me that morning and she was anxious,” Joti Kaur said. “I wish I would’ve stayed on the phone with her a little bit longer. She already knew something wasn’t right.”

Harman Singh, who now lives in Sacramento, was also on edge, having seen the countless cases of immigrants detained at government-set appointments.

Fingerprinting appointments had become common practice for the family, who have been tangled in a web of asylum proceedings since they landed at a New York airport in 1994. The two oldest children, including Harman Singh, have since become naturalized citizens. Joti Kaur and her dad have green cards. The only one left waiting was Kaur.

The government already had Kaur’s fingerprints on file, which is why the family was puzzled when they received notice of this appointment.

“You have a hearing coming up and it’s like, if they don’t go, they’re in trouble. If they go, they’re in trouble,” Harman Singh said. “They set it up in such a way that they’re going to get the result they want.”

Now, for the first time in decades, Kaur and Singh have been forced to sleep in separate beds,their children said, and neither gets much sleep at all.

“That was hard enough, just knowing that he’s gonna be battling cancer, but Mom was by his side,” Harman Singh said. “Now there’s just a sense of loneliness that they both have. We are helpless, and we can’t do anything to fix that.”

The lights in the Adelanto ICE Processing Center never turn off, which is enough to keep most awake. It’s the noises, often cries from newly arrived detainees, however, that keep Kaur up, often well past 2 in the morning.

She’s lucky if she gets a couple of hours of sleep a night, her children said.

The guilt creeps into both children at all hours of the day. Joti Kaur often feels it late at night, when she’s curled up under the covers of her bed and is suddenly reminded of how cold her mom must be. Her brother feels it every time he puts on a jacket or turns on the hot water in the shower.

Every family dinner Joti Kaur missed or phone calls she cut short when her mother was still home add to the guilt.

“I wish I could take it back and go to those dinners and have spent that time, because now, I don’t know when the next dinner is going to be with her,” she said.

A light amid the worry, however, is the community that her mother has built at the detention center. She’s met women of all ages and from all walks of life, one as old as 85.

When Harman Singh arrived at Adelanto to visit his mom for the first time in early December, he heard the women inside erupt in cheers. The noise felt jarring in such a cold facility.

But it’s what the women do for one another every time one of them gets bonded out, his mother told him.

“There’s just a sense of camaraderie. They’re like, ‘We’re in this together,’ which I’m very grateful for,” Harman Singh said. “She has girls to talk to. She goes, ‘If they weren’t there, I would just be in depression right now.’”

His mother has connected with two Indian women. The trio often pray together, and ration whatever milk they get that day to make tea. One is younger, and has started calling Kaur mama.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99c7a4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+621/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F9d%2F69f2956d40d2a243a9b016083f41%2Fme-babbeljit-kaur-detained-ice09.JPEG,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:21.424915

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. military yesterday killed four people in a strike on a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific, U.S. Southern Command said on social media. The attack brought the total number of known boat strikes to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration. AP News reports.

“We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” President Trump told reporters yesterday when asked about his blockade against oil tankers travelling to or from Venezuela. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it — they illegally took it.” David Klepper and Aamer Madhani report for AP News.

Several ships sailed from Venezuela towards Asia with a Venezuelan naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, three sources said. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has ordered his navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, risking a confrontation with the United States at sea. A U.S. official said Washington was aware of the naval escorts and was considering various courses of action. Edward Wong, Anatoly Kurmanaev, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday voted 216-210 against a resolution that would remove U.S. armed forces from hostilities with “any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere” unless authorized by Congress. It also voted 213 to 211 against a resolution directing the president to ask Congress for authorization to use military force before engaging in hostilities within or against Venezuela. Both votes were almost exclusively along party lines. Patricia Zengerle reports for Reuters; Robert Jimison reports for the New York Times.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) said yesterday that the House Armed Services Committee has finished examining a U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, where two survivors were killed in a follow-up attack, after viewing the full video of the strike in a classified briefing led by Adm. Frank M. Bradley. Rogers said that the Pentagon had fully met his expectations for congressional oversight and that he was satisfied that the lawful process was followed. Robert Jimison reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

EU member states are set to decide today on 2026-2027 funding for Ukraine, with discussions centered on plans to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan. Hungary and Slovakia have voiced opposition to using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy and Malta have expressed reservations and remain undecided. “We just can’t afford to fail. We have to show that we are strong,” EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said, adding that leaders would stay as long as needed at the Brussels summit to find a solution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now planning to participate in the summit in person, having previously said he would attend by video call. Lorne Cook, Sam McNeil, and Angela Charlton report for AP News; Jan Strupczewski and Andrew Gray report for Reuters.

Belgium today reiterated that its EU partners must provide ironclad guarantees that it will be protected from Russian retaliation before it would support the use of frozen Russian assets to back a loan for Ukraine. “I have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium’s concerns,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said, “I hope to see one today.” Lorne Cook, Sam McNeil, and Angela Charlton report for AP News.

Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev is expected to visit Miami this weekend for talks with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on the current U.S. plan to end the war in Ukraine, a White House official and another source said. A Ukrainian delegation is also expected to arrive in Miami later this week for talks with Witkoff and Kushner. There is no plan for a trilateral meeting, the sources said. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli troops fired a mortar shell over the ceasefire line into a residential area in Gaza, wounding at least 10 people, health officials at Al-Ahli hospital said yesterday. The Israeli military said the mortar was fired during an operation on the Israeli-controlled side of the Yellow Line. The military did not say what the troops were doing or whether they had crossed the line, but said that the mortar had veered from its target. Julia Frankel reports for AP News.

The U.N. and more than 200 other aid groups yesterday warned in a joint statement that humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza, are at risk of collapse if Israel does not lift restrictions that include a “vague, arbitrary, and highly politicized” registration process. Dozens of aid groups face de-registration by Dec. 31, which would mean they have to close operations entirely within 60 days, the statement said. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters; UN News reports.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary killed over 1,000 civilians in April during the takeover of the Zamzam camp, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office published today. The findings are based on interviews conducted in July 2025 with 155 survivors and witnesses who fled to Chad. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

More than 1,600 people have been killed in attacks on medical and health care centers in Sudan so far this year, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said yesterday. Ghebreyesus said the agency has documented 65 attacks on health facilities since January. Samy Magdy report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH – CEASEFIRE

French, Saudi Arabian, and U.S. officials will hold talks with the head of the Lebanese Army in Paris today aimed at finalising a roadmap to enable the disarmament of Hezbollah, diplomats said. The talks plan to create more robust conditions to support the disarmament process and dissuade Israel from escalation, four diplomats told Reuters. The idea would be to reinforce the existing ceasefire mechanism with French, U.S. and possibly other military experts along with U.N. peacekeeping forces, the diplomats and officials said. John Irish and Jana Choukeir report.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels yesterday claimed to have begun withdrawal from the city of Uvira in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Betrand Bisimwa, leader of the M23, told AP News, adding that the withdrawal would be complete by this morning. When asked who would take control of the city following his forces withdrawal, Bisimwa said the responsibility fell to the mediators and that M23 had “requested a neutral force, and we believe that those who asked us to withdraw will be able to deploy them very quickly.”A spokesperson for the governor of South Kivu said he was unable to confirm the withdrawal late Wednesday night. Ruth Alonga and Wilson McMakin report for AP News

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday announced that he had approved an unprecedented $35 billion deal to sell natural gas to Egypt. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Brazil’s Senate yesterday voted 48-25 to approve a bill to shorten former President Jair Bolsonaro’s sentence from 27 years to just over two years. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto it. Maria Carolina Marcello reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States yesterday approved $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan. The proposed arms sales cover eight items, including HIMARS rocket systems, howitzers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Altius loitering munition drones and parts for other equipment, Taiwan’s defence ministry said in a statement. Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina report for Reuters.

The U.S. State Department yesterday demanded that Honduras’ National Electoral Council (CNE) immediately begin counting a manual count of ballots from last month’s presidential election. The NEC has blamed protests for preventing it from starting the manual count of hundreds of thousands of ballots that it said showed inconsistencies and were therefore excluded from the initial tally. “Any call to disrupt public order or the [CNE’s] work will be met with consequences,” the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media. Laura Garcia reports for Reuters.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration has asked U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices to “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month,” according to internal guidance issued on Tuesday and obtained by the New York Times. By comparison, between 2017 and this year, there have been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department. Hamed Aleaziz reports.

Guan Heng, a Chinese man who secretly filmed Uyghur detention camps in Western China and later applied for asylum in the United States in 2021, was detained by ICE in August. On Monday, the Trump administration moved to continue deportation proceedings, arguing that Guan should be sent to Uganda under third-country asylum rules. Emily Feng reports for NPR; Amy Qin and Chris Buckley report for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Senate yesterday voted 77-20 in support of the $901 billion National Defense Authorization Act. Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO.

Former special counsel Jack Smith yesterday told lawmakers in a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee that his team of investigators “developed proof beyond reasonable doubt” that Trump had criminally conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to documents obtained by AP News. Smith also said investigators had accrued “powerful evidence” that Trump broke the law by hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Eric Tucker and Lisa Mascaro report.

Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) this week put holds on the nomination of Adm. Kevin Lunday to lead the U.S. Coast Guard, citing concerns with a new workplace harassment policy that downgrades the definition of swastikas and nooses from hate symbols to “potentially divisive.” In a statement, Duckworth questioned why Lunday would not update the policy manual “to delete the absurd characterization that clearly states a noose and swastika are merely potentially divisive symbols,” adding that the admiral had previously affirmed that both “are symbols of hate.” Rosen said the hold will remain in place “until the Coast Guard provides answers.” Tara Copp, Marianne LeVine, and Michelle Boorstein report for the Washington Post.

The Navy disciplined 18 Navy SEALS earlier this year after military investigators found a group chat that contained racist memes targeting a Black SEAL who was also in the chat, according to documents and a Naval Special Warfare spokesperson. The punishments ranged from reduction in rank and forfeiture of pay to administrative measures, according to the Navy spokesperson. CBS News learned that Rear Adm. Milton Sands, then the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, acted swiftly once the allegations surfaced in March. Sands has since been removed from his position by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The reason for his removal is unknown. Eleanor Watson and James LaPorta report.

Ghislaine Maxwell yesterday asked a federal judge to set aside her December 2021 conviction, alleging that a series of constitutional violations had denied her a fair trial. Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said yesterday that he plans to step down from the bureau in January. After Bongino’s announcement, FBI Director Kash Patel called him “the best partner I could’ve asked for in helping restore this FBI.” Ryan Lucas reports for NPR; Dareh Gregorian reports for NBC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that National Guard troops stationed in Washington, D.C., since August could remain while the court considered the legality of the deployment. The three-judge panel wrote, “Because the District of Columbia is a federal district created by Congress, rather than a constitutionally sovereign entity like the 50 states, the defendants appear on this early record likely to prevail on the merits of their argument.” Zack Montague reports for the New York Times

A federal judge yesterday ruled that ICE cannot enforce newly adopted policies that require lawmakers to provide seven days notice before visiting detention facilities and entirely barring congressional visits to field offices being used to detain immigrants. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

The migration crisis is not, at its core, a border crisis — it is a crisis of global conscience, one that remains unresolved because the world has yet to confront its root causes.","World Migration Day is an annual opportunity to reflect on one of the most complex and persistent crises of the contemporary world — a crisis that has not been contained by walls, laws, or deterrence. Instead, migration has reached unprecedented levels, accompanied by rising human cost and suffering. Contrary to dominant political narratives, migration is rarely a simple choice; it is often a last means of survival for millions whose homes have been stripped away by war, poverty, repression, and the collapse of political systems. Yet today, more than ever, migrants are treated not as human beings but as a “security problem.”

From Afghanistan to Palestine, from Somalia to Sudan, the roots of migration lie in crises largely shaped by prolonged wars, foreign interventions, political instability, and economic collapse. Afghanistan, following the Taliban’s return to power, stands as a stark example of a country whose citizens have been forced into an impossible choice: remain under constant threat or flee toward an uncertain future. Women, journalists, civil society activists, and minorities have borne the greatest burden. For them, migration is not a pursuit of opportunity but an escape from systematic erasure.

The degrading treatment and forced deportation of Afghan migrants from Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and other countries reflect a practical collapse of human rights commitments and the dominance of a security-driven approach to a profoundly humanitarian issue. Under this lens, Afghan migrants are no longer seen as victims of war, repression, and political breakdown, but as a vague, uniform threat — a narrative that deliberately ignores distinctions between women, children, workers, asylum seekers, and the sick. This “one-size-fits-all” policy has paved the way for humiliation, mass arrests, and rushed deportations, effectively hollowing out the fundamental principle of non-refoulement. These actions are less about enforcing the law and more about rising nationalism and governments attempting to manage domestic crises by sacrificing the most vulnerable.

At the same time, these deportations highlight the international community’s failure to assume responsibility for the Afghan crisis. Iran and Pakistan, under economic and political pressure, are bearing the cost of a crisis whose roots extend far beyond their borders. Yet the chosen response has been to shift suffering onto the weakest link. Forcibly returning Afghans to a country where security, basic freedoms, and a foreseeable future are absent amounts to knowingly placing human lives at risk. Such policies neither halt migration nor create stability; they normalize injustice and deepen the crisis.

In Palestine, migration takes a different but equally painful form. Blockade, repeated wars, and the destruction of infrastructure have condemned generations to permanent displacement — people deprived not only of the right to migrate safely but even of the right to remain with dignity. Gaza today is not merely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a symbol of the global system’s failure to protect civilians, where migration itself is often not even a viable option.

In Somalia, decades of civil war, terrorism, and drought have made migration part of daily life. Those forced from their land fall prey to deadly human smuggling routes, becoming victims of networks that feed on despair. This pattern repeats across parts of Africa and the Middle East: the geography changes, but the suffering remains the same.

On the other side of this equation lie the migration policies of the United States and Europe — policies that have grown increasingly restrictive over the past two decades. By intensifying border controls, accelerating deportations, and narrowing legal pathways, the United States has made migration more dangerous, not less. Borders may be tighter, but migration has not stopped; only the number of victims has increased.

In Europe, border deals, walls, maritime patrols, and outsourcing responsibility to third countries have reshaped a continent once seen as a champion of human rights into one primarily focused on “crisis management.” The Mediterranean has become one of the deadliest migration routes in the world, claiming the lives of thousands of women, men, and children each year — lives largely absent from policy calculations.

What is most striking is the deep contradiction between human rights rhetoric and operational reality. Western governments speak of human dignity while blocking migrants at their borders. International refugee conventions remain formally valid, but political will to enforce them has eroded dramatically. Migration, rather than being understood as a consequence of global crises, has been reduced to a domestic threat.

The reality is clear: migration cannot be stopped by walls or suppressed by laws. As long as war continues in Afghanistan, occupation and blockade persist in Palestine, collapse endures in Somalia, and injustice spreads across the Global South, people will keep moving. Hardline policies may alter official statistics, but they do not change the human reality.

World Migration Day should remind us of a fundamental truth: migrants are neither numbers, burdens, nor threats. They are human beings carrying the weight of political failure, war, and injustice on their bodies. The migration crisis is not, at its core, a border crisis — it is a crisis of global conscience, one that remains unresolved because the world has yet to confront its root causes.

Among those rallying support for the bill has been Heather R. Yountz, senior immigration staff attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
As much as the bill would help immigrants authorized to work in the United States, it would also help employers, Yountz adds.
“There needs to be the ability to help our workers here in Massachusetts.” As countermeasures go, Lewis’ bill may be modest, Yountz acknowledges.
“Nothing is going to be a silver bullet in this time, but each step that we can take will make a difference in the lives of millions of immigrants,” Yountz says.","The proposal would add only one operative sentence to the state law governing the employment of “aliens,” G.L.c. 149, §19C.

But the 45 words in a bill on the move on Beacon Hill could make a world of difference for lawfully permanent residents authorized to work in the United States, says a longtime immigration litigator.

Under federal law, the Department of Homeland Security must provide employers with three days’ notice before arriving to inspect employees’ I-9 employment eligibility verification forms and supporting documentation.

Sen. Jason M. Lewis’ bill, S. 2665, would ensure that employees get the same three-day warning by requiring their employers to post a notice about an imminent inspection of I-9 records in a visible area. The bill was recently reported favorably out of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development.

Among those rallying support for the bill has been Heather R. Yountz, senior immigration staff attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. Yountz has been litigating immigration matters for 17 years.

During the first Trump administration, Yountz and her former law partner, Susan B. Church, challenged the Muslim travel ban in federal court in Boston. They also brought a case seeking monetary damages for those who had been directly affected by the administration’s family separation policy.

Yountz joined MLRI in 2021, and while Joe Biden was in the White House, one of her focuses was advising Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey.

“But then, when Trump took office, it became clear that the Senate and the House and essentially the Supreme Court are all Republican-leaning, it didn’t make sense for me to be in the federal space anymore,” she says.

So, Yountz shifted her focus.

“The thought would be that I could use my way of trying to predict what Trump will do next in the litigation world and find state legislation that would protect as many immigrants as possible in Massachusetts — to try to get out ahead of it, basically,” Yountz says.

The weaponization of what had previously been a less consequential process quickly came to the fore, according to Yountz.

When employees start a new job, they fill out an I-9 form and provide certain forms of identification, such as a passport, Social Security card, driver’s license or, in the case of immigrants, a work authorization card.

Since the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986, the federal government has had the right to inspect I-9 forms.

“They don’t need a warrant to access it,” Yountz says. “All they need is to give three days’ notice to the employer.”

When previous administrations discovered technical or substantive violations, employers would typically get opportunities to cure those defects. But the Trump administration is taking a different approach.

“They’re collecting the data so that they can make an arrest of an immigrant in their home, in the workplace, on the streets, as we’ve all seen,” she says.

Because they are almost entirely within the authority of the federal government, raids are inevitable, according to Yountz.

“We can’t do anything about raids,” she says. “We can, however, do something about the information that the Trump administration is accessing before they can raid, or before they can make arrests.”

Lewis’ bill would simply ensure employees get the same notice their employers receive. Similar laws are already in place in California, Illinois and Oregon and have withstood legal challenges, Yountz says.

“The Trump administration sued California in 2018, lost, and they appealed it to the [9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals], lost again,” she says. “They recently sued the state of Illinois in 2025 and also lost.”

The administration’s main argument is that IRCA preempts states’ attempts to legislate in this area. But so far, that argument has not carried the day.

“I don’t want to say [the proposed Massachusetts law is] preemption proof, but that’s the thing that you worry about the most when you’re legislating in the state space on a federal issue like this,” Yountz says.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at the Allston Car Wash in early November that led to nine employees being detained illustrates how important the three days’ lead time can be, Yountz notes.

One detail that has emerged from the Allston raid is that some workers with documentation were allegedly not allowed to go to their lockers to retrieve it for ICE officers. With notice of an inspection, immigrants could ensure that they are carrying their documentation on their person, Yountz says.

Employees can also use those three days to talk to an attorney about what they need to demonstrate their status in the United States. The second Trump administration has slowed or even stopped the production of work authorization cards, Yountz says. That means that many immigrants, though still eligible to work, have expired cards.

“They sometimes have to print something off of the internet, out of the Federal Register, or demonstrate [their status] with a receipt or some other way,” Yountz says.

Immigrants can also use the time to develop answers to tough questions like, “Who’s going to take care of my kids if I get wrongfully arrested and thrown in a detention facility? Who’s going to access my bank accounts? Who’s going to hire an attorney for me to fight this unlawful detention?” she adds.

Even lawful immigrants are being forced to confront such questions, Yountz says.

“It’s this combination of the Trump administration accessing all of this data and using it for enforcement purposes, and at the same time, ICE officers acting with a high level of impunity and disregarding the lawful status of immigrants, or perhaps not understanding that an immigrant is indeed ‘in status,’ but the documentation might, on its face, not look that way,” she says.

As much as the bill would help immigrants authorized to work in the United States, it would also help employers, Yountz adds.

“The concern about losing your employees at a time where hiring is so difficult and restricted is terrifying,” she says. “A large percentage of businesses that are being targeted for these inspections are small businesses, and there’s a real concern about having to close their doors if they are not able to have even one cook in the kitchen, or one landscaper working that day.”

If S. 2665 becomes law, the state would provide a template for the notice employers would be required to post, making it straightforward for owners of small businesses who might not have the benefit of the services of an immigration attorney to understand what the law requires of them.

The transparency the notices would provide can also help smooth employer-employee relations at a fraught time, Yountz says.

“Employees don’t understand why their boss would give their private information over to the federal government this way,” she says. “But if the employer [says], ‘Look, we have to do this, the federal government is forcing us by law,’ that makes more sense to them.”

Yountz has been pleasantly surprised that the proposal — a late-filed, standalone bill in August — has gotten traction so quickly on Beacon Hill. It has no known opposition, and it has gained the endorsement of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association and the Massachusetts Bar Association’s House of Delegates, among other organizations.

“I’m so grateful to the Legislature for taking this seriously and recognizing that this is not your average, everyday bill,” she says. “This is something that we need now.”

For example, on Feb. 3, approximately 15,000 Haitian residents of Massachusetts are going to lose their temporary protected status, Yountz notes.

“We really need to be prepared for whatever enforcement action may result from that,” she says. “There needs to be the ability to help our workers here in Massachusetts.”

As countermeasures go, Lewis’ bill may be modest, Yountz acknowledges.

“It reinforces the rule of law and reminds the administration that oversight is not optional.
The complaint noted “widespread” mistreatment at detention facilities across the U.S, which had at least 11 deaths in the first six months of the Trump administration.
“Blocking members of Congress from oversight visits to ICE facilities that house or otherwise detain immigrants clearly violates federal law — and the Trump administration knows it,” Neguse has said.
“This decision makes clear that no president can hide the truth about how people are treated in federal immigration custody.","A federal court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration policy that has impeded lawmakers from conducting unannounced visits to federal immigration detention facilities.

“Today’s decision is a critical victory toward restoring our ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people,” lawmakers said in a joint statement. “It reinforces the rule of law and reminds the administration that oversight is not optional. Real-time, on-the-ground visits to immigration detention facilities help prevent abuses and ensure transparency. Oversight is a core responsibility of members of Congress —and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. We’ll continue standing up for the rule of law.”

In July, a dozen Democratic lawmakers, led by U.S. Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow of Colorado, filed a lawsuit challenging what they allege is the Trump administration’s “unlawful obstruction” of their oversight in blocking lawmakers’ access to federal immigration detention centers.

The suit asserts members of Congress have authority to conduct investigations related to their legislative role. The complaint noted “widespread” mistreatment at detention facilities across the U.S, which had at least 11 deaths in the first six months of the Trump administration.

“Blocking members of Congress from oversight visits to ICE facilities that house or otherwise detain immigrants clearly violates federal law — and the Trump administration knows it,” Neguse has said. “Such blatant disregard for both the law and the constitutional order by the Trump administration warrants a serious and decisive response.”

The complaint contended Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were requiring seven days advance notice to schedule a visit.

The visits were in response to the “kids in cages” controversy the year before when images surfaced showing immigrant children — who were forcibly separated from their parents — being held in chain-link pens.

The Trump-era “zero tolerance” policy of mass family separation led to widespread condemnation and calls for immigration reform.

The lawsuit notes that Congress has approved provisions since 2019 that prevent appropriated funds to the Department of Homeland Security being used to prevent members from entering facilities for the purpose of conducting oversight.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.

Previously, DHS officials have defended their actions, saying the agency has seen a dramatic increase in the number of “assaults, disruptions and obstructions” to enforcement, necessitating the need for scheduled tours.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the lawsuit a Democratic fundraising tactic.

“These members of Congress could have just scheduled a tour; instead, they’re running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails,” McLaughlin has said.

Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight are representing the lawmakers in the lawsuit.

“This ruling is a victory for the American people and their elected representatives ,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.

“This decision makes clear that no president can hide the truth about how people are treated in federal immigration custody. We’re honored to represent these individual members of Congress in defending accountability, transparency, the rule of law, and human dignity.”

President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to D.C. streets in August.
In addition to asking for the deployment to be stopped entirely, Schwalb asked a judge to halt the deployment as litigation continued.
That order set off another flurry of litigation; the Trump administration asked an appeals court to block the order from going into effect.
Gabe Shoglow-Rubenstein, a spokesperson for Schwalb, said the appeals court ruling was preliminary and does not address D.C.’s core arguments in the case.","An appeals court signaled Wednesday that it may find the National Guard deployment in D.C. to be lawful, disagreeing with a lower-court judge’s opinion and issuing an order that will allow troops to stay in the city while litigation continues.

A three-judge panel – with two Trump appointees and one Obama appointee – wrote that the Trump administration is likely to succeed in its appeal of that lower-court ruling. The panel’s unanimous order on Wednesday was not a determination of the deployment’s legality and functioned only to allow the troops to remain pending final rulings, likely to come next year.

“Because the District of Columbia is a federal district created by Congress, rather than a constitutionally sovereign entity like the fifty States, the Defendants appear on this early record likely to prevail on the merits of their argument that the President possesses a unique power within the District – the seat of the federal government – to mobilize the Guard,” wrote the panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to D.C. streets in August. Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the District, ramping up federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement, temporarily seizing control of the police department, and ordering a deployment of troops that has since swelled to about 2,600 National Guard members from D.C. and 10 states with Republican governors.

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, a Democrat, sued the Trump administration over the deployment in September, arguing that it was an illegal incursion on the city’s autonomy and alleging that the troops were improperly engaged in law enforcement. In addition to asking for the deployment to be stopped entirely, Schwalb asked a judge to halt the deployment as litigation continued.

A U.S. District Court judge has not issued an opinion on the underlying lawsuit but in November gave D.C. a preliminary legal win, ordering the Trump administration to halt the deployment by Dec. 11 as the case continued. That order set off another flurry of litigation; the Trump administration asked an appeals court to block the order from going into effect.

On Dec. 4, the appeals court said the Guard could stay in the city as the judges continued to weigh the Trump administration’s requests – and on Wednesday, they granted the administration’s motion for stay pending appeal, meaning the Guard can remain in the District for now.

The appeals court judges said their order was preliminary and their assessment was “hurried.” They also noted that they did not address some of Schwalb’s central arguments - whether the Guard units were engaged in law enforcement in violation of federal law and whether the Guard troops from other states were improperly under federal command.

However, the judges wrote, the stay pending appeal is an “extraordinary remedy” that required the Trump administration to show that it was likely to prevail in its appeal of the lower-court ruling.

“The Defendants have demonstrated on this preliminary record that they will likely succeed in showing that the guard deployments are lawful” under federal and local law, they said.

Gabe Shoglow-Rubenstein, a spokesperson for Schwalb, said the appeals court ruling was preliminary and does not address D.C.’s core arguments in the case.

“This is a preliminary ruling that doesn’t resolve the merits, and we look forward to continuing our case in both the district and appellate courts,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-12-18 11:58:24.717942

Thursday 18 December 2025 marks International Migrants Day. The annual celebration shines a spotlight on the contributions of migrants to societies and draws attention to the increasingly complex environment in which migration occurs.

The United Nations Migration Agency defines a migrant as any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a State away from their habitual place of residence, irrespective of an individuals’ legal status, whether movement is voluntary or involuntary, the reasons for movement or what the length of the stay is.

One of the key messages of this years’ International Migrants Day is to call States to action to ensure that migration is managed safely and strategically by supporting regular pathways for migration. In doing so, the rights of migrants are upheld and protected and are able to better contribute to the prosperity, resilience and the economies of host countries.

To do this, States must ensure that migrants, irrespective of status or income, are able to access free or affordable justice.

Access to Justice

Access to justice is a fundamental human right. It means that individuals can access and utilise existing judicial mechanisms to protect their rights and obtain redress in response to violations.

Access to justice is a core principle which underpins many of the UN migration frameworks for safer migration:

The access to justice should not be hindered by anything, and certainly not by the irregular status in which some migrants find themselves. The total and complete access to the existing legal and judicial mechanisms should be ensured, to guarantee that right. Access to justice is therefore a crucial tool to address impunity and ensure the rule of law.

(International Migration Law Unit)

The significance of access to justice as a fundamental right is indisputable, but Wales, and the rest of the UK, have a long way to go in ensuring fair and equitable access to justice.

Immigration legal services: a crisis

Wales has become an immigration legal advice desert, where the demand for services far outweighs supply. Legal aid, a means of ensuring that everyone regardless of income can access the law for remedies, is in crisis. There are now only four legal aid providers taking on immigration and asylum cases, and this provision in the year 2024-5 was only enough to serve 16% of cases which fall within the scope of legal aid.

Organisations providing immigration legal advice services in Wales under the Immigration Advice Authority (IAA) are also in severe shortage, with only two organisations operating at Level 3 IAA (the highest regulated service). More detail can be found in the Bevan Foundation’s most recent report, which maps the existing provision and need for immigration legal services in Wales,

Previous research by the Bevan Foundation found that 40% of participants currently seeking legal help had not found any assistance, and half of these were seeking asylum. Nearly 50% of all participants had difficulty in finding legal advice and representation.

The declining immigration legal advice sector in Wales has harmful impacts on people. Over 40% of the people we spoke to had experienced negative financial or emotional impacts as a result of being able to find good quality, free and affordable immigration legal advice or representation.

Justice without borders

Accessible, affordable justice ensures that migrants can utilise existing migration pathways. It means they can regularise status, access a sense of security, lift children and families out of poverty, form part of cohesive communities and better contribute to the local economy.

While there are initiatives in place to help improve access to justice for migrants in Wales, much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone’s right to access justice is secured.

The Bevan Foundation is developing a strategy as part of its Developing the Immigration Advice Sector project. Find out more about the project here.

She went inside, while her husband remained outside, but an unexpected message informed him that he, too, had to enter the building. At that moment, the officers told them that one of them was going to be deported, but that the couple had to choose who it would be. She said she would leave because he was the one who worked and supported the household. He said no, she should stay with their two children. In the end, it was the mother who remained in the United States.

“I was shocked,” says Mendez-Zamora, who accompanied the family. “It has been one of the most difficult years, the cruelest, where we have seen the most human rights violations,” the activist asserts outside the Miramar facility, where a group of volunteers, organizations, religious leaders, and relatives of people detained by ICE gathered to protest on the eve of International Migrants Day, commemorated on December 18.

The closing year, 2025, is likely to be remembered as the most terrifying on record for the immigrant population in the United States, with more than 65,000 people in detention, 605,000 deportations, and 1.9 million self-deportations, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “The Trump administration is breaking historic records,” said DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin last week. “Illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now. They know that if they don’t, we will find them, we will arrest them, and they will never return,” she added.

Like a horror film, images of the immigration offensive launched by the White House have unfolded over the past few months: families being forcibly separated by masked agents; children afraid to go to school and parents in hiding; deportations to third countries, some as far away as South Sudan or Eswatini; mass raids in different cities across the country; arrests inside courthouses; hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their legal status...

“It’s been an exhausting, frustrating year. What’s been happening has been terrifying,” says María Asunción Bilbao, campaign coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee in Florida, who goes to the ICE offices in Miramar every week to accompany migrant families to their appointments with the authorities. “Tomorrow, International Migrants Day, will be a sad day in this country because they aren’t respecting the rights of any refugee, but I admire the bravery of the migrants; it takes courage to leave everything behind and come to a new country.”

What is happening today in the United States is a reality that will not surprise those who listened attentively to Trump throughout his campaign, built on the rhetoric of guaranteeing “national security” through the expulsion of all “criminals.” Trump has gone all out to fulfill what he promised before the elections that returned him to power in November 2024: to carry out “the largest deportation in history.”

ICE arrests on the rise

In an effort to professionalize the expulsion of migrants, Trump deployed not only his rhetoric but also a vast economic arsenal to ensure the detention, imprisonment, and deportation of people. For this purpose, he had an agency he would strengthen until it became the greatest source of fear: ICE.

Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s anti-immigrant policy, observed that arrests were progressing slowly during the first few months of the campaign, making it necessary to increase the number of arrests to 3,000 per day if the promised quota was to be met. While federal authorities had arrested around 18,000 people per month by April, by November the number of arrests stood at 21,127, a figure that was still below the government’s targets.

To strengthen, among other things, the ICE machinery, Trump signed his tax reform bill, the so-called “big, beautiful bill,” into law in July. The agency thus became the best-funded in U.S. history, with a budget of over $100 billion, up from approximately $8 billion. Some $45 billion would be allocated to the construction of new detention centers and about $14 billion to deportation operations. An additional $30 billion would be used to recruit more agents, bringing the total number of personnel dedicated to pursuing migrants to 100,000.

The result has been visible: large-scale immigration raids in major, primarily Democratic, cities, which in the past had served as sanctuaries. Agents have arrived in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Charlotte, North Carolina, despite objections from local authorities. They are also present at courthouses across the country, waiting for migrants to finish their hearings so they can handcuff them.

Increase in deportation flights

Other tools have also served to grease the wheels of the government’s anti-immigrant machinery in recent months: the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for multiple nationalities and hundreds of thousands of people; the elimination of the parole program, which left more than half a million beneficiaries in limbo; the travel ban signed in June to halt legal migration from several countries, expanded to 39 nations this week; thousands of 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to work hand-in-hand with ICE; and the signing of pacts with third countries that receive deported migrants. According to Human Rights First’s ICE flight monitor, deportation flights during the second Trump administration have exceeded 1,900, a 41% increase compared to the same period in 2014.

The president has also not hesitated to push the boundaries of the law to achieve his goals, defying courts that attempt to block his actions. Invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, the Republican administration sent more than 200 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador, despite a judge’s injunction. Other migrants have been sent to offshore detention centers, such as the Guantanamo Naval Base. The number of people released on bail, parole, or supervised release has also decreased, falling to 3% in September.

In addition to all this, the president suspended not only asylum and residency processes, but also halted procedures such as citizenship applications, thus undermining the highest status a migrant can achieve in the country. Recently, Trump was asked if he planned to denaturalize migrants who had obtained citizenship. “If I have the power to do it — I’m not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize, absolutely,” he replied. This Tuesday, it was revealed that his administration will seek to denaturalize between 100 and 200 people per month from now on. If successful, this would represent a massive increase in denaturalization proceedings: from 2017 to the present, there have only been 120 cases.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/BYLQKEDK4RJYJANNY4OVYXV63Y.jpg?auth=91d8efcb19c969180c8b8fd84b256e19237b55cfa541b7a19a3d8e0f6ac7ee8a&width=1200,N,,2025-12-18 10:00:29.457294

“Put simply, only citizens who consented to be governed could claim the rights necessary to govern themselves,” he wrote.
“This is a startling read of history [and] precedent,” according to Pepperdine Law professor Jake Charles.
“It's hard not to read this in the context of what Trump is doing.
Judge Thapar is, I’m sure, auditioning for the next open Supreme Court seat.","A federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump has argued that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to noncitizen immigrants, claiming that the founding principle of “We the people” extends only to American citizens.

Appeals court Judge Amul Thapar, who Trump put on a short list of contenders for a Supreme Court nomination during his first term, argued this week that “the people” refers only to “citizens of the United States who consented to its government.”

Thapar partially agreed with the majority’s ruling to uphold a federal law that blocks immigrants who entered the United States without legal permission from possessing firearms.

But Thapar went further, arguing that the founders did not intend for the Second Amendment — nor the First and Fourth Amendments — to extend to noncitizens, “let alone illegal aliens.”

His dissenting view carries no legal weight, but it was published as the Trump administration looks to the courts for support amid an avalanche of lawsuits against a sweeping anti-immigration agenda that has deported thousands of people while severely limiting who can enter the U.S.

Law enforcement officers across the country are accused of depriving immigrants of their constitutional rights with sweeping arrests and detentions, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, while the Trump administration is attempting to unilaterally redefine who gets to be a citizen by rewriting the 14th Amendment.

The administration also is facing legal challenges from noncitizen scholars who argue the government unlawfully retaliated against them for demonstrating against Israel’s war in Gaza by throwing them in immigration detention centers and threatening them with removal from the country, in violation of their First Amendment rights.

In this case, Guatemalan citizen Milder Escobar-Temal challenged his conviction for unlawfully possessing firearms that police discovered in his home in 2022.

Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch, who wrote the majority opinion for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, argued that the noncitizens who enter the country without legal permission are granted constitutional rights once they develop “substantial connections with this country.”

But Thapar disagreed, writing that “historical traditions don’t just support the exclusion of illegal aliens — they demand it.”

Only U.S. citizens enjoy Second Amendment rights, he argued. The First and Fourth Amendments, which protect the rights to free speech and affirm protections against reasonable searches and seizures, respectively, were also “originally understood” to apply only to citizens, according to Thapar.

“Put simply, only citizens who consented to be governed could claim the rights necessary to govern themselves,” he wrote.

He also questioned the majority’s reasoning that constitutional protections for noncitizens who have “substantial connections with this country,” stating that the courts should “stay out of the moralizing business of judging what makes an American.”

“Why should courts get to pick and choose what connections make someone American?” Thapar wrote as he defended which constitutional rights to deprive noncitizens.

“This is a startling read of history [and] precedent,” according to Pepperdine Law professor Jake Charles. “It's hard not to read this in the context of what Trump is doing. Judge Thapar is, I’m sure, auditioning for the next open Supreme Court seat. … It’s a really alarming project of trying to decimate the rights of noncitizens at the precise moment when the administration is punishing speech [and] subjecting noncitizens to unreasonable searches and seizures.”

Thapar was among 10 finalists for consideration for the Supreme Court during Trump’s first term. From that list, the president nominated Neil Gorsuch, who was the first of Trump’s three appointments to the nation’s highest court, which has a firm six-member conservative majority with three liberal justices.

Thapar also served on an 18-member “judicial advisory board” for the Heritage Foundation’s clause-by-clause analysis of the Constitution, serving as a legal manifesto to accompany the right-wing think-tank’s Project 2025 blueprint to support the Trump administration’s second term.

Jamelle Bouie, a columnist for The New York Times, called Thapar’s latest dissent “historical and legal fan fiction” designed to “vindicate Trump's lawlessness.”

Trump’s allies celebrated Thapar’s writing, with legal ally Mike Davis stating that “We the People” means “the sovereign citizens.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/17/15/46/-BESTPIX-Department-Of-Homeland-Security-Formally-Announces-Start-Of-Immigration-Enforcement-In-New.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-12-18 11:58:28.641623

Saba Capital Master Fund, Ltd. The case, in which the Court granted certiorari on June 30, 2025, involves a circuit split over whether there is an implied private right of action in Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA) for private litigants to bring suit to rescind contracts alleged to violate the ICA. The Skadden team, arguing against such a private right of action, also includes Parker Rider-Longmaid, Steven Marcus, Sherry Tanious, Scott Musoff, Eben Colby and Marley Ann Brumme.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the primary authority to enforce the ICA, which regulates registered investment companies such as closed-end funds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Saba Capital Master Fund sued several closed-end funds, arguing that the funds violated the ICA by adopting certain governance provisions in their bylaws designed to protect long-term investors from predatory hedge funds like Saba. Saba’s suit, filed originally in the Southern District of New York, sought to rescind the bylaws it alleged were unlawful under the ICA. The Second Circuit previously recognized an implied right of action under Section 47(b), diverging from the Third and Ninth Circuits, which had rejected such a right.

The Court’s decision could have a significant impact on private litigation involving 1940 Act registered funds. Rejecting a private right of action, as the petitioning funds argue the Court should do, would reinforce the SEC’s primary enforcement role, and maintain greater regulatory certainty for funds — an important element of this $38 trillion industry that many Americans depend on for their savings and investments. Conversely, if the Court affirms the Second Circuit’s view and finds that Section 47(b) does confer a private right of action, the plaintiffs’ bar will likely increasingly look to Section 47(b) as a means for claiming alleged violations of the ICA’s other sections.

The people wrongly deported include a man sent to Haiti nearly a month after a judge ordered the government not to remove him from the country; a man sent to Laos following a similar order that officials said they did not receive until after his plane took off; and a transgender woman taken to Mexico despite a judge’s order blocking her return there because she was at risk of being tortured.

The cases illustrate how, in President Donald Trump’s rush to deport people in record numbers, immigration officials are prone to making mistakes, immigration lawyers say. Those lawyers report seeing removals occur against judges’ orders more frequently; in some cases, they have questioned the administration’s regard for the law.

“Unlawful removals like these, and at this rate, where they're happening constantly across the country, betray an Executive that is completely unconstrained by the law, acting however it wants whenever it wants, with reckless disregard for people's lives and safety,” said Bridget Pranzatelli, an attorney for the National Immigration Project who represents people being detained in Louisiana.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not respond to multiple requests for comment but has repeatedly said its deportation campaign is making the country safer by getting criminals out of the U.S. Many recent deportees and detainees, however, do not have criminal records.

Jeremy Jong, a New Orleans-based immigration attorney, said removing people against judges’ orders is happening “more than usual because there’s so much pressure from above to keep on moving people — to move people through the system faster and faster and faster.”

Some advocates also fear that the judiciary’s response to such removals has been too tepid to deter the Trump administration from continuing the practice.

“The government should not simply be allowed to decry inadvertence and escape all consequences for their illegal ‘errors,’” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which has handled two such cases in the state. “What it shows is that such actions are worthy of nothing more than a slap on the wrist and so they will continue.”

Though it is not a border state, Louisiana is a key cog in Trump’s deportation machine due in part to its large detention capacity: the state has the second-most ICE detainees behind Texas. It also has a holding facility near an airport in Alexandria, which has become a hub for deportation flights.

Louisiana cases

In July, lawyers for a man from Haiti, who was being held in an ICE facility in Pine Prairie, filed a lawsuit arguing the man could not be legally deported or detained because he had temporary protected status.

That status is sometimes granted to immigrants from countries where conditions are unsafe. It allows them to work in the United States without being deported.

In response to the filings, federal Judge James D. Cain, Jr., a Trump appointee in the Western District Court of Louisiana, blocked the man’s removal from Louisiana. Officials put the man on a removal flight but halted his deportation the day Cain’s order was issued, court records show.

One month later, he was deported to Haiti anyway.

Government lawyers said the man’s removal was a mistake, the result of a miscommunication between the Chicago ICE office, which scheduled his removal, and the New Orleans ICE office, which oversaw his deportation flight.

The government said it would return the man to the U.S. after he got a Haitian passport, and Cain declined to hold ICE in contempt of court because he did not believe officials purposely violated his order, he wrote in a Sept. 16 decision.

As of Oct. 6, the man had not been returned to the U.S., his attorneys said in a brief. They did not return multiple requests for comment on the status of the man’s case, and ICE did not say whether he was back in the country.

In the months after the man’s deportation, two other Louisiana cases emerged.

Chanthila Souvannarath was deported to Laos in October after federal Judge Shelly Dick of Louisiana’s Middle District Court, a Barack Obama appointee, issued an order temporarily blocking his removal because of his claim to U.S. citizenship. Officials said they did not learn of the order until several hours after his flight left the country.

Lawyers for Souvannarath, who was initially held in a Lao jail and later released, fought for his return. Dick declined a motion to order him brought back because she found he could fight his case from Laos – still, she said, officials had violated her order, if not intentionally.

Then, in November, the U.S. deported a transgender woman to Mexico even though a judge had blocked her return there after finding she was at risk of being tortured due to her gender identity.

The government said Britania Uriostegui Rios was “inadvertently” removed. Officials allowed her back into the U.S. about a week after she was deported, according to court records.

In court filings, Uriostegui Rios’ lawyers said she briefly went into hiding in Mexico and feared the trip back to the border. When she first made it to a checkpoint, officials turned her away, even after the U.S. had said she would be allowed back in, her lawyers said. She was allowed in the following day, court records show.

A national drama

The Louisiana deportations come as similar cases from across the country make national headlines, sometimes raising questions about whether the administration is intentionally defying the judiciary.

Late last month, a federal judge began a criminal contempt of court investigation after the administration in March left hundreds of Venezuelan migrants in El Salvador despite his order not to.

Attorneys for the government argued they did not violate the judge’s order because his directive to turn the migrants’ flights around in mid-air was verbal and was not included in his written order.

The contempt investigation has been paused after an appeals court temporarily granted the Trump administration’s request to halt the proceedings.

On Dec. 5, a federal judge in Texas called a man’s deportation to Guatemala “blatant lawlessness” because, over a decade beforehand, an immigration judge had blocked the man’s return there. The judge, David Guaderrama, an Obama appointee, ordered the government to bring the man back to the U.S.; officials told Guaderrama the man returned on Dec. 11, according to a Dec. 16 ruling. The man’s attorney declined to comment.

Three other cases have also drawn national attention.

In March, the Trump administration sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador even though a judge had blocked his return to that country after finding he had a reasonable fear of gang persecution. Officials called his deportation an “administrative error” and ultimately returned him to the U.S. following a court order.

In June, a New York federal appeals court ordered the government to return Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron, who was deported to El Salvador about half an hour after the court canceled his removal order. Melgar-Salmeron was briefly held in Louisiana ahead of his deportation flight, the Investigative Post, a New York state-based news outlet, reported.

And in November, a 19-year-old college student who came to the U.S. at age 8 and was flying home to Texas to surprise her family for Thanksgiving was detained at Boston Logan International Airport.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a “clear defeat” for Paxton.

“The court saw this lawsuit for exactly what it was: a cheap political stunt designed to score headlines,” Menefee said. “Harris County will not be intimidated or pushed around by state officials who are more interested in pandering than governing.”

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He asked the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: After Tuesday’s ruling, Menefee accused Paxton of cherry-picking facts about the program and ignoring its “clear public purpose.”

“These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,” Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said. “Making sure they can resolve their immigration status strengthens our economy, keeps families together, and makes our community safer.”

In a statement, Menefee and members of the Harris County Commissioners’ Court accused Paxton of using this program to bolster his conservative credentials during a heated primary for U.S. Senate.

“Providing legal support to immigrants who are trying to ‘do it the right way’ was never a concern to the Attorney General’s Office,” Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. “That is, until Ken Paxton decided to run for higher office.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.""",https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/i_d36o-TLhJp_K6K428HcwvmiVGyOmAyj8ltBZcdp54yp4M8MM2va5dN2jzEpAuvvDCbDDBRHJQjBBA8z9GUQAB2eOtrrRcCPPi5cyr9tjeqaScOZrcbr8dP0NYd4PsbhEfRvmKTbZUSDj8wMt97wq,N,,2025-12-18 10:58:10.327484

The National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA) was approved in a 77-20 vote on Wednesday with senators adopting legislation passed by the House of Representatives last month. It now goes to Trump for his signature.

Several provisions in the bill reflect efforts by Democratic lawmakers, supported by some Republicans, to constrain how quickly the Trump administration may scale back US military commitments in Europe.

The bill requires the Pentagon to maintain at least 76,000 US soldiers in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted and the administration determines that a reduction would be in the US national interest. The US typically stations 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers across the continent. A similar measure prevents reductions in US troop levels in South Korea below 28,500 soldiers.

Congress also reinforced its backing for Ukraine, authorising $800m under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative with $400m allocated for each of the next two years. A further $400m per year was approved to manufacture weapons for Ukraine, signalling continued congressional support for Kyiv and cementing Washington’s commitment to Europe’s defence.

Asia Pacific focus, congressional oversight

The bill also reflects priorities aligned with the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which places the Asia Pacific at the centre of US foreign policy and describes the region as a key economic and geopolitical battleground.

In line with that approach, the NDAA provides $1bn for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative, aimed at strengthening defence cooperation as the US seeks to counter China’s growing military influence.

The legislation authorises $600m in security assistance for Israel, including funding for joint missile defence programmes, such as the Iron Dome, a measure that has long drawn broad bipartisan support in Congress.

The NDAA increases reporting requirements on US military activity, an area in which Democrats in particular have sought greater oversight.

It directs the Department of Defense to provide Congress with additional information on strikes targeting suspected smuggling and trafficking operations in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, adding pressure on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video footage of US strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats operating in international waters near Venezuela.

Lawmakers moved to strengthen oversight after a September strike killed two people who had survived an earlier attack on their boat.

Some Democratic lawmakers said they were not briefed in advance on elements of the campaign, prompting calls for clearer reporting requirements.

Sanctions and America First

The legislation repeals the 2003 authorisation for the US invasion of Iraq and the 1991 authorisation for the Gulf War. Supporters from both parties said the repeals reduce the risk of future military action being undertaken without explicit congressional approval.

The bill also permanently lifts US sanctions on Syria imposed during the regime of President Bashar al-Assad after the Trump administration’s earlier decision to temporarily ease restrictions. Supporters argue the move will support Syria’s reconstruction after al-Assad’s removal from power a year ago.

Other provisions align more closely with priorities advanced by Trump and Republican lawmakers under the administration’s America First agenda.

The NDAA eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion offices and training programmes within the Department of Defense, including the role of chief diversity officer. The House Armed Services Committee claims the changes would save about $40m.

The bill also cuts $1.6bn from Pentagon programmes related to climate change.

While the court emphasized that it has authority to order reliquidation if tariffs are found unlawful, businesses should understand the limitations of the government’s assurances and why filing a lawsuit remains important if you want to preserve your ability to get a tariff refund.

Key Points from the Decision

• The court denied the injunction because plaintiffs could not show irreparable harm.

• The Department of Justice (DOJ) stated it will not contest the court’s authority to order reliquidation, but this is not a guarantee of DOJ support of issuance of refunds.

• Judicial estoppel may prevent the government from reversing its position later, but this does not create an automatic refund process.

What the Government Actually Promised

The government’s concessions in the court’s recent decision may sound reassuring, but they are limited in scope. DOJ only promised not to contest the court’s power to order reliquidation of tariff entries—not that it will agree to refunds without litigation. There is no commitment that the United States will not challenge the right to reliquidation or refund, for example. Unless the Supreme Court addresses this issue directly or a new procedure is established, filing a lawsuit remains the best way to preserve a claim for tariff relief.

Why Filing Still Matters

Without a lawsuit, there is currently no mechanism for a court order requiring Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to reliquidate entries or issue refunds. While the government could create a new process, it does not exist now. Companies should act promptly—waiting until entries are liquidated or finalized may make the path forward more complex.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14565_3925.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 01:06:41.132264

Tensions have been rising in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as federal authorities continue an immigration crackdown focused on the region’s Somali community, the largest in the country.

Onlooker video of the confrontation Monday in a Minneapolis neighborhood showed people yelling at Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to release the woman, claiming she is pregnant and couldn’t breathe. After kneeling on her, an agent later dragged the woman by one arm on her back toward a vehicle.

“Let her go! Let her go!” onlookers yelled as the agent dragged the woman at an intersection close to a Somali business district. The woman was let go.

Police Chief Brian O’Hara told a news conference Tuesday that city police were called to the confrontation by a federal agent who said officers needed help.

When police arrived, they did not see violence against federal officers and left in an effort to de-escalate the situation, O’Hara said. He added that “other law enforcement agencies” may have been using “questionable methods.”

“We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation,” O’Hara said. “But unfortunately that is not, that is often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city.”

Lauryn Spencer was driving on her lunch break when she heard whistles and honking, which observers have used to warn others of an ICE presence.

She said she approached the scene and began recording immediately, but was shoved back by an officer when she tried asking the woman on the ground what her name was. Spencer said she and others in the crowd were also sprayed with chemical irritants by one of the agents.

“They were being very aggressive from the beginning, like there was never a time where they attempted to use diplomacy,” she said. “I didn’t see anybody throw any hard items. The snowballs were definitely being thrown, but we didn’t start throwing snowballs until they started dragging her around by her wrist.”

Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said federal officers were targeting a vehicle when protesters “threw rocks, chunks of ice, assaulted officers and used pepper spray” against the officers. The officers sustained multiple injuries including cuts, McLaughlin said in a statement, adding that two people were charged with assaulting federal officers and remain in custody.

Officers tried to arrest the woman shown in the video because she “rushed an ICE vehicle and attempted to vandalize it,” but the officers abandoned the arrest after being swarmed by protesters, McLaughlin said.

Hodan Hassan, a former Minnesota state legislator, said she believes ICE tactics are becoming more harsh as the Minneapolis-St. Paul operation continues.

The investigation emerged out of the Feeding Our Future investigation; state spending on autism services exploded by 3,000% in recent years.","As the Walz administration clamps down on fraud in state-run Medicaid programs, service providers are fighting back in court.

At least half a dozen providers have sued the state Department of Human Services in recent months over suspended payments, which they say have either shut down their businesses or put them at existential risk, harming the clients who depend on their services.

One lawsuit filed in August in district court was dismissed in early December. In another suit in October, a personal care assistant filed suit and DHS resumed Medicaid payments a week later.

A lawsuit from a provider against DHS from September is ongoing, and three additional lawsuits were filed just last week.

The litigation is yet another fallout from the Walz administration’s focus on rooting out fraud in public programs after years of inaction, beginning with the now-notorious Feeding Our Future case that led to more than 75 federal charges and has since morphed into a wide-ranging Medicaid fraud investigation.

The stakes are significant: Successful litigation could encourage more providers to sue, which would complicate the administration’s efforts to thwart the burgeoning fraud scandal — and with it, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2026 reelection efforts.

Provider lawsuit dismissed by district court

A district court dismissed a lawsuit from Empathy Home Care in August in which the provider alleged that DHS stopped payments for its assisted living services starting in May but offered no evidence of fraud.

Michael Schwartz, Empathy Home Care’s attorney, said that “the state’s response to allegations of widespread fraud is being dealt with by just shutting payments off to a whole blanket of people, including Empathy, who’ve done nothing wrong.”

According to a court memo from the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, evidence gathered by DHS indicated that Empathy Home Care billed for services that it didn’t provide. The memo also said that DHS had evidence that Medicaid recipients went missing when services were supposed to be provided and overdosed without staff attempting to save them.

Much of Empathy’s legal argument rests on a new section in Minnesota statute that limits payment stoppages from all state agencies to 60 days if there’s evidence of fraud. But an older Minnesota statute, which applies specifically to Medicaid-funded services, allows DHS to impose sanctions on Medicaid providers until “the commissioner determines there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the individual or entity, or after legal proceedings relating to the alleged fraud are completed.”

The Minnesota 4th District Court ruled in early December that the older statute is in force, allowing DHS to continue to withhold payment beyond the 60 days allowed in the new statute. Historically, under the older statute, state and federal courts have not allowed Medicaid program providers the right to appeal payment sanctions.

Schwartz said that Empathy plans to appeal the court’s decision this week.

Integrated Community Supports provider sues

The three providers that filed lawsuits against DHS last week range in what services they provide and why DHS suspended their payments.

Bright Community Services says it helps more than 30 adults through Integrated Community Support services, a program that has been under scrutiny by DHS. The program started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution.

Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS paused payments for some ICS providers starting in September and implementing a prepayment auditing process this month for 14 programs, including ICS.

DHS has withheld payments to 17 ICS providers as of late November. Bright Community Services was one of them — but, like Empathy Home Care, the business alleges that DHS suspended its payments without explanation. It also said that it asked DHS “on numerous occasions” for further explanation of the fraud allegation but received no response.

Bright Community Services has stopped offering services because it’s now unable to pay staff, according to the lawsuit. DHS has said that providers are still allowed to continue providing services while they stop payments.

“No business can reasonably be expected to do that,” reads the lawsuit from Bright Community Services.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed in a statement that all payments to Bright Community Services were suspended based on “credible allegations of fraud,” which have also been referred to law enforcement. The statement also said that payments may resume if the provider submits sufficient information to demonstrate that there was no fraud.

Lataa Elemo, who operates Bright Community Services, declined an interview request. So far, no providers have faced state or federal charges for defrauding ICS.

DHS investigating connections between different providers

DHS is also investigating and pausing payments for providers affiliated with other providers suspected of fraud.

Two Medicaid program providers partly owned by the same person, Suleiman Isse — Joy Home Healthcare and Hennepin Autism Center — filed a lawsuit against DHS in September over payments halted in June.

DHS said in a notice that it suspended payments to Hennepin Autism in part because it had evidence that the autism center participated in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which the autism center denied. DHS additionally suspended payments to Joy Home Healthcare because of its shared ownership with Hennepin Autism.

A previous Reformer analysis of state records found that a Feeding Our Future defendant, Yusuf Bashir Ali, was an officer of the Hennepin Autism Center in 2020. Ali was removed as an officer two years later — a couple of months after he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering in the Feeding Our Future case.

That lawsuit is ongoing. The attorney representing the providers declined to comment.

Another provider, Agape Home Care Services, received a notice from DHS in September that the business was cut off from payments because of its affiliation with another provider under investigation for fraud, Healthy Living Home Care, according to another recent lawsuit.

Agape doesn’t provide ICS services but does provide other home- and community-based services, as well as nursing services, that are also paid through state-run Medicaid programs.

Michael Hunter, the co-owner of Agape, said that he owns 30% of Healthy Living Home Care but plays no part in the business operations of Healthy Living.

“Because someone has a stake in another company, you put another whole company on payment hold,” Hunter said. “We are not being accused of any wrongdoing, nothing like that.”

Since the payment hold started, Agape has had to stop providing services to all of its clients, Hunter said. The organization usually has 10 to 15 clients, many of whom have intense behavioral and medical needs and were sent to the hospital once services stopped, he said.

Hunter said that Healthy Living Home Care is still waiting to hear why their payments are being withheld. According to Hunter, DHS surveyed Healthy Living but “there was nothing on fraud” in the survey.

DHS and government officials have provided limited information, citing active investigations.

“Hopefully it’s understandable that we don’t want to be too forthcoming about what kinds of actions cause investigators to suspect someone is billing for services they didn’t provide, but in general we look for patterns of concern,” said a DHS spokesperson, in an email.

As in Empathy’s case, Agape’s lawsuit and another lawsuit recently filed by Benevolence LLC, an autism services provider, make the case that DHS can only stop payments for 60 days under the new statute.

A representative from Benevolence LLC declined to comment.

Federal investigators have charged one person for defrauding the autism program. The investigation emerged out of the Feeding Our Future investigation; state spending on autism services exploded by 3,000% in recent years.

Suing the state has been a successful strategy in the past

In yet another lawsuit, a personal care assistant alleged in October that her payments for taking care of her disabled son were suspended two years ago, and that she wasn’t given information or a timeline on DHS’s fraud investigation.

Joseph Dixon, the attorney for the personal care assistant, said that DHS “simply withdrew the payment suspension” rather than respond to the lawsuit, making the case moot.

Feeding Our Future, the nonprofit at the center of a $250 million scheme defrauding the federal government of pandemic money intended to feed children, filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Minnesota Department of Education when the agency stopped processing applications for new meal sites. Feeding Our Future accused the agency of discriminating on the basis of race, national origin and religion.

Though the judge hearing the case never issued a written order for the Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future, he did say the state did not have authority to stop payments, according to a transcript of a 2021 hearing reviewed by the Star Tribune. Though stopped payments were outside of the purview of the lawsuit, which centered on meal site applications, MDE resumed payments six days later.

In 2022, MDE said in a statement that “the court made it clear that if MDE were to continue the legal fight to withhold payments, MDE would incur sanctions and legal penalties.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-PHOTO-fraud-committee-MJ-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 01:06:16.611625

Twenty-four-year-old Vanessa Parazall had just finished dropping her daughter off at Pinehurst Elementary School, when she was suddenly swarmed by ICE agents in unmarked cars. Her neighbor, Elizabeth Watkins, was traveling behind her when the confrontation began.

In a video, captured by Watkins, at least six men, wearing masks and tactical gear, are seen trying to pull Parazall from her vehicle. When Watkins questions the officers’ activity, one agent tells her that Parazall “is illegal and she has aggravated charges.” Parazall was ultimately detained by authorities, and her vehicle was damaged in the process.

Parazall’s sister-in-law, Sophia Livingston, alleges that the father of Parazall’s daughter called ICE on her because of an ongoing custody dispute.

“She called me earlier, I could barely understand her from how upset she was. She said, ‘Please protect my child, please protect my family,'” Livingston says. “Her daughter has not seen her dad in over a year [and] her daughter does not want to go with her dad.”

Parents and community members promptly organized a protest outside of the elementary school during pickup hours. One community member, Olivia Wackett, expressed her shock after attending an event at the school just a week prior.

“It’s so jarring to have gone from experiencing that and feeling this true sense of belonging, community, loving and supporting one another to look out of my window and see this car completely bashed in,” Wackett says. “This has a ripple effect; it’s not just the person that was ripped from their car this morning that this has impacted… it’s our entire community it’s our children that are being impacted by this.”

In a statement to WMDT, Wicomico County Public Schools acknowledged this morning’s detainment, stating, “This incident did not take place on school property, and there was no disruption to school operations. In compliance with Wicomico County Board of Education policies, procedures, and applicable legal directives, only individuals legally authorized to access students may initiate any form of contact with a student.”

We have to rise to the occasion.” Know your rights The increased presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is a major issue for multiple multilingual community radio stations and their communities, Dael said.
“To be a volunteer at a community radio station, no one asks your status of citizenship or being here legally or illegally.
Numerous stations have adopted and distributed red cards among volunteers, she said.
“We have tens of thousands of our people who don’t have access to real information in real time, and I think community radio stations should play a role.” Perez said community radio stations like KYMZ must continue their indispensable service during uncertain times, as many Spanish-speaking communities depend on stations for news and information.","Spanish-language and multilingual community radio stations nationwide are adapting how they serve their communities and volunteers in response to the Trump administration’s intensified crackdowns on immigration.

Multiple stations have been at the forefront of providing local audiences with up-to-date immigration-related news and information to make sense of the oftentimes armed, masked and plainclothed federal agents forcefully detaining loved ones and other community members.

Amid these enforcement activities, such as the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, station staffers say they feel they must walk a line between providing information necessary to navigate new norms without inviting unwanted attention or potential retaliation.

Rima Dael, CEO of the National Federation of Community Broadcasters, said staffers at many of these stations, many of whom are people of color, are feeling anxious as they find the best route forward while the Trump administration attacks and dehumanizes nonwhite people.

“Talking to some stations, some of the conversations are, ‘How can we continue to speak out against the current administration?’” Dael said. “Then, the tension arises of … ‘Let’s de-escalate talking about those issues so there isn’t a target on the station’s back,’ because they want to be a safe haven and refuge for people of marginalized and historically underrepresented identities.”

Radio Bilingüe, the California-based Spanish-language radio network that broadcasts in parts of the U.S. and Mexico, is one of the outlets working to ensure its communities have reliable access to vital information about public health, labor rights and immigration as they face uncertainty under the Trump administration.

Though the network is among the organizations strained by Congress’ rescission of $1.1 billion in CPB funds, Co-Executive Director José Martínez-Saldaña said it remains committed to empowering its communities, no matter the obstacles.

“We are tightening our belt where we can, but we have no plans and no interest in scaling back what we do,” Martínez-Saldaña said. “The information and the content that we provide locally as well as nationally couldn’t be more critical than at this time. We have to rise to the occasion.”

Know your rights

The increased presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is a major issue for multiple multilingual community radio stations and their communities, Dael said.

“These are stations … that might be all volunteer-driven,” Dael said. “To be a volunteer at a community radio station, no one asks your status of citizenship or being here legally or illegally. It’s, ‘Hey, you live in the community? You want to be on the radio? You want to be part of this community hub? Come right in!’”

Dael said numerous stations are working to ensure undocumented people within volunteer bases and the community know their rights in light of increased ICE presences.

She said NFCB has directed Spanish-language member stations to training on the use of red cards, small index cards created to assert one’s rights — regardless of citizenship status — and protect against potential constitutional violations by ICE agents. Numerous stations have adopted and distributed red cards among volunteers, she said.

One of these stations is WNHH 103.5 FM in New Haven, Conn. John Lugo, a station host and the co-founder and community organizing director of local immigration advocacy group Unidad Latina en Acción, has been leading the effort to hand out red cards within the station and in the community through his organization.

“ULA definitely has done the outreach,” said Norma Rodriguez-Reyes, the station’s chair and host of the bilingual program K Pasa. “They have literally gone door to door to pass these things out.”

Lugo said that while red cards are a start, immigrant and Latin American communities also need consistent, up-to-date information to keep pace with a rapidly evolving political climate.

“The red card is pretty limited,” Lugo said, adding that the community needs to know about “what’s going on at the national or federal level.”

Likewise, Radio KDNA 91.9 FM, a Spanish-language variety community station based in Granger, Wash., has relentlessly distributed red cards in the community since the spring, said Francisco Ríos, the station’s lead and news director.

“Many families have come to pick up one of these cards,” Ríos said. “At our community events that are held with other organizations, such as schools and community clinics, we’re also there distributing the red cards.”

Like WNHH, Ríos said KDNA is working to go beyond the red cards. He said providing the community with comprehensive information through “a series of messages that continue to educate and prepare families regarding all possible scenarios that may arise in the matter of migration” significantly adds to the objective of red cards.

“This is so families, in the case of an eventual deportation, ensure their children are well protected,” Ríos said.

Disseminating information

To keep communities informed about issues like ICE presence, Dael said that multiple Spanish-language stations are doing their best to continue serving communities while “staying under the radar of the current administration.”

She said many stations are keeping low profiles by collaborating with local community groups, such as immigration and refugee-serving organizations, to keep the community informed and to reduce the risk of being “seen as doing anything just themselves.”

“There’s a feeling that doing things collaboratively provides protection for some community radio stations,” Dael said.

Among these stations is KDNA. Ríos said the station receives five to 10 calls daily from community members seeking information about local immigrant rights groups or legal resources for recently detained loved ones.

KDNA has amped up relationships with organizations like the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project, a statewide immigrant advocacy nonprofit organization that provides migrants with legal services and community education. The station regularly features the organization on air to provide legal advice for navigating the current administration and obtaining legal status.

Similarly, WNHH airs La Voz del Migrante, a Spanish-language program focused on immigration-related news on the national, state and local levels, in partnership with Unidad Latina en Acción, which Lugo hosts one to two times a week. Lugo said the program regularly advises listeners on topics such as sorting legal documents and creating emergency plans in case of detention.

“Another topic that we talk on all the time with our communities is, don’t go to the court by yourself. Try to get help. Try to get connected with other groups,” Lugo said. “This is the time not to be alone. This is the time to build more community, to work together.”

KYMZ 99.9 FM Radio Sin Fronteras, a Spanish-language community station in Somerton, Ariz., is taking direction from its farmworker-oriented grassroots parent organization, Campesinos Sin Fronteras, to ensure its community stays informed about ICE operations.

Gregorio Perez, the station’s director of programming, said that although the station cannot tell listeners what to do or where to go, it relays information from Campesinos Sin Fronteras to give listeners the tools necessary to operate with caution.

“They’ll inform us, ‘You know what? There’s a campaign happening in such and such park at such and such place,’ so we just say, ‘Please friends, be careful in that area, you must take precautions,’” Perez said. “We try to disguise the message.”

Radio Bilingüe is working to ensure its network of 30 noncommercial stations and 75 affiliates has consistent and reliable access to information. Martínez-Saldaña said the network has recently brought on legal experts and immigration advocates to inform listeners of their rights and how to handle ICE encounters, hoping to ease “a little bit of that tension that exists.”

“We know that there is a lot of fear about the raids that have taken place,” Martínez-Saldaña said. “It’s experts that we bring on board that share, ‘Here are the things that you can do to protect yourself.’ We are the conduit of that information. The anxieties, we know, are in the community, and so we’re just trying to be a calm voice of reason.”

The station featured ​​Yanira Arias, program manager for the national immigrant community nonprofit Alianza Americas, on an episode of its Sin Fronteras program May 8 to discuss children with U.S. citizenship who had recently been deported along with their foreign-born parents. On the show, Arias analyzed the legality of ICE’s actions and advised undocumented families to get in contact with local organizations.

“This is an illegal action by the Donald Trump government,” Arias said on the show. “To the immigrants who find themselves in a similar situation, this is why it’s very important to reach out to community-based organizations to prepare family-emergency plans.”

Likewise, WNHH has brought on multiple immigration attorneys to speak to the community, Rodriguez-Reyes said. She said that the station also regularly brings local religious leaders on air, who offer reassurance and inspire hope in the Latin American community in the face of ICE raids. She added that faith-based organizations resonate deeply within the community.

“The Latino community has a very high percentage of people that attend church,” Rodriguez-Reyes said.

In addition to informing the community, Perez said KYMZ guides vulnerable community members to work with Campesinos Sin Fronteras for help with legal status issues. The organization supports community members with citizenship applications, renewing permanent residencies, initiating family-based petitions, and other immigration-related processes.

“What the organization does is invite people, if they’ve been living here, if they’re already residents, to become citizens so they can participate and vote,” Perez said. “The [administration’s] attacks are severe and brutal. There is fear within the community, not just here, but throughout the country.”

‘Leading through uncertainty’

Staffers at multilingual community radio stations say they have no option but to continue providing their communities with reliable immigration-related information.

Lugo said he’s often more outspoken on his show than hosts at other stations. He said that although his directness could invite retaliation from the federal government through ICE or the FCC, he’s willing to take the risk to keep listeners informed.

“It’s necessary because ICE is not announcing when they are in the community. They just show up whenever they want to,” Lugo said. “We have tens of thousands of our people who don’t have access to real information in real time, and I think community radio stations should play a role.”

Perez said community radio stations like KYMZ must continue their indispensable service during uncertain times, as many Spanish-speaking communities depend on stations for news and information. He said community members often call the station to confirm information heard elsewhere.

“It’s part of the culture to listen to the radio [in the] early morning for whatever situation, whether it’s for music, for everything,” Perez said. “In case of any emergency, people quickly tune in to the radio to see what’s going on. And if the announcer doesn’t mention anything, the same people call in to ask, ‘What’s going on here? Is it true that this or that happened?’”

He said KYMZ has recently found itself with fewer resources to fulfill its mission to keep farmworkers, immigrants and low-income families informed, as it previously received around 15% of its approximately $250,000 budget from CPB. The station has dismissed three employees: a manager, a director of programming and a Campesinos Sin Fronteras community health worker who served as a host.

Ríos said KDNA is in a similar boat. CPB funding made up approximately 20% to 30% of the station’s roughly $2.2 million annual budget, forcing it to suspend positions across the board, from producers and equipment maintenance to community outreach and grant writers.

He said that though the station’s workforce has dropped from 19 staff to just three in recent years, KDNA’s active volunteer network needs no further motivation to keep the station running smoothly.

“Here, the companions, all of us … have somebody who could be affected by the migration agenda,” Ríos said. “Therefore, they know and understand the needs and risks in our community because they are a part of it. … They understand the importance of every resource, every word we express on KDNA’s radio programs.”

In the meantime, Martinez-Saldaña said organizations like Radio Bilingüe have no choice but to ensure their communities remain informed.

“The alternative is you close the doors and go hide,” he said. “That’s not an option for us. Too many people depend on us, and so that’s our motivation. Our community needs us, but we need them as well.”

Her case is like many others we've seen where people are somewhere in the middle — they have immigration paperwork or are somewhere in the middle.

Vilma Palacios has been held at the ICE detention center in Basile for nearly six months, after being arrested by immigration agents on June 26. She says the experience has been emotionally exhausting and something she would never wish on anyone.

“In here it has been a mix of emotions, a lot of ups and downs especially since the beginning I didn’t think I was going to be here for such a long time,"" Palacios told us over the phone from the detention center.

Palacios came to the United States from Honduras when she was 7 years old. After living in California, her family eventually settled in Louisiana, where she graduated from high school and later earned a nursing degree from LSU.

""I know her to be a high achiever academically. I know that she performed well in school and was a servant leader in school. She was a student ambassador and earned a peer mentor award,"" Matt Reese, Palacios' former nursing instructor said.

At the time of her detention, Palacios says she was actively renewing her work permit. Her previous authorization expired in March 2024, but she says she first applied for renewal in 2023. That process, she says, took nearly a year to receive a response. By the time she heard back, Palacios says there was confusion and someone handling her case believed it had been terminated. She submitted another renewal application and received confirmation in January of this year that it had been received.

“I had already sent an application to renew my work permit, and it was still in the process,” Palacios said.

Just days before she was detained, Palacios passed her registered nursing certification exam. She had already accepted a job offer at Touro and was preparing to begin her career.

Those who know her say her detention is devastating.

“I know the system needs there’s things that need to be fixed we need to protect our borders but at the same time you have someone like her,"" Rosemary Cortes, her aunt, said. ""For us not to embrace someone like her, it’s heartbreaking. Here’s a perfect example of someone who has given so much to our community, her family, her friends, and we don’t want them here? That doesn’t make sense.”

Reese and Cortes are hoping she will be released soon. Reese says Palacios represents exactly the type of healthcare worker communities desperately need amid the nursing shortage.

“Vilma is ready to step up to the plate,” he said. “She is a compassionate and well-trained nurse she wants to give back to the community.”

But after nearly six months in detention, Palacios says the mental and emotional toll has become overwhelming.

“I’ve become very exhausted being in this place mentally, it's emotionally draining,” she said.

Now, Palacios says she is considering self-deportation, even though she considers the United States her home.

“The laws aren't getting any better and they aren’t taking into consideration everything I’ve done in this country, the community ties I have, my family, everything. The amount of years I’ve been here, that I’ve tried to do everything right,"" she said. ""They don’t take nothing into consideration and my plan is going back to Honduras.""

“This is a new level of violence than we’ve seen in the city,” said Jaime Martinez, executive director of Frontline DIGNITY, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrants.

Martinez said he spoke with witnesses who saw the incident unfold.

According to accounts given to Martinez and to TribLive, two unmarked vehicles sandwiched a white Tacoma pickup on the 400 block of Norton Street.

They said agents broke the truck’s driver’s side window, pulled a man from the car and got into a physical altercation with him.

At least some of the agents on the scene were from U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, according to Pittsburgh police.

Neighbors who saw the incident — including some who recorded it — said the agents punched the man and shoved him to the ground.

The truck — with an American flag decal in the back window — was still parked along Norton Street on Wednesday afternoon with a shattered driver’s side window.

Martinez said witnesses told him that agents pinned the man — who he could not identify — to the ground, even as he told them he could not breathe.

Pepper spray was deployed and seemed to get in the eyes of both the man being detained and at least one immigration agent.

One witness said he believed an ICE agent had been the one to pull out the pepper spray.

The man being detained was put in the back of an SUV, witnesses said, and not permitted to take water from a neighbor offering to help him clean out his eyes after the pepper spray.

The man was later moved to a van and driven away, witnesses said.

Two witnesses told TribLive they recognized the man and his truck from the neighborhood but did not know him personally.

As he was being led to the van, the man yelled in Spanish asking if he could take his phone.

Peter Blazak, 33, said he heard noises and saw flashing lights outside his home around 8 a.m.

“It looks like they were kind of wrestling with him,” Blazak said of the scene he saw unfold outside his home in what he described as a usually quiet street. “I heard a lot of screaming and shouting. It didn’t sound peaceful.”

Blazak said the man seemed to be kicking at the door or window of the van after agents had handcuffed him and put him in the vehicle.

A neighbor called Pittsburgh police, who were not initially on the scene when ICE detained the man.

Video obtained by TribLive shows several city police officers and at least one paramedic.

Martinez said he did not believe Pittsburgh police were cooperating with immigration officials. Witnesses said local police did not seem to assist ICE even after they arrived on scene.

Cara Cruz, a Pittsburgh public safety spokeswoman, said police responded to the 400 block of Norton Street around 8:25 a.m. “following multiple calls for an individual fighting with unknown law enforcement officers in the street.”

Medics arrived to evaluate “all parties,” including ICE agents and the man who was the “target of their operation,” Cruz said in a statement.

“Of note, Pittsburgh police is not apprised of ICE activity, such as federal administrative warrant service, in the City of Pittsburgh and does not assist ICE agents with such operations,” Cruz said. “Pittsburgh police officers respond to emergency calls for service in their jurisdiction.”

In January, Mayor Ed Gainey said Pittsburgh would not work with ICE.

“My administration will not work with ICE,” Gainey said during a PA Press Club event in Harrisburg. “We will do whatever’s necessary to make our city more welcoming. That’s what we’re built on.”

The state's ACLU chapter said it was filing the lawsuit on behalf of six community members. In a release, the organization said agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with other agencies, have ""engaged in a series of indiscriminate immigration raids in which masked federal officers in militarized gear brandish rifles and abduct community members from local businesses, streets, and homes.""

The ACLU also alleges the agents have interfered with community members' right to free speech via ""harassment, intimidation, force, and detention,"" such as by using rubber bullets and chemical irritants and arresting observers and protesters.

""This lawsuit asks the court — on behalf of these ordinary people who have come together courageously to stand up for the rights of all Americans — to halt ICE's attack on First and Fourth Amendment rights,"" the ACLU said.

ACLU staff attorney Alicia Granse said the suit asks the court to declare the agents' behavior unlawful and issue an order prohibiting them from carrying out that behavior. The ACLU will also seek a temporary restraining order while the court adjudicates the case.

One of the suit's plaintiffs, Susan Tincher, said she went to observe ICE activity in her Minneapolis neighborhood on Dec. 9, and within 15 seconds of her arrival, she was ""on the ground in handcuffs.""

""There was no warning, no explanation, no chance to comply,"" Tincher said.

Tincher said she was taken to a facility where she was ""put in shackles"" and ""held for five hours"" before being released.

""I did not obstruct. I did not disobey. I did not provoke violence,"" Tincher said. ""I was on a public street and what followed was sudden, brutal and terrifying.""

WCCO has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

ICE agents surged into the Twin Cities for an enhanced enforcement operation earlier this month at the direction of the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security said agents have made more than 400 arrests since then.

The agents have drawn the ire of both community members and Minneapolis city leaders. On Tuesday, Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized ICE after agents held a woman down and dragged her along the ground in south Minneapolis. Agents also deployed chemical irritants, and at one point, an agent used a Taser before yelling, ""Who wants more?"" to a gathered crowd.

""We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation, but unfortunately that is … often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city,"" O'Hara said.

ICE said agents ""conducted themselves with the utmost professionalism"" in responding to the crowd throwing snow and other objects.

O'Hara joined Mayor Jacob Frey and small business owners on Tuesday to discuss how ICE's presence is economically detrimental to the city.

ACLU of Minnesota Executive Director Deepinder Mayell said the organization will announce further legal action on Thursday.

""Since the launch of Operation Metro Surge, we have witnessed a remarkable string of unlawful activity targeting Minnesota communities and Minnesota values,"" Mayell said. ""This affects us all.""

Before Ashley’s testimony, Judge Kristela Cervera testified against Dugan on Tuesday. Ashley’s time on the witness stand wasn’t nearly as adversarial, and bolstered the defense case in significant respects.

Prosecutors claim that the emails and draft show Dugan exceeding her authority as a state court judge, but jurors also heard Ashley’s scathing criticism about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations can “significantly damage the integrity of the court system.”

“The presence of ICE agents can deter individuals, particularly immigrants and marginalized communities, from attending court hearings, seeking legal assistance, or reporting crimes,” Ashley wrote in a press release on April 6. “This undermines the fundamental right to access the courts and seek legal remedies.”

The press release lists three harms to the state judiciary: “Chilling Effect on Access to Justice,” “Erosion of Trust in the Judicial System,” and “Confusion over Legal Protections.”

“When individuals perceive courthouses as unsafe due to the fear of detention, trust in the judicial system erodes,” Ashley wrote. “This can lead to a reluctance to engage with law enforcement, legal representation, and the courts, ultimately hindering the administration of justice.”

Dugan’s lead attorney Steven Biskupic posed a series of questions to the chief judge about the language.

Asked whether he wanted the public and other judges to know his views, Ashley replied: “I did.”

“Is everything you wrote something you believed?” Biskupic asked.

“Yes,” he affirmed.

Later that month, a six-member team went to the 6th floor hallway of Milwaukee County Circuit Court to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a defendant before Judge Dugan. Prosecutors argue that Ashley’s guidance should have informed Dugan that the administrative warrant that they had for Flores-Ruiz’s arrest was sufficient, and they had full authority to arrest the defendant in public areas.

Asked about his view of the law, Ashley replied: “I don’t believe that I was able to stop anything in a public hallway.”

On cross-examination, however, Biskupic showed that Ashley specifically struck language used by San Francisco’s model explicitly allowing hallway arrest.

The language that Ashley declined to use for Milwaukee County Circuit Court read: “Immigration enforcement agents are allowed to conduct their operations in the Court’s Public Areas.”

Dugan is charged with felony obstruction and concealing an individual facing arrest.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bxGF!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e547e6f-a6fd-4e13-8303-e99bf242e72c_1456x1048.png",N,,2025-12-18 01:57:13.363123

We’re writing to you as members of SEIU 503 and as leaders of our Immigration Committee, but also as people who care deeply about our coworkers, our families, and our communities. Tomorrow, Thursday, December 18, our coalition partners at PCUN are calling for the first Day Without an Immigrant—a moment to stand up together as immigrant workers and allies in the face of escalating attacks from the federal government.

Across the country and here in Oregon, people are being targeted, detained, and separated from their families simply because of their names, their accents, or the color of their skin. ICE’s actions are spreading fear in our workplaces and communities, and no one should have to live with that kind of uncertainty just to go to work and care for their families.

A Day Without an Immigrant is about visibility, dignity, and solidarity. It’s a reminder that immigrants are at the heart of our union and our state. Nearly one in five workers in the U.S. is an immigrant, and in every industry—from homecare and farm work to state service and education—our labor keeps Oregon running. When immigrant workers are attacked, it hurts all of us—and when we show up together, we are powerful.

Tomorrow, Thursday, rallies will take place across Oregon in recognition of A Day Without an Immigrant. We invite you to take a break, bring a coworker, and join a rally near you to stand in solidarity with immigrant workers and their families.

This is just the beginning. A Day Without an Immigrant monthly actions will continue through April 1, and SEIU 503 will continue standing shoulder to shoulder with immigrant workers every step of the way. Together, we can reject fear and cruelty—and affirm the dignity, safety, and freedom every worker deserves.

Butte Sand Trucking Company involving a truck driver’s claims against his former employers for alleged violations of California labor law.

The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court’s rulings on class certification, the manageability of Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claims, and the applicability of federal preemption under the Motor Carrier Safety Act.

The decision provides significant guidance on the standards for class certification in wage and hour cases, the limits of trial court authority to strike PAGA claims for manageability, and the scope of federal preemption of California’s meal and rest break rules for commercial drivers.

Quick Hits

The California Court of Appeal reversed a trial court’s denial of class certification for meal break and derivative unfair competition claims, finding that the trial court had failed to apply the burden-shifting framework established in Donohue v. AMN Services, LLC.

The court affirmed the trial court’s denial of class certification for the rest break and expense reimbursement claims, holding that the evidence did not demonstrate a predominance of common issues or a community of interest among class members.

The court reversed the trial court’s order striking the plaintiff’s PAGA claim on manageability grounds.

The appellate court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether the PAGA claim was preempted by federal law, consistent with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s December 28, 2018, preemption decision and subsequent federal and state appellate authority.

Background

Plaintiff Stephen Dieves, a truck driver employed for approximately nine months in 2018, brought claims against his former employers for damages and civil penalties resulting from their alleged failures to provide meal and rest breaks and reimbursement for work-related expenses, and from their alleged violations of California’s unfair competition law. Dieves also asserted a representative claim for civil penalties under PAGA. The trial court denied class certification for all claims and granted the employers’ motion to strike the PAGA claim on manageability grounds, citing the anticipated need for individual testimony from seventy-five drivers and the lack of common evidence.

Key Holdings

Class certification—meal breaks and unfair competition. The appellate court found that the trial court had erred by not applying the Donohue burden-shifting framework to the meal break claim. Under Donohue, time records showing missed, short, or delayed meal periods with no indication that premium pay was provided create a rebuttable presumption of a violation. Dieves’s evidence—including time records, expert analysis, and declarations—was sufficient to trigger this presumption. The burden then shifted to the employer defendants to show that individual issues predominated, such as voluntary choice or unrecorded breaks. The appellate court held that the trial court’s failure to apply this framework was prejudicial, requiring reversal and remand for reconsideration of class certification for the meal break and derivative unfair competition claims.

Class certification—rest breaks and expense reimbursement. The court affirmed the denial of class certification for the rest break claims, noting that the Donohue presumption does not apply to rest breaks because employers are not required to maintain rest break records. The only evidence supporting the rest break claim was Dieves’s own declaration, which did not compel a finding of predominance of common issues. Similarly, the expense reimbursement claim failed for lack of substantial evidence that personal cell phone use was required or that the reimbursement was insufficient, as most drivers reported infrequent work-related phone use and no inadequacy in reimbursement.

The PAGA claim—manageability and preemption. The trial court had struck the PAGA claim as unmanageable, relying on Wesson v. Staples (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 746. The appellate court, however, reversed, citing the Supreme Court of California’s decision in Estrada v. Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc. (2024) 15 Cal.5th 582, which held that trial courts lack inherent authority to strike PAGA claims for manageability. The appellate court rejected the employers’ argument that due process concerns warranted striking the claim, finding no record basis for such a conclusion.

FMCSA preemption of meal and rest break rules. On the issue of federal preemption, the appellate court addressed the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) 2018 decision preempting California’s meal and rest break rules for property-carrying commercial motor vehicle drivers. Distinguishing the decision of the California Court of Appeal in Garcia v. Superior Court (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 63, which concluded the FMCSA’s 2018 preemption decision did not bar meal and rest period claims under California law arising from conduct that occurred prior to the decision (i.e., before December 28, 2018), the court adopted the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ reasoning in Valiente v. Swift Transportation Co. of Arizona, LLC, 54 F.4th 581 (9th Cir. 2022), holding that preemption applied regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred. Nevertheless, the court remanded the issue for the trial court to determine whether the plaintiff’s PAGA claim was preempted, as preemption applies only to drivers subject to federal hours-of-service rules.

Key Takeaways

There are several key points to consider from the Court of Appeal’s recent decision:

Courts must apply the Donohue burden-shifting framework when time records indicate missed meal breaks and no premium pay, shifting the burden to employers to show individualized issues.

The Donohue presumption does not extend to rest break claims, as employers are not required to maintain rest break records.

Manageability is not a valid basis for striking PAGA claims; trial courts must use case-management techniques to address complexity without abridging due process. It should be noted, however, that this case involved a version of PAGA in effect prior to the PAGA reforms enacted in July 2024. Under those PAGA reforms, a trial court may limit the scope of a PAGA claim to make the claim manageable at trial. Specifically, courts may limit the evidence the parties may present at trial, limit the scope of a PAGA claim such that the claim can be manageably tried, or consolidate or coordinate actions that allege legally or factually overlapping violations against the same employer.

Federal preemption under the Motor Carrier Safety Act bars enforcement of California’s meal and rest break rules for covered drivers, regardless of when the alleged violations occurred, but factual determinations regarding coverage must be made by the trial court.

The appellate court’s decision underscores the importance of accurate timekeeping, proper application of legal presumptions, and careful consideration of federal regulatory developments in defending against wage and hour claims. Employers in the transportation industry may want to review their wage and hour policies, recordkeeping practices, and litigation strategies in light of evolving standards for class certification, PAGA enforcement, and federal preemption.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-12/Labor%20and%20Employment%20Law%20USA-467647909%204.26.31%E2%80%AFPM.jpg.webp?itok=OU-wUtA2,N,,2025-12-18 04:57:17.889940

Since Donald Trump took office in January, Pastor Dianne Garcia says 12 members of her church, Iglesia Cristiana Roca de Refugio, have been arrested by ICE and seven have been deported.

“ICE has been very active here in San Antonio. We’ve had a number of members of our congregation detained in various circumstances. Right now there are five members of our congregation currently in detention,” Garcia told Border Report. “In the last three weeks, we’ve had two single mothers detained with their children, one with her 3-year-old toddler and one with her three younger children.”

Garcia says the arrests started six weeks ago. And all were arrested when they went for their mandatory ICE check-in meetings.

“The majority have been arrested when they’ve gone to the ICE office to present themselves for their regularly scheduled check-in,” Garcia says.

The meetings occur about every six months and are a requirement of migrants seeking asylum and who are in immigration proceedings to ensure U.S. officials know of their whereabouts.

“Unfortunately, they’re targeting those people who are trying to follow the law and do the right thing and present themselves, and they’re the ones that are mostly being detained. Almost all of the members of my community have been detained there,” Garcia says.

Border Report asked Department of Homeland Security officials if ICE agents are making arrests at check-in meetings. A DHS spokesperson responded: “Apprehensions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offices may occur if individuals are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States. These actions are typically carried out by law enforcement partners, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”

Iglesia Cristiana Roca de Refugio church was founded in April 2023 specifically to help immigrants living in the south side of San Antonio. All of their services are held in Spanish.

“We actually started the church before all of this happened years ago with the idea to be a place of home and belonging for people who were far from their home and are often told they don’t belong here,” said Garcia, 46, is a second-generation immigrant.

She says it’s hard to advise congregants on doing what is right when she feels the government is doing wrong.

“It’s really hard to talk to people about having hope when it feels so hopeless and it feels like you could do everything right and still be treated terribly and be detained and separated from your family or deported. It’s really hard to talk to people about the fact that anyone could be detained at any time, and it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a criminal background, that actually what they’re saying is not what they’re doing, that they are targeting anyone they can, I assume, just to have their numbers at a certain level,” Garcia said.

The Trump administration says it wants to remove all immigrants with criminal backgrounds from the United States.

But the latest data shows that nearly three quarters of those currently detained, as of Nov. 30, have no criminal convictions, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of Syracuse University.

Garcia says one of the single mothers recently arrested is from Venezuela and in her mid 30s and was a cook in a local restaurant. “She had a work permit and driver’s license and she’s also just a model person. She’s an incredible member of our community and completely beloved by everybody.”

Garcia is not releasing the names of those arrested for fear of retribution against their families.

The women and others who have been arrested are being held at the Karnes County Immigration Processing southeast of San Antonio, and the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, in Dilley, Texas.

She says the facilities are crowded with mothers and children waiting in line for medical care, toiletries, food and even to get their children into daily classes.

She says she has visited congregants at both facilities, including last week.

She says her community is tight-knit, and families affiliated with her members are scared to leave their homes and most know someone who has been arrested and detained by ICE.

“I know of maybe 40 people in detention and 40 families who are trying to work through what they’re going to do now that that member of their family has been detained,” Garcia said. “They really want to be here and want to be a part of our community and they really want to help us build a stronger community and a better world.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/IMG_1841-1-e1766015328201.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-17 21:59:10.385566

Between July 29 and Oct. 15, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 950 people in Washington. The pace of arrests during those two-and-a-half months far surpasses increases earlier in the year. From Inauguration Day in January to the end of July, arrests totaled just over 1,000.

And as detainments have increased, the share of those with criminal records has dropped. This despite federal authorities claiming that they’re targeting immigrants with violent criminal histories.

Just over 31% of those arrested in Washington between the end of July and mid-October had criminal convictions. Roughly another 17% had pending criminal charges. That’s compared to about 40% and 18%, respectively, in the rest of the year.

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, this month cited the case of a Clark County man who was mauled by a dog during his arrest by ICE as an example of how federal immigration authorities are “terrorizing everyone,” whether they have a criminal record or not.

“This should shock the conscience of every one of us,” she said in a statement. “I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.”

But even having a criminal history still doesn’t justify allegedly abusing people’s rights, said Vanessa Torres Hernandez, the integrated policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter.

President Donald Trump’s campaign has more than doubled deportation arrests compared to last year under President Joe Biden. Nearly 2,000 people in Washington have been arrested since Trump retook office, compared to about 800 over the same period last year. In September alone, federal immigration authorities arrested over 350 in Washington.

Brenda Rodriguez López, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said the data “affirms what our communities have experienced for months.”

“This represents nearly 2,000 families who have had a loved one taken away from them; 2,000 communities who have suddenly lost a neighbor, a coworker, a friend; 2,000 people who have had to face brutal conditions while in detention and the possibility of permanent separation due to deportation,” she said in a statement.

The spike in arrests in Washington mirrors national trends. The Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts in major American cities, but has yet to specifically target Seattle, despite officials frequently mentioning Washington’s biggest city as on their radar.

The arrest figures come from the Deportation Data Project out of the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers received the information via Freedom of Information Act requests.

It provides a rare statistical look into the Trump administration’s deportation program here and across the nation.

But it’s not comprehensive. For one, it only includes ICE administrative arrests, excluding Customs and Border Protection. And, in some cases, no state is listed for individual arrest records. So the arrest figures for Washington are likely an undercount. They also don’t account for the rest of October and November.

While previous datasets have included more complete information on each arrestee’s country of origin, the latest stats are lacking on that front.

The jump in enforcement followed Congress earmarking $170 billion to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda in the Republican-backed “big, beautiful bill” in July. Federal officials are now using some of the money to buy a half-dozen Boeing planes for deportation flights, instead of relying on chartered jets, according to The Washington Post.

Local advocacy group La Resistencia has seen the increase in arrests as it monitors deportation flights in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle, to either be deported, transferred or held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. This month, the organization is seeing three or four flights per week, compared to one a week last year, said Josefina Mora-Cheung, organizing director.

“The movement of people and the targeting of people is at an unprecedented level that La Resistencia has not seen since we were founded 11 years ago,” Mora-Cheung said.

The increased arrests have stirred worries of overcrowding at the Tacoma detention center. As of Nov. 28, the 1,575-bed facility was holding just over 1,300 people, according to Detention Reports.

In a letter Tuesday, many of the Democrats in Washington’s congressional delegation urged the acting ICE director to release those held at the detention center who don’t pose a public safety threat due to concerns over deteriorating conditions from crowding there.

The state fought for years in court with the facility’s operator, The GEO Group, to inspect it. Despite a recent appeals court ruling in the state’s favor, inspectors still haven’t been able to get in, according to the state Department of Health.

The detention center has a history of allegations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect of detainees.

But, Atkinson continued, “with the money from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ we expect that is something that could happen here in the future, and we want to be prepared.”

That tone of hope — and pragmatism — carried through a panel of speakers, who spoke to a crowd of several hundred people packing the theater at Gray Area in the Mission.

The panel — composed of Atkinson, assistant chief at the public defender’s office Angela Chan, Shira Levine, a former immigration judge fired by the Trump administration, Marissa Hatton, a senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, and a Peruvian asylum seeker who was detained by ICE — reflected on the past year of immigration crackdown and resistance in San Francisco.

The bilingual panel was moderated by Mission Local immigration reporters Margaret Kadifa and Sage Ríos Mace. Eleven community organizations — legal services, advocacy groups, translation services — set up tables with resource flyers and volunteer forms. Some decorated their table with handmade monarch butterflies, a symbol of migration.

Here are the highlights of what the panelists had to say:

San Francisco’s resistance to ICE is built on years of organizing

Over the past 10 months, San Francisco has witnessed courthouse arrests, protests, and a federal deployment that was called off at the last minute.

But the city’s resistance to treating immigration as a criminal matter began decades before that, said Chan from the public defender’s office. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989 — meaning that city employees, like police officers, are forbidden from helping federal agents with immigration-related matters.

Making sure that sanctuary legislation actually works, said Chan, has been a long process as well. The legislation has been updated several times, and it’s taken plenty of work along the way to make sure that police are actually following the ordinance.

It took further work to establish California as a sanctuary state, Chan continued, and to help pass protections in other Bay Area counties as well. Today, many of those counties have stronger sanctuary protections than San Francisco does.

When the city braced for a “surge” of federal agents in October, it directed an additional $3.5 million to immigration services. But in the coming year, the city needs to cut its budget by $400 million — it is unclear if pushing back against deportations will be a priority for the mayor going forward.

Immigration attorneys and advocates have also built a response network that spans from legal and translation services to court observer shifts to “adopt a laborer corner” neighborhood watch.

From courthouse arrests to more private places

Attorneys have seen more aggressive enforcement in the Bay Area in cities outside of San Francisco, like Santa Clara, Alameda and Sacramento. There, federal agents conduct larger-scale operations at Home Depot parking lots or day laborer meeting locations.

In San Francisco, arrests at immigration courts have been rare in recent months, but there has been “a huge increase” of arrests at check-ins at ICE’s field office at 630 Sansome St., said Atkinson.

Arrests are now moving to more private spheres, Atkinson said: routine check-ins, marriage green card interviews and asylum interviews outside of court.

Such tactics have already been seen in San Francisco and elsewhere in California. Immigrants were arrested and sent to detention centers out of state after regular in-person ICE check-ins. In San Diego County, federal agents have started to arrest foreign spouses of U.S. citizens at green card interviews since mid November.

These arrests, unlike those at court, are harder to track publicly. At 630 Sansome St., Atkinson said, federal agents target 10 to 20 individuals every day and detain them — many came from outside of San Francisco.

Antonella, a social worker, moved to the United States from South America two years ago. She was one of the asylum-seekers arrested at court by ICE agents in July.

At the time, Antonella told the audience in Spanish, she was terrified. The ICE officers arresting her only spoke English, and forcibly separated her from the interpreter who had been helping her in court.

“They chained me at my wrist, at my feet and on my waist. And they were patting us down constantly,” she said. The agents kept pressuring her to sign a document that was in English. (Ariel Koren, executive director of Respond Crisis Translation, a nonprofit that provides emergency translation services, interpreted for Antonella at the Tuesday panel.)

Antonella was ordered into the back of a van crowded with other detainees, and the group was driven for six hours to a detention center in Mesa Verde near Bakersfield. “We could barely breathe. There was no air in there,” she said. “I was so desperate that I was banging, asking for help. But I was ignored.”

Back in San Francisco, a team of immigration attorneys frantically filed a habeas corpus petition — a novel maneuver that uses federal district court to pull a person out of detention at immigration court, on the grounds that a courthouse arrest in immigration court (which is a civil court, not a criminal one) violates due process and that the person must be released.

“They filed for her, not knowing what the outcome would be,” said Atkinson. The habeas petition worked. “And then her case helped us build up for the next case and the next case after that.”

By September, Atkinson said, “every single person” who was arrested at court would immediately have a habeas petition filed. “Some of them, we were able to get out before they even left San Francisco,” she said.

Atkinson, Levine, the former immigration judge and other organizations are developing a Bay Area Habeas network. Its goal — “a really ostentatious goal” — is to file a habeas petition within a couple of hours for people arrested at ICE check-ins.

“It’s a project!” Levine exclaimed, as the crowd applauded. “But we are already seeing results on the ground.”

The class-action lawsuits going up against ICE

Antonella was one of many asylum seekers who experienced “terrible” conditions at ICE’s 630 Sansome St. facility. At the panel, she described only given beans and water; attorneys say their clients were held for days without a tooth brush, shower or medication.

When detainees asked for medical help, ICE ignored them unless the requests were in English, said panelist Marissa Hatton, senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco. “What we were finding is that ICE was arresting people at such high rates that they just didn’t know what to do with them and didn’t have the capacity to hold them.”

Hatton is one of the lead attorneys on Pablo Sequen v. Albarran, a lawsuit challenging ICE’s practices of arresting people at immigration courts and holding them for extended periods in inhumane conditions.

The Pablo Sequen legal team won a preliminary injunction in November, requiring ICE to improve the conditions at the holding facility at 630 Sansome St. in downtown San Francisco. ICE is ordered to provide beds, bedding and medical care from professionals and language access to people in its custody.

Another motion in the lawsuit is challenging ICE’s courthouse arrest tactic, arguing that ICE can’t arrest people at courthouses because of the chilling effect of deterring people from showing up in court. Hatton said she anticipated the judge to rule in favor of this motion.

“Once we get that ruling, what we’ll do next is not just to invalidate the practice here in San Francisco, but to declare the ICE policy invalid for the entire nation,” Hatton said.

What comes next

San Francisco’s immigration court has the largest backlog of any immigration court in California, so high that final hearings are being scheduled for as far out as 2029. But it has fewer and fewer judges — the Trump administration has fired 12 judges in San Francisco since April, and two judges are retiring by the end of the year, leaving only seven to hear more than 120,000 cases.

In recent weeks, Department of Homeland Security lawyers have been proposing to close asylum cases in the United States and instead reroute those asylum-seekers into other countries like Honduras, Ecuador or Guatemala.

Attorneys are figuring out how to respond, said Atkinson. The remaining judges seemed to be under pressure to approve the government’s motion, and have signaled to the attorneys that they should appeal these decisions.

In the meantime, however, asylum seekers are at risk of detention, which means, Atkinson continued, that some will either go undercover or leave the country entirely, because they are so afraid of being detained.

It is part of the administration’s plan to “get rid of the cases as soon as possible, in whatever way you can,” added Levine. “What we’re really seeing is just a desire to slice through the cases. I think that’s really scary.”

Levine told the audience that, about two weeks before her September firing, she and her fellow judges had received a memo stating that immigration judges who granted asylum at higher rates than the average must be “biased.” Now an incoming deputy legal director at the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area, she is outspoken about the administration.

“What’s happening here is clearly not about improvements or making things fairer or even making things more efficient,” she said. “What we’re seeing is a dismantling that is attempting to undermine the ability of anyone to have a hearing, to have due process, to see a judge.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 19:57:35.419268

His detention reflects a broader shift in federal enforcement priorities emphasizing mandatory detention over alternatives for supervision.
Momand’s case, and others throughout the country, have demonstrated how much the Trump administration has expanded the nation’s deportation infrastructure.
Ultimately, contemporary U.S. immigration proceedings are increasingly defined by vastly expanded legal discretion and a widening net for non-citizens.
Virginia’s substantial population of Afghan nationals are among many local immigrant groups seeing their futures blurred as a result.","Amid a national immigration crackdown, the fallout from the recent shooting of two National Guardsmen by an Afghan national in Washington, D.C., has thrust the precarious status of Afghan nationals in the U.S. into the spotlight.

In Richmond, Axios reported earlier this week that local Afghan families have seen citizenship oath ceremonies and visa appointments canceled in the wake of the shooting.

According to the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), nearly 200,000 Afghans were relocated to the U.S. as SIV holders, refugees, and asylees between August 2021 and the start of the second Trump term. As reported by the Associated Press, Virginia has resettled more Afghan refugees per capita than any other state.

Back in August, escalating enforcement had already reached Henrico, where 19-year-old Arman Momand, a legal resident from Afghanistan, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and held at the Farmville Detention Center before being released.

Henrico’s Momand is now a green card holder, but he was nearly deported over misdemeanor charges.

He arrived in the U.S. with his family in 2021 and held Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) status at the time of his arrest, a designation for individuals who face retaliation for assisting the U.S. military abroad. Despite receiving no court-issued jail time, Momand was detained by ICE, held for two months at the Farmville Detention Center, and placed into expedited removal proceedings, a process that would have required his return to Afghanistan.

His detention reflects a broader shift in federal enforcement priorities emphasizing mandatory detention over alternatives for supervision. In Virginia, non-citizen arrest rates have tripled within the first seven months of 2025 compared to the last full year, according to available data.

Despite his legal status, “he’d already been detained, and ICE has a lot of discretion in terms of when they let someone go if they have ongoing proceedings,” Momand’s lawyer, Alejandra DeJesus Pinto, said.

While Momand was held in custody, his family continued the process of applying for permanent residency. He ultimately completed his green card interview by video from inside the detention center. The interview was successful, and Momand was granted his green card while still in ICE custody.

After two months, he was released.

Momand’s case, and others throughout the country, have demonstrated how much the Trump administration has expanded the nation’s deportation infrastructure. The second Trump term now includes an increasing number of cases in which the government has moved to deport immigrants with green cards and visas, from high-profile cases like Mahmoud Khalil’s to the review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, including individuals with green cards.

While the countries affected by the administration’s response to the D.C. shooting were not specified, Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on social media that he has “directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern,” and a USCIS announcement named Afghanistan among 19 “high-risk” countries.

“The president can restrict or suspend entry of immigrants from certain countries or processing of asylums, but his power to do so is limited and subject to court review,” DeJesus Pinto said. “We will have to wait and see how this plays out on a large scale, how far this administration chooses to pursue this, as well as how far the courts are willing to allow them to pursue it.”

The suspected D.C. shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who underwent vetting by counterterrorism authorities before entering the U.S., the Washington Post reported. He first entered the U.S. in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that helped resettle Afghan nationals following the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in December 2024, which was granted in April 2025.

“[The Trump administration] is looking to remove more people, more quickly, with less process,” said Amanda Frost, a professor of law and director of the Immigration, Migration and Human Rights Program at the University of Virginia School of Law. “They’ve made every effort to do that, the Alien Enemies Act being one major example; the attempts to revoke student visas; encouraging people to self-deport; using terrorism as a way to take away student visas.”

“It’s clear that the Trump administration is exploiting this horrible tragedy to further its anti-immigrant agenda, as evidenced by the many policies they have enacted and proposed targeting immigrants and refugees, including Afghans,” said Kimberly Grano, a litigation staff attorney with IRAP. “Blanket efforts to deny or take away immigration benefits, including from individuals already in the U.S., on the basis of nationality, raise serious legal questions.”

In May, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans in the U.S., with the White House stating that they no longer faced a threat in their home country. That same month, the administration welcomed the first group of white South African, or Afrikaner, refugees under an executive order mandating the prioritization of their resettlement, claiming the group faces racial discrimination in South Africa.

The ICE website features a public catalog of recent arrests emphasizing the agency’s focus on the “Worst of the Worst.” On the ground, however, those with minor charges or no charges at all, something multiple federal judges have found unlawful, appear to be increasingly targeted.

Estimates by The Marshall Project found that more than 1,800 people with traffic violations were deported between January and August 2025, and that people with no criminal convictions made up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 deportations between January and May 2025.

Ultimately, contemporary U.S. immigration proceedings are increasingly defined by vastly expanded legal discretion and a widening net for non-citizens. Virginia’s substantial population of Afghan nationals are among many local immigrant groups seeing their futures blurred as a result.

Cantwell, lawmakers: “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC… Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”; KUOW: Inside the black box of ICE detention in Tacoma, she watched her wedding day come and go

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and senior member of the Finance Committee, joined Members of the Washington state Congressional delegation in a letter to Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons, expressing grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington, and demanding answers to a long list of questions regarding overcrowding and lack access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for individuals detained at the facility. The population at NWIPC has ballooned over the past year under the Trump administration’s indiscriminate and cruel mass deportation campaign, nearing—and at times exceeding—the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575.

Joining Senator Cantwell in sending the letter to ICE were: Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Rick Larsen (D, WA-02), Emily Randall (D, WA-06), Pramila Jayapal (D, WA-07), Kim Schrier (D, WA-08), Adam Smith (D, WA-09), and Marilyn Strickland (D, WA-10).

“Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility,” the Members wrote in their letter. “In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity. None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.”

“It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities,” the lawmakers continued. “With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.”

In the letter, the Members raise concern over the lack of medical care for individuals detained at NWIPC and other ICE facilities, writing: “We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens. Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care.”

The lawmakers’ letter also draws attention to reports from advocates that at least three pregnant women detained at NWIPC over the past year have been unable to receive appropriate medical care. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

The Members continued by raising concerns over the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC and difficulty that detained individuals have in accessing legal counsel, writing: “Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The letter concludes by requesting answers to a list of questions by January 16th regarding capacity and staffing levels at NWIPC, the provision of food and medical care, access to legal counsel, treatment of pregnant women, and recent facility visits. “Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility,” the Members wrote. “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect. Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”

Senator Cantwell and other members of Washington state’s Congressional delegation have been conducting oversight of NWIPC throughout this year, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to block congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. After a protracted legal battle over Washington state’s ability to enforce health and safety standards at NWIPC, a federal appeals court ruled in August that the state should be allowed to enforce such standards at the detention center, and that failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation.

In September, Senator Cantwell also joined 13 of her colleagues in sending a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem expressing grave concerns about ICE’s detention practices with respect to detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women and demanding more information about how ICE officers are ensuring that these women are receiving sufficient medical care while in custody.

The lawmakers’ full letter to ICE is available HERE and below:

Dear Acting Director Lyons:?

We are writing to share our grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and to request information about access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for detained noncitizens at the facility.?Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility. In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity.

None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.

You must ensure the facility complies with the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards as revised in 2016 (PBNDS 2011) to keep detained noncitizens safe and healthy while protecting the rights they are entitled to under law.

It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities. With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.

Medical Care

The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to protect the health of individuals in its custody. We have had long-standing concerns about access to medical services in ICE detention facilities. In recent years, several members of the Washington Congressional delegation requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody. At times this year, NWIPC has exceeded 1,500 individuals in custody, nearing the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575 individuals. We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens.

Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care. During an August 2025 site visit, facility staff indicated the facility employed only four behavioral health staffers. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. It is plainly inadequate to have four behavioral health staff serving the 1,500 detainees under the facility’s care, especially given the fact that serious behavioral health issues frequently emerge under the severe stress of detention. We are also alarmed by reports from advocates with access to the facility that at least three detained pregnant women at NWIPC have been unable to receive appropriate medical care, even after they request specialty prenatal care appointments. Regular exams such as ultrasounds are necessary to monitor development and ensure a healthy pregnancy. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

Food

The Seattle Times recently reported on the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC as the detained population has increased. Advocates who speak with detainees have shared that meals are provided late and, in some cases, detainees did not receive three meals per day. Detainees have made complaints about food and sanitation for many years, and we urge the facility to be responsive to the nutritional needs of individuals in its custody. Legal service providers with access to the facility have also shared that detainees waiting for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings may miss meals. We urge the facility to ensure that all detained noncitizens, including those awaiting hearings or visits, are provided a minimum of three meals per day, as required by national detention standards (PBNDS 2011).

Access to Legal Counsel

Access to legal resources for noncitizens in immigration detention supports their ability to understand their rights and navigate immigration court, preventing backlogs in the immigration court system. Detained noncitizens at NWIPC face several concerning barriers to accessing legal counsel. Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients. This August, two of the seven attorney visitation rooms were being used as Virtual Attorney Visitation rooms (VAVs) and two were being used for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings, leaving only three rooms available for attorneys to meet with their clients in person. We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms.?

In the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress provided $10,000,000 for ICE to improve legal resources for noncitizen detainees, including to expand video attorney visitation. During an August 2025 site visit, NWIPC staff indicated that the facility recently implemented a new scheduling system to reserve attorney visitation rooms. We ask that the facility work with attorneys to resolve any issues that arise with the new system expeditiously so as not to delay access to legal counsel. We urge you to improve access to legal counsel by ensuring attorney visitation rooms remain available for attorneys to meet with their clients.

Given these concerns, we request answers to the following questions by January 16, 2026:

What is the maximum capacity of NWIPC, as determined by the fire marshal? As of November 1, 2025, how many individuals were detained at the facility??

How many staff were employed by NWIPC on January 20, 2025??Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provided direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many staff were employed by NWIPC? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provide direct medical services??

As of November 1, 2025, how many pregnant women were detained at NWIPC? How often have these women requested, and how often have they received, prenatal care appointments with a specialist?

How many days in the last six months has the facility not provided three meals each day to every noncitizen in its custody?

Why did the facility not provide three meals each day to every noncitizen?

For each day, for how many noncitizens were three meals not provided?

What is the current status of the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at NWIPC? Are noncitizens able to access LOP daily? What are the hours of availability each day? Outside of hours, are there any other restrictions on daily LOP access, and if so, what are they and why are they in place?

How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for in-person attorney meetings? How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for virtual attorney meetings?

In the last six months, have the attorney visitation rooms been used for a purpose other than attorney-client meetings (in-person or virtual) or video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings?

When were the most recent facility visits by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General, DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and ICE oversight personnel (whether the Office of Professional Responsibility or otherwise)? What, if any, recommendations were made after each visit? What progress has been made to implement such recommendations?

OIDO issued a report in November 2024 following an inspection of NWIPC. While 11 of the recommendations have been addressed, one remains outstanding. What progress has been made on implementing the remaining recommendation? ?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility.

We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.

Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.

The Trump administration’s ramped up federal immigration enforcement is putting those questions “front and center” she said.","Federal immigration agents are violating Minnesotans’ constitutional rights in the course of their large-scale enforcement action in the Twin Cities, according to allegations in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota (ACLU) is leading a suit accusing Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of violating the First and Fourth Amendment rights of Minnesotans by harassing people documenting enforcement activity and by detaining U.S. citizens.

The six plaintiffs include Abdikadir Noor, a Somali American who experienced racist rhetoric when he was detained by ICE for more than four hours on Monday and Susan Tincher, a north Minneapolis resident who was detained and had her wedding ring cut off by ICE agents after observing an arrest in her neighborhood.

“Our ultimate goal is to protect what Minnesotans want to do when they disagree with their government,” said Alicia Granse, a staff attorney with the ACLU.

The ACLU filed the suit in coordination with lawyers from Ciresi Conlin, Forsgren Fisher and Riach Law. The suit is the first major legal challenge to ICE action in Minnesota, which has exploded this month under what the agency calls Operation Metro Surge.

“Since the launch of Operation Metro Surge, we have witnessed a remarkable string of unlawful activity targeting the Minnesota community and Minnesota values,” ACLU Executive Director Deepinder Mayell said.

Some plaintiffs in the lawsuit were intimidated by ICE agents, according to the lawsuit. One, Alan Crenshaw, was sprayed with chemical irritants while protesting ICE activity in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis. ICE agents in Richfield allegedly pointed guns at married couple Janet Lee and John Biestman and told them: “We have your license plate. We know where to find you.”

The lawsuit is attempting to create a protected class of people who observe, document and protest federal immigration actions in Minnesota, Granse said. As part of the suit, the ACLU intends to seek a temporary restraining order to give Minnesotans additional legal protections while the case moves through the court.

Somali American arrested, experienced racism at hands of ICE

Noor, a 45-year-old Fridley resident who has been a U.S. citizen for 20 years, was going to get coffee at Karmel Mall in Minneapolis on Monday when he was pulled over by ICE, according to the lawsuit. His arrest was part of a high profile ICE action near Pillsbury Avenue that was featured in several news articles.

Another car with Latino occupants was stopped at the same time as Noor, according to the lawsuit. When Noor realized it was ICE and not the police, he told agents that he knew his rights and wouldn’t show them anything. The agents then targeted the vehicle with Latino occupants. Noor also encouraged people in that vehicle to assert their rights.

A crowd formed and the situation became tense. Agents began scuffling with a woman who crowd members said was pregnant, throwing her to the ground, according to the suit. Noor was trying to calm the crowd when he was suddenly thrown to the ground and arrested, according to the lawsuit.

With Noor in custody, an ICE agent sped down the highway to the federal Whipple Building near Fort Snelling, not allowing Noor to buckle his seatbelt, according to the lawsuit. As he was processed by ICE, the agent examining his passport told another officer, “They all come here fraudulently. Fifty percent are here fraudulently,” according to the lawsuit. The agent allegedly said that “Somalis should go back home.”

Noor was shackled and placed in a room alone for about four hours, according to the lawsuit, before eventually being read his rights. He was released without any charges or paperwork at about 6 p.m.

“The whole time I was there at the scene, I just wanted to tell the government that what they were doing to the woman, to the Latinos, to all of us, is wrong,” Noor said in a statement included in the lawsuit. “I just wanted to tell people what their rights are in this country and under our Constitution.”

ICE actions causing chaos, difficult to track

Noor is one of several Somali Americans to be detained by ICE during Operation Metro Surge.

Last Tuesday, Mubashir, a 20-year-old Somali Minneapolis resident, was arrested by federal officers in Cedar-Riverside despite repeatedly telling officers of his U.S. citizenship. He offered to show them his I.D. on his phone, but they ignored him.

Several immigrant advocacy groups and elected officials say federal officers are racial profiling people to stop and detain them. Federal officers were seen driving around immigrant-dense neighborhoods, like Cedar-Riverside and near E. Lake Street, stopping to question people on public streets about their immigration status, Miguel Hernandez, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, said in an interview last week.

Federal officers confronting immigrants to question and arrest them is a major shift from past large-scale enforcement actions that drew crowds of protesters, he said, such as the ICE raid at Bro-Tex in St. Paul.

“I think they figured out this community is going to stand up and resist and that larger operations are not effective because they get bogged down by the community asking for accountability,” he said. “These smaller snatch-and-grab units can just disperse to grab and go quickly.”

Since the beginning of Operation Metro Surge, Hernandez said it’s been difficult to track ICE arrests.

“It’d be like trying to count water,” he told the Sahan Journal. “You can measure it in volume, but it gets everywhere.”

More legal challenges could come

In September, the Supreme Court issued an emergency action to temporarily allow officers to make arrests based on race, language and occupation. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a Tuesday morning news conference that he is working with legal partners and intends to file legal action on federal enforcement action. He did not specify when he’ll file, he added.

Other states, such as California and Chicago — the locations of ICE operations that occurred in recent months — have pending lawsuits against the Trump administration challenging the use of racial profiling on immigration-related arrests.

“This seems to be very much about content, fear and a disregard of the rule of law as opposed to law and order,” said Simon Trautman Cordova, an associate attorney for the Minnesota Justice Coalition.

In Mubashir’s case, he told officers multiple times that he had proof of U.S. citizenship and without evidence disproving that, continuing to detain and fingerprinting him violates his Fourth Amendment right, Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, an attorney for the ACLU, told Sahan Journal.

She also said a person detained by federal immigration officers without a warrant has the right to remain silent or verbally tell officers about their rights. They can also ask to leave or call an attorney, but it’s not guaranteed officers will grant it.

For decades, holding officers accountable for violating a person’s constitutional rights during an immigration-related arrest or questioning is “really hard,” said Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of the Advocates for Human Rights, a nonprofit legal organization.

“In the immigration context, those checks and balances are really missing,” she said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference hosted by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The Trump administration’s ramped up federal immigration enforcement is putting those questions “front and center” she said.

In addition to targeting neighborhoods and immigrant-owned businesses during Operation Metro Surge, federal agents have waited outside homes to arrest immigrants, according to immigrant advocacy groups. In public spaces, like on the street, federal officers have the authority to question or detain someone they suspect to be violating immigration law, immigration attorneys say.

“It’s crucial to continue to shed light on the unlawful conduct by ICE agents and the brutality and cruelty in which they are pursuing Minnesotans regardless of their immigration status,” Ahlin-Halverson said.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-17_ACLU-Press-Conference-13.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 19:01:30.275644

“The crisis we’re having has a lot of similarities to the crisis that was happening over 250 years ago,” Katy Dirks, a member of Boston Indivisible’s leadership council, said in an interview. “Families are afraid to go out of their homes. We’re outraged right now, and we’re standing up for our neighbors.”

Holding “No Kings” and anti-ICE signs, the group marched along Milk and Congress streets before reaching Waterfront Plaza. Protesters then dumped “clean ice,” per guidance from MassDEP and Boston Conservation Commission, into the harbor next to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum.

The protest also aimed to bring light to the “Trump Administration’s corruption, authoritarianism, and destruction of our democratic norms,” the groups said.

“I think this is one of the most brutal regimes we’ve had in this country, and I want my niece and nephew to remember that it’s important to protest, and that we in Boston are part of a proud tradition of dumping things into the harbor with which we disagree,” Sarah Sievers, of Cambridge, told The Boston Globe at the protest.

ACLU lawyers say the alleged abuses against self-described constitutional observers in Minnesota since the beginning of “Operation Metro Surge” follows a pattern seen in other places that have seen large-scale immigration enforcement operations, such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

“Federal agents’ unlawful, unconstitutional, and distasteful conduct has inspired widespread protests throughout the Twin Cities Metro area, as well as a surge in people observing and documenting ICE activity in their cities and neighborhoods,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants have met this upswell of First Amendment protected conduct and expression with an explosion of constitutional violations.”

The lawsuit names several federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Director Todd Lyons.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has reached out to ICE for their response to the lawsuit but has not heard back.

You can read the full lawsuit below.

One of the plaintiffs, north Minneapolis resident Susan Tincher, made headlines last week when ICE arrested her as she observed an immigration raid the morning of Dec. 9 near the intersection of North 21st and Oliver avenues. She says she was tackled and placed in handcuffs within 15 seconds of arriving on scene and had only asked an agent, “Are you ICE?”

Tincher was taken to the Whipple Federal Building near Fort Snelling, where federal officers allegedly cut her bra off, removed her boots and cut the laces, and cut her wedding ring from her finger. In the lawsuit, Tincher attested that she declined to talk with law enforcement without a lawyer present.

When Tincher was eventually released, federal officers told her she would be charged with obstruction. ICE eventually released a statement claiming Tincher “assaulted a federal agent” and “became violent” before her arrest; however, eight days later, no charges have been filed against her.

Another plaintiff and U.S. citizen, Abdikadir Noor, was arrested by ICE agents on Tuesday as he stood among a crowd of protesters near Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis. Noor witnessed an ICE agent kneeling on the back of a protester who was reportedly pregnant, and Noor joined bystanders in yelling at them to let her go, the lawsuit states.

As the crowd continued to yell at agents to let the woman go, with some throwing snowballs, Noor attested to telling people to calm down and be peaceful. When the agent kneeling on the woman’s back began dragging her on the pavement, Noor and others followed. When the woman eventually escaped, agents allegedly focused in on Noor, threw him to the ground, and arrested him.

The lawsuit states Noor was taken to the Whipple Federal Building, where agents made comments disparaging Somalis, echoing unsupported claims by Noem that “50% are here fraudulently.” Noor says he was released later that day without charges or an explanation for his arrest.

An ICE spokesperson called the clash at 28th Street and Pillsbury Avenue a “dangerous riot.” Accounts from the Minneapolis Police Department and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office — which both sent officers to assist after receiving reports from DHS of “60 to 70 agitators” — do not support those claims.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said its deputies “did not witness any attacks or any agents needing medical attention.” An MPD spokesperson said its officers responded “immediately” and cleared out within 10 minutes after finding “there was no one being assaulted and no life-safety conditions that warranted further involvement.”

Other plaintiffs listed on the ACLU lawsuit reported incidents of ICE agents pepper spraying protesters in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis and boxing in observers’ cars and pointing guns at them when they had followed federal agents’ vehicles.

The judge ruled on Wednesday that it is likely illegal for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.
They also challenged a policy excluding ICE field offices as facilities that members of Congress are entitled to visit without notice.
They also said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week.
“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” Cobb wrote.","WASHINGTON — A federal judge in the nation's capital has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies limiting Congress members' access to immigration detention facilities.

The judge ruled on Wednesday that it is likely illegal for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden, concluded that the seven-day notice requirement likely exceeds the Department of Homeland Security's statutory authority.

“Plaintiffs have an interest in facts about whether facilities are overcrowded or unsanitary, whether the staff is engaging in abuse, or the location of constituents or their family members,” the judge wrote.

Twelve Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington, D.C., in July to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. They also challenged a policy excluding ICE field offices as facilities that members of Congress are entitled to visit without notice. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump's administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

Government attorneys argued that the plaintiffs don't have legal standing to bring their claims. They also said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. The judge rejected those arguments.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” the Washington-based Cobb wrote in her 73-page decision.

A dozen House Democrats sued over the policies in July, complaining of abruptly imposed limits on the access they had long enjoyed. The Department of Homeland Security has attacked congressional Democrats over their complaints, saying the restrictions were meant to maintain order in ICE facilities and protect agents and officials doing their jobs.

The policies were adopted several weeks after a visit by three Democratic members of Congress to Newark’s Delaney Hall immigration facility, which became the scene of a skirmish among lawmakers, aides and ICE officials after the lawmakers intervened to prevent the arrest of Mayor Ras Baraka. One of the Democrats, Rep. LaMonica McIver, was charged in June with assaulting an ICE officer.

The issue of lawmakers’ access to detention facilities flared again in October when, during the prolonged government shutdown, ICE stopped facilitating many congressional visits, citing staff limitations and also insisting that without federal funding, the agency was no longer required to give lawmakers unfettered access. But when President Donald Trump signed a new government funding bill last month, it included the same requirement for congressional access as those adopted in previous annual funding bills.

Justice Department attorneys urged Cobb to limit any relief in the case to the lawmakers who filed the lawsuit, but Cobb declined. She said the “normal remedy” in the D.C. Circuit is to set aside agency policies that are deemed to be unlawful.

Cobb’s ruling is not a final one on the legal issues in the case, but blocks the new policies as the litigation continues.

In an era marked by war, economic hardship, environmental crises, and the universal search for dignity, migration has become one of the defining realities of our time.

Migration in the Quran: A Path of Faith, Dignity, and Renewal

The Holy Qur’an presents a compassionate and profound vision of migration. God describes the Earth as vast and open for those seeking safety and dignity, “Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to migrate therein?” (4:97). This verse not only condemns oppression but also reproaches those who resign themselves to tyranny while safe migration remains possible. In Islam, hijrah is an act of courage, faith, and self-preservation.

The Quran praises the Muhajirun (those who migrated) and the Anṣar (those who sheltered and supported them), “Those who believed and migrated… and those who sheltered and supported them—these are the true believers” (8:74).

The Just King: Al-Najashi and His Noble Hospitality

In the first migration in Islamic history, a group of persecuted Muslims fled Mecca seeking freedom of worship in Abyssinia. The Christian king, al-Najashi, welcomed them with justice and compassion, granting them safety at a time when they faced severe oppression.

Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp) praised and honored al-Najashi, and his moral stance remains a source of pride across religious traditions. His example demonstrates that true hospitality transcends borders, politics, and religious identities, and that societies rooted in compassion and justice grow stronger—not weaker.

Islamic Teachings on Supporting Migrants

Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp) and the Ahl al-Bayt (p) consistently emphasized kindness, justice, and protection for the displaced.

The Prophet (pbuh&hp) said, Whoever hears a man calling out, ‘O Muslims, help me!’ and does not respond to him, is not a Muslim” (al-Ḥurr al-Amili, Wasaʾil al-Shia, vol. 15, p. 141).

In this noble teaching, refugees and displaced individuals are among the clearest examples of the oppressed (al-maẓlumin). Muslims, and especially Islamic governments, are therefore obligated to offer them protection and to use all available means to alleviate their suffering and remove injustice.

Supporting migrants is not a political preference; it is a moral and spiritual duty.

Duties of Host Communities

Host societies bear profound responsibilities toward migrants and refugees. From an Islamic ethical framework, these include:

Providing safety, dignity, and non-discrimination

Offering access to education, work, and pathways to rebuild life

Supporting spiritual, social, and emotional well-being

Recognizing the opportunities migrants bring: creativity, skills, and cultural enrichment

History demonstrates that immigrants have played pivotal roles in advancing science, culture, medicine, technology, and economic development worldwide.

Responsibilities of Migrants

Migrants also bear significant responsibilities rooted in Islamic ethics:

Respecting the laws, values, and social norms of their new home

Contributing positively through work, education, and community life

Upholding honesty, trustworthiness, and respect

Maintaining their faith and moral identity while engaging constructively with society

The Prophet (pbuh&hp) said, “A Muslim is one from whose hand and tongue other Muslims are safe” (Man La Yaḥḍuruhu al-Faqih, vol. 4, p. 362).

The Root Causes of the Migration Crisis in the Islamic World

According to numerous United Nations reports, a significant proportion of today’s migrants and displaced persons are Muslims from countries suffering from injustice, corruption, tyranny, and political instability.

As long as these deep crises remain unresolved, migration will continue, and likely intensify.

This crisis cannot be resolved by deporting migrants, imposing restrictions, or pressuring them to settle in third countries. Such policies contradict the teachings of Islam and Christianity, and history has repeatedly shown their failure.

Lasting solutions require:

Eliminating injustice,

Reforming unaccountable governments,

Ending corruption,

Restoring human dignity, and

Addressing the underlying social and political causes of displacement.

A Closing Reminder

On this International Migrants Day, we reaffirm that the dignity of every human being, regardless of nationality, race, or immigration status, is sacred.

Islam teaches that helping the vulnerable, welcoming the stranger, and offering refuge to the oppressed are acts of worship and manifestations of justice.

The migration crisis will not be resolved through exclusion or closed borders, but through just governance, moral responsibility, and addressing the root causes of oppression. Anti-migrant policies are neither humane nor sustainable nor aligned with prophetic ethics. As the Muhammadan example and the noble conduct of al-Najashi remind us: A society grounded in compassion will flourish, and migrants who embody integrity and responsibility will become sources of blessing.

We pray that God grants dignity to all migrants, strength to their families, justice to the oppressed, and compassion and wisdom to the communities that receive them.",https://imam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vecteezy_international-migrants-day-design-templets_74278984.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:01:05.546635

These countries are subject to restrictions that typically suspend immigrant visas and select nonimmigrant categories (such as B, F, M, and J), but do not constitute a full entry ban:

Angola (newly added)

Antigua and Barbuda (newly added)

Benin (newly added)

Côte d’Ivoire (newly added)

Dominica (newly added)

Gabon (newly added)

Gambia (newly added)

Malawi (newly added)

Mauritania (newly added)

Nigeria (newly added)

Senegal (newly added)

Tanzania (newly added)

Tonga (newly added)

Zambia (newly added)

Zimbabwe (newly added)

Burundi

Cuba

Togo

Turkmenistan

Venezuela

Notably, Laos and Sierra Leone were previously subject to partial restrictions but have since been elevated to the full travel ban category under the December 2025 expansion and are therefore no longer listed here.

Key considerations:

Restrictions are based on nationality and passport type, not country of residence.

Full bans affect all visa categories; partial bans affect immigrant visas and select nonimmigrant visas.

Waivers and exceptions remain limited and highly case-specific.

Significant travel and visa processing disruptions are likely for affected nationals.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should promptly identify affected employees and dependents, reassess travel and visa-stamping strategies, prepare for increased employee inquiries, disrupted assignments, and compliance planning as the expanded travel ban takes effect.

Gold Card Program: Speed vs. Stability

USCIS has formally launched the Gold Card immigrant visa program with the release of Form I-140G, created under Executive Order 14351, following a soft rollout and new online filing interface. Applicants must first register through trumpcard.gov and receive confirmation before USCIS will invite them to file Form I-140G via a USCIS online account. A separate Platinum Card program has been announced but is not yet available.

The Gold Card requires a minimum $1 million non-refundable contribution and a $15,000 filing fee per person, including the principal applicant and each dependent. Where a corporation or similar entity files on behalf of an individual, the required contribution increases to $2 million for the principal beneficiary plus $1 million per dependent, in addition to filing fees. Visa numbers will be allocated from EB-1 and EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) categories, not EB-5, raising concerns about added pressure on already backlogged visa classifications.

Although public guidance suggests expedited processing, USCIS has provided limited clarity on actual timelines. While the program’s website indicates cases “should take weeks” once fees and applications are received, practitioners caution that processing could take much longer in practice, particularly due to quota constraints, increased scrutiny, and anticipated litigation. All grounds of inadmissibility apply, and heightened review is expected for source of funds and prohibited entity employment. No refunds are available, even if the program is later challenged or rescinded.

Key considerations and open risks:

Program durability: Established by executive order with no statutory or regulatory framework; subject to legal challenge or revocation.

Visa allocation: Gold Card cases draw from EB-1 and EB-2 NIW visa numbers, potentially extending existing backlogs.

Cost structure: $1M non-refundable contribution per individual; $15,000 filing fee per person; higher thresholds for corporate filers.

Family impact: Separate contribution and filing required for each dependent.

Processing uncertainty: Limited clarity on timelines despite promises of expedited adjudication.

Adjustment uncertainty: Form language suggests consular processing only, which may restrict work authorization and travel during adjudication.

Compliance scrutiny: All inadmissibility grounds apply; increased focus on source of funds and restricted entities.

Litigation exposure: Legal challenges anticipated; no refund protection for applicants.

The administration has also announced a forthcoming Trump Platinum Card, requiring a $5 million contribution and a $15,000 processing fee, which would allow eligible applicants to spend up to 270 days per year in the U.S. without U.S. tax on non-U.S. income. Eligibility, filing mechanics, and long-term durability remain unclear.

Impact: For in-house global mobility teams, the Gold Card introduces elevated legal, quota, and employee-advisory risk. Until statutory durability, visa allocation impact, and adjustment mechanics are clarified, the program should be positioned cautiously and evaluated only for narrowly tailored cases, with clear risk disclosure and alternative pathways identified.

States Challenge $100,000 H-1B Fee Proclamation

On December 12, 2025, 20 U.S. states filed a federal lawsuit challenging the September 19 Presidential Proclamation and related agency policies that impose a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B petitions. The case, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, is the third legal challenge to the proclamation and fee structure.

The challenged policy bars approval of H-1B petitions filed after September 20, 2025 that are filed for, or only approvable through, consular notification, unless the employer pays the $100,000 fee, obtains a national interest exception, or the employee is otherwise exempt. The plaintiff states argue that the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act due to lack of notice-and-comment rulemaking, exceeds agency authority by imposing fees unrelated to administrative costs, and is arbitrary and capricious. The lawsuit also raises constitutional separation-of-powers concerns.

The plaintiff states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Defendants include the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Labor, and Justice.

This lawsuit follows two earlier challenges to the same proclamation, including one filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to temporarily block enforcement of the fee. A district court hearing on that injunction is scheduled for December 19, 2025.

Impact: Ongoing court challenges leave the $100,000 H-1B fee in flux, requiring in-house teams to plan conservatively for consular H-1B filings and remain ready to adjust strategy as court decisions emerge.

California’s New “Stay or Pay” Restrictions

Starting January 1, 2026, California’s AB 692 sharply restricts employers from requiring employees or candidates to repay employer-funded costs if they leave or don’t start employment. This includes provisions commonly used in mobility programs, such as repayment of immigration, visa, relocation, training, tuition, and certain sign-on or retention bonuses tied to a service period. The law applies to new contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2026, and allows employees or applicants to bring civil actions, with potential penalties of actual damages or $5,000 per violation, plus attorneys’ fees. While limited exceptions exist, the default in California is now a broad prohibition on “stay or pay” arrangements.

Even outside California, similar repayment provisions are constrained by state wage laws and the FLSA, including minimum wage, overtime, and exempt salary-basis rules, making enforcement risky in many jurisdictions.

Impact: This law shifts away from cost-recovery models, limiting repayment of immigration and relocation expenses for California-based employees and increasing the need for compliant, upfront benefit design and closer coordination with employment counsel.

Holiday Travel Alert: Visa Delays and Revocation Activity

The Alliance of Business Immigration Lawyers (ABIL) is reporting significant winter travel disruptions affecting H-1B and H-4 visa holders, driven by expanded social media and online presence screening and heightened security review. U.S. consulates, particularly in India, have canceled or rescheduled many visa appointments, creating widespread uncertainty for travelers.

Attorneys have confirmed that December 2025 H-1B and H-4 appointments in Hyderabad and Chennai are being pushed into March, April, May 2026, or later, with additional delays expected at other posts. Screening requirements have caused confusion among applicants, and consular officials in India have cited concerns that 70–80% of cases involve fraud, contributing to increased scrutiny and reduced appointment capacity.

Separately, the Department of State has initiated visa revocation actions for some H-1B visa holders based on prior arrest history, including arrests dating back several years. While visa revocation does not automatically terminate lawful U.S. status, it can prevent reentry and significantly increase travel risk.

Key takeaways:

Severe appointment delays: India visa stamping now extending well into mid-2026.

Expanded screening: Social media and online presence checks slowing adjudications.

Heightened scrutiny: Fraud concerns driving stricter review at consular posts.

Revocation risk: Prior arrest history may trigger visa cancellation.

Travel caution: Employees should confirm appointments before departure and avoid non-essential travel.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should treat international travel, especially to India, as high risk this winter and early 2026, reinforce pre-travel approvals, and proactively counsel H-1B and H-4 employees to plan for extended delays or postpone discretionary travel where possible.

USCIS Updates Photo Requirements for Immigration Filings

USCIS issued new guidance on December 12, 2025, effective immediately, limiting the age and type of photographs that may be used for many immigration applications. In most cases, photos used to produce immigration documents may not be more than three years old, though USCIS retains discretion to require a newer photo even when an existing image is available.

For certain filings, USCIS will require a new photograph and new biometrics regardless of when the last photo was taken, including applications to replace permanent resident cards, applications to register permanent residence or adjust status, and applications for naturalization or certificates of citizenship. USCIS also confirmed that self-submitted photos will no longer be accepted; only photos captured by USCIS or other authorized entities may be used.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should expect additional biometrics appointments, longer case timelines, and potential filing delays, and should proactively set employee expectations around new photo and biometrics requirements when planning applications or renewals.

DOS Updates Visa Interview Scheduling Rules

On December 12, 2025, the Department of State (DOS) updated its instructions for all nonimmigrant and immigrant visa applicants scheduling consular interview appointments, reinforcing stricter location requirements tied to nationality and residence.

For nonimmigrant visas, applicants are expected to schedule interviews at a U.S. embassy or consulate in their country of nationality or residence. Nationals of countries where the U.S. is not conducting routine nonimmigrant visa operations must apply at a designated embassy or consulate, unless they are lawfully residing in another country.

For immigrant visas, applicants must generally interview in the consular district designated for their place of residence, or in their country of nationality if requested, with limited exceptions. Applicants residing in countries where routine visa operations are paused must apply at their designated immigrant visa processing post, unless they hold nationality in a country where routine processing continues. DOS has published a list of designated processing posts to guide applicants.

Impact: These changes limit third-country visa processing options and may require earlier, more deliberate travel and appointment planning by in-house teams to avoid scheduling errors and case delays.

DHS Ends TPS Designation for Ethiopia

On December 12, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Ethiopia. Ethiopian nationals who do not have another lawful basis to remain in the United States have 60 days to voluntarily depart the country.

DHS indicated that after February 13, 2026, it may arrest and deport Ethiopian nationals who remain in the U.S. without status following the TPS termination. DHS is encouraging affected individuals to use U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP Home Mobile App to report their departure and self-deport. DHS stated that use of the app may include a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and potential eligibility for future lawful immigration options.

Impact: This change may affect employees or family members relying on TPS, requiring timely outreach, careful counseling on alternative pathways, and thoughtful support as departure or status changes are considered.

DHS Ends Family Reunification Parole Programs

On December 12, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of all categorical Family Reunification Parole (FRP) programs for nationals of Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras, as well as their immediate family members. DHS stated it is returning parole determinations to a case-by-case basis.

Individuals who were paroled into the United States under an FRP program and whose parole has not expired by January 14, 2026, will have their parole terminated on that date unless they have a pending Form I-485 (application to register permanent residence or adjust status) that was filed by December 15, 2025 and remains pending on January 14, 2026. For those with a timely filed and pending I-485, parole will remain valid until either the parole period expires or DHS issues a final decision on the application, whichever occurs first. If the I-485 is denied, parole will terminate immediately and the individual is expected to depart the United States.

DHS also confirmed that termination of parole under the FRP programs will result in revocation of employment authorization tied to that parole. Affected individuals will receive individual notice of parole termination and employment authorization revocation.

Impact: The termination of FRP programs creates immediate compliance considerations, requiring in-house teams to confirm eligibility to remain and work in the U.S. and to prepare for employment authorization revocation where adjustment filings are not in place.

Costa Rica Added to Global Entry Program

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has announced that qualified citizens of Costa Rica are now eligible to apply for the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program, expanding the list of participating partner countries. Approved members receive expedited immigration and customs clearance when entering the United States at participating airports. Costa Rica joins existing Global Entry partner countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and others.

Costa Rican citizens seeking Global Entry must create an account on CBP’s Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP) website, submit an online application, and pay a $120 non-refundable fee. Applicants are subject to background checks and an in-person interview with CBP. Once approved, Global Entry membership is valid for five years, though violations of program rules may result in revocation.

Enrolled Costa Rican Global Entry members may also be eligible for TSA PreCheck, allowing for expedited security screening at participating U.S. airports.

Impact: This update creates an opportunity for eligible Costa Rican employees and business travelers to streamline U.S. entry and airport security processing, potentially reducing travel friction for frequent travelers.

DOL Updates PERM and Prevailing Wage Processing Times

The Department of Labor (DOL) has released updated processing time data for PERM labor certification and prevailing wage determinations (PWDs) as of December 1, 2025, confirming continued backlogs across labor filings. DOL is currently conducting analyst review for PERM applications filed in July 2024 or earlier and audit review for applications filed in November 2024 or earlier, while reconsideration requests submitted in August 2025 or earlier remain under review.

For prevailing wages, DOL is issuing PERM PWDs filed in July 2025 (OEWS-based) and April 2025 (non-OEWS-based), as well as H-1B PWDs filed in July 2025 (OEWS-based) and May 2025 (non-OEWS-based). The agency is also working through PERM and H-1B prevailing wage redeterminations requested in July 2025, along with PERM Center Director Reviews submitted in October 2025. Detailed timelines are available on the DOL FLAG page.

Processing delays may be further exacerbated by operational constraints. Labor filings submitted with the $100,000 fee have reportedly not yet seen adjudications, and a 33-day DOL closure resulted in a buildup of mail-filed cases that are now being manually entered, adding pressure to an already strained system.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:01:54.914305

His family back in China says they were interrogated extensively after Guan left the country and published his Xinjiang footage.","Guan Heng, a native of landlocked north-central China, was so desperate to reach the United States in October 2021 that he decided to buy a small inflatable boat, and set sail from the Bahamas.

He had just published a roughly 20-minute video drawn from footage he had filmed in China's Xinjiang region where people were reportedly being detained.

Guan believed the film would lead to his arrest in China, so he hoped to reach the U.S. and ask for asylum. Battling severe seasickness and despite having no prior boating experience, he reached the shores of Florida 23 hours later, he later told Human Rights in China, a U.S.-based advocacy group, which has been raising awareness about Guan's case.

This week, after months of being held in U.S. immigration detention in upstate New York, the 38-year-old appeared via a video link before an immigration court in upstate New York on his asylum application. His asylum case is still pending.

If asylum is denied, he could face deportation to Uganda, which a Department of Homeland Security lawyer argued in favor of during a Monday hearing on Guan's case. Such third-country deportations, in which people are removed to countries where they are not from, were cleared by the Supreme Court in July. A second hearing for Guan is scheduled for Jan. 12.

The story of Guan's desperate escape to the United States, only to end up in detention, raises fresh questions over the scope of an expanding immigration crackdown in the U.S.

""He has a pending asylum application, and the circumstances of his departure from the PRC are a textbook example of why asylum exists,"" Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote in a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had ""encountered"" Guan while carrying out a criminal search warrant, in a statement sent to NPR. ""This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time. All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.""

In 2020, Guan had become intrigued from English news reports about China's extrajudicial detention of at least hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region, according to his mother and lawyer.

He decided to go to the region and film hours of footage of purported detention camps and evidence of the massive securitization of the region.

He did not dare publish the footage while still in China, so in July 2021, he left China and flew to Ecuador, which Chinese nationals could then enter visa-free, then to the Bahamas, where he bought the small inflatable boat he sailed to the U.S., according to his lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang.

About 15% of asylum applications from Chinese nationals adjudicated in 2024 were rejected, compared to more than 50% that were granted.

In the U.S., Guan applied for asylum and secured a work permit. He made ends meet driving Uber and doing odd jobs.

But this past August, Guan was arrested by ICE who raided his residence initially to investigate his roommate, his lawyer said.

""How Guan ended up being caught by ICE was really due to bad luck,"" said Chen, his lawyer.

His case has attracted criticism from human rights activists, who argue the U.S. must protect Guan as a whistleblower.

His family back in China says they were interrogated extensively after Guan left the country and published his Xinjiang footage.

""There is not one family member of his who has been left unaffected and not investigated,"" his mother, Luo Yun, who lives in Taiwan, told NPR.

Military personnel working under Title 32 or related structures often benefit from doctrines tied to their military status.
Taken together, these developments mark a period in which long-standing boundaries between civilian and military authority are being reconsidered.","Across the country, the United States is experiencing a shift that is unusual in its modern history. Although there is a long-standing norm against military involvement in civilian affairs, multiple kinds of military forces are increasingly entering roles traditionally carried out by civilian agencies. This now includes National Guard units, federally trained military personnel embedded in joint task forces, and Department of Defense (DOD)–supported operations appearing in everyday public safety contexts, often alongside federal enforcement partners such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), or U.S. Marshals participating in coordinated operations. These developments respond directly to the president’s call for a greater domestic military presence.

Notably, these roles are no longer confined to large-scale emergencies. Military personnel, who historically would be activated only for major disasters, are now participating in immigration enforcement operations, municipal policing activities, transit-hub monitoring, and other civilian spaces. The recent events in Memphis, Tennessee, provide the clearest example, though they are far from the only one. At the same time, federal policymakers are revisiting the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century statute, and exploring how it might be used inside the United States today.

Viewed together, these trends reflect a moment of genuine transformation. The United States is testing how far military participation in civilian life can extend, and that is not something we see often. This article explains what is happening, why it matters, and how these developments reflect a broader shift in the relationship between civilian and military authority.

The Memphis Deployment: A Case Study in Expanding Military Power

The recent deployment in Memphis illustrates how quickly military involvement in civilian contexts can escalate. In September 2025, after the federal government created a multi-agency public safety task force for the city, it requested military support from Tennessee. Governor Bill Lee activated the Tennessee National Guard under Title 32, which kept the Guard under nominal state control while integrating its personnel into a federally coordinated operation.1 Guard members were deputized as special federal officers and began participating in civil enforcement activities throughout Memphis.

Local and state officials immediately objected. They argued that the deployment violated both the Tennessee Constitution and the Tennessee Military Code. Under state law, the governor may activate the militia only during rebellion or invasion, and only when the General Assembly has determined that public safety requires it. None of those conditions existed. Memphis and Shelby County had also never requested assistance, even though state law requires a local request before the Guard can be used in this manner.

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Davidson County Chancery Court issued a temporary injunction halting the deployment. The court found no evidence of rebellion, invasion, or emergency conditions that would justify activation. Importantly, it also rejected the argument that the dispute was a non-justiciable political question.2 Because court intervention in National Guard deployments is rare, particularly those connected to federal initiatives, the ruling is significant.

The Memphis case now serves as a concrete example of the friction that emerges when federal authorities seek military involvement in local settings that state law does not support. It highlights how quickly federal strategy, state authority, and military power can collide and shows how easily these conflicts can reshape enforcement practices on the ground.

Title 32: A Federal Workaround With Expanding Domestic Use

Title 32 has quietly become one of the most consequential tools for bringing military personnel into civilian realms. It operates in a legal gray area where state authority and federal direction overlap. Under Title 32, National Guard members remain state personnel on paper but carry out missions shaped by federal priorities. As a result, they fall outside the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the federal government from using the Army or Air Force to carry out civilian law enforcement activities unless authorized by Congress.3 This makes Title 32 a powerful doorway through which the military can enter spaces where federal troops would normally be prohibited.

The Supreme Court emphasized this unusual flexibility in Perpich v. Department of Defense.4 The Court explained that the Guard does not serve a single sovereign: it can function as a state militia, as a Federal Reserve component, or as a fully federalized force. This fluidity is precisely what makes the Guard attractive when the federal government wants military participation without the legal constraints that normally limit military involvement in civil affairs.

Memphis demonstrates what happens when that flexibility is stretched to its limits. A federal request, a rapid state activation, and the Guard suddenly appeared inside a city’s public safety operations, despite the absence of the conditions required by Tennessee law. The court stopped the deployment, but the underlying tension remains. Title 32 now sits at the center of a larger question: How far can the federal government reach into local communities through a military force that is state-controlled only in name? And what happens when a statute designed for cooperative support becomes a mechanism for expanding state and federal power into spaces historically reserved for civilians?

The Alien Enemies Act and Why It Matters Now

The Alien Enemies Act (AEA) is among the oldest immigration-related statutes still in effect.5 The AEA gives the federal government broad wartime authority to detain, restrict, or remove noncitizens based solely on nationality whenever the United States is engaged in a declared conflict. Originally enacted in 1798 as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, the AEA is the only component of that package that remains active today. The Supreme Court upheld this sweeping authority in Ludecke v. Watkins6, deferring heavily to executive judgment in wartime.

Despite its age, the AEA continues to surface in contemporary enforcement debates. Recent litigation, including WMM v. Trump7, demonstrates how quickly the statute can be revived and adapted to new domestic contexts, even without a formal declaration of war. Reporting on the administration’s 2025 invocation of the AEA against Venezuelan nationals shows that the statute is no longer confined to traditional wartime contexts but is now appearing in immigration-enforcement and internal-security operations.8

The central concern is that the AEA was written for a very different era yet remains fully available today. Its broad grant of authority raises pressing questions about how far it might reach inside the United States and under what circumstances the executive could invoke it. As federal agencies consider potential modern uses of the AEA, the implications extend beyond doctrine. These choices affect community trust, perceptions of institutional legitimacy, and the practical boundary between national security powers and everyday civil life.

Accountability and Immunity for Military Actors

A central concern in the current enforcement environment is accountability: what happens when military personnel engage in civilian enforcement and something goes wrong? CLINIC Affiliates are already hearing reports from clients describing aggressive tactics, injuries during detentions, masked officers, and enforcement teams where authority lines are unclear. In such circumstances, identifying the responsible actor becomes extremely difficult.

A major contributor to this uncertainty is the overlapping immunities that apply to military-involved enforcement teams. National Guard members activated under Title 32 often retain state sovereign immunity, which shields state personnel from many civil damages claims. When deputized by the federal government, they may also receive federal immunity protections. Military personnel supporting civilian operations operate under additional doctrines that limit when and how they can be sued. These layers stack together to create deep accountability gaps.

Although these doctrines do not prevent courts from issuing injunctions — as the Memphis case illustrates — they significantly restrict the ability of individuals who have already experienced harm to pursue meaningful remedies. Many clients cannot determine whether the person who detained or injured them was acting as a state officer, a federal officer, a military actor, or some combination of the three. Masks, unmarked uniforms, and mixed teams only heighten the confusion.

The expanding presence of federal officers and deputized personnel in civilian environments also introduces broad qualified-immunity protections. Deputized officers operating under federal authority may receive federal immunity that local officers would not. Military personnel working under Title 32 or related structures often benefit from doctrines tied to their military status. As these categories blend together in joint operations, the accountability framework becomes nearly impossible for the public to navigate.

This is why Memphis matters: it exposed how quickly federal direction, state activation, and blurred military roles can collide, leaving communities without transparency or clear avenues for redress. The court’s injunction turned on basic structural problems, including the absence of statutory authority for activation under Tennessee law, the lack of any local request for assistance, and no identified emergency that would justify deploying the Guard. Yet the deployment had already placed National Guard members inside civilian public safety operations under federal coordination. In that environment, it becomes difficult for residents to understand which level of government authorized the operation, which agency controls the personnel on the ground, and where complaints or challenges should be directed.

The Growing Domestic Military Footprint

The Memphis deployment is not an isolated event but part of a larger national pattern. Military personnel are increasingly appearing in civilian spaces where they have seldom, if ever, been present. These spaces include courthouses, airports, transportation hubs, shelters, and local public safety operations. In some cities, Guard members or federally trained military support units have become visible inside operations that were previously handled exclusively by civilian agencies. National reporting has documented comparable deployments in cities such as Portland and Chicago, where the presence of mixed federal, state, and military teams has raised serious questions about oversight and accountability.

For immigrant communities, the consequences are profound. A visible military presence in civil enforcement settings undermines feelings of safety, erodes trust in institutions, and discourages people from seeking services or leaving their homes. For individuals who have previously experienced military-driven harm or come from countries where military involvement signals danger, these developments can be especially destabilizing.

More troubling is that these deployments are increasingly untethered from clear emergencies. Instead, they appear in routine public safety and enforcement contexts traditionally reserved for civilian agencies. This suggests a gradual normalization of military participation in domestic affairs, which is occurring without robust public debate about appropriate limits.

Looking Ahead

The Memphis injunction demonstrates that state courts still play a critical role in limiting domestic military involvement. But it also shows how quickly those limits can be tested when federal and state interests converge. Simultaneously, renewed attention to the Alien Enemies Act (a statute written for a radically different era) underscores the extent to which emergency powers are resurfacing in modern internal-enforcement debates.

Nationally, these issues are poised to escalate in WMM v. Trump, which raises foundational questions about the scope of presidential power, the use of wartime authorities in peacetime, and the due-process protections owed when the government targets individuals based solely on nationality. The Fifth Circuit is hearing the case en banc, and the stakes are significant enough that Supreme Court review appears likely. The Court has already intervened once through an emergency stay, and the core questions in the case go to the heart of how far the AEA can reach in contemporary America.

Taken together, these developments mark a period in which long-standing boundaries between civilian and military authority are being reconsidered. The rising use of Title 32, the increasing presence of military personnel in civilian spaces, and active litigation over wartime statutes all point toward a broader rethinking of internal enforcement strategy. The outcomes of these cases and policy decisions will shape the next phase of immigration enforcement and determine the role that military power will play inside the country.",https://www.cliniclegal.org/sites/default/files/CLINIC%20favicon.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:58:13.248630

On Dec. 11, the American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), Comitté de 100, Latino Chamber of Commerce of Southeast Wisconsin and other business leaders hosted a press conference at Milwaukee City Hall in downtown Milwaukee. The press conference urged reforms in the immigration system and how it impacts Wisconsin’s already shrinking workforce as it struggles to attract and retain talent in multiple sectors of business.

“Let’s begin by looking at the numbers. In 1960, Wisconsin’s fertility rate was 4.1; in 2020, it had fallen to 1.6. To maintain a population not counting on immigration, you need a fertility rate. We’re far below that threshold,” said Darrly Morin, president and CEO of Advanced Wireless Inc., and Comité de 100 state captain.

While fertility rates have fallen, Morin also noted the state’s unemployment rate of 3.1%. The rate contrasts with the number of available jobs with a 7-to-10 ratio for every 10 positions open, seven unemployed individuals are looking for a job. That translates to more than 32,500 jobs short if every unemployed person in Wisconsin gains employment.

The figures coincide with economic constraints in Wisconsin, Morin said. The state has an ample population of workers, but employers are looking elsewhere, as many without proper work authorization are unable to fill job openings.

“It means employers are competing, not only the companies and organizations from other states, but from other countries where they have more labor available,” Morin said. “It’s time for us to… start implementing solutions.”

Morin cited a November study from Marquette Law School looking at broad public opinion to give work permits to immigrants in the United States legally.

Results show that an overwhelming majority of respondents, both Democrat and Republican, support granting work permits to immigrants who have been in the U.S. legally for at least five years, have jobs and no criminal record.

Data shows 72% in favor — 89% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans. Morin and others urge Congress to take action.

“We have to return to a shared set of principles. One of these must be that the idea of hard work should be encouraged and rewarded“, said Milwaukee Alderman José Perez, D-12. “These aren’t handouts and little things. This is not a government subsidy. We are talking about an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay.”

Perez highlights how many immigrants are paying into U.S. systems without being able to receive any benefits. The most recent study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy showed that in 2022, undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in federal, state and local taxes.

Immigrants, particularly Latinos, as discussed in the press conference, are an economic driver — but not when they cannot obtain work permits, said Nelson Soler, president and CEO of the Latino Chamber of Commerce of Southeast Wisconsin.

Those without work permits cannot fully participate in the economy. The result leads to an increase in prices and gaps in job availability from slowed growth, Soler said.

“Employers in industries such as construction, hospitality, manufacturing and childcare report persistent workforce shortages,” Soler said. “These shortages slow economic growth and limit the ability of businesses, large and small, to be in demand. Those who have lived in our community for years, including Dreamers and long-term workers, are ready and willing to contribute more fully.”

Changes the organizations want to see fall within the spectrum of popular opinion from the Marquette Law School poll.

Hundreds of demonstrators, including faith leaders, blocked entrances and chained themselves to the doors of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday morning to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

The Department of Homeland Security said that 44 people were arrested. A reporter witnessed federal officers restraining a dozen people with zip ties.

The demonstration, which led to the office’s closure for the day, brought together ministers, rabbis, and imams who said they were taking direct action after months of bearing witness outside immigration courthouses where immigrants have been detained during legal proceedings. The protest was organized by a coalition called Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity.

“We’ve had enough of the racist ICE raids that have been going on, abducting people,” said the Rev. Kevin Mann, community minister at First Unitarian Church of Oakland. “In this building, hundreds of people have been abducted in the middle of legal court hearings.”

The 630 Sansome St. location serves as the headquarters for an ICE district that oversees operations from Oregon to Bakersfield, California.

Officers with the United States Federal Protective Service ordered the crowd to disperse at 9:45 a.m.; San Francisco police were stationed nearby, but did not appear to take part in detaining demonstrators. An hour later, there were between 100 and 150 people blocking an entrance to the building, holding signs with messages like “ICE out of CA” and chanting “This Little Light of Mine,” as firefighters used bolt cutters to sever the chains binding protesters together.

Faith leaders said they have maintained a presence outside Bay Area immigration courthouses since July, accompanying individuals to hearings. They said some people entering the buildings for legal proceedings were detained and have not been released.

“People are being abducted during this Christmas season, during this time of Hanukkah,” Mann said. “People should be home with their families and not rotting in some ICE jail detention centers somewhere.”

The Rev. Allison Tanner of Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church in Oakland said the interfaith group decided to escalate with a confrontational protest.

“After six months, we felt the need to escalate our presence — not just bear witness but interrupt the injustice,” Tanner said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin decried Tuesday’s protest, saying in an emailed statement that “ over 200 rioters obstructed law enforcement outside the ICE processing center in San Francisco, California.”

After San Francisco Fire Department firefighters arrived to cut chains, McLaughlin said the people arrested by ICE and United States Federal Protective Service officers “appear to be U.S. citizens.”

San Francisco has been a flashpoint for immigration protests since the summer.

In June, police arrested roughly 150 people during a demonstration against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Two days later, hundreds of protesters shut down operations at the Sansome Street building. In July, tensions escalated when agents drove a van into a group of protesters outside the immigration court at 100 Montgomery St., continuing down the street for a block as a protester clung to the hood.

In October, tensions across the Bay Area intensified after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy federal agents to the region as part of an immigration enforcement surge. He abruptly canceled the plan after lobbying by tech billionaires and a phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie.

to conceive, sponsored the proposal and harshly criticized its omission from the final bill.
Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees said the legislation contained the largest overhaul of military acquisition in decades.","The Senate on Wednesday gave final approval to a $900 billion defense policy bill, clearing legislation that advances the bulk of President Trump’s national security agenda and modernizes the way the U.S. military buys weapons and supplies, while also seeking to reassert congressional oversight of military operations.

The 77-to-20 vote reflected bipartisan support in Congress to continue to spend robustly on defense, including on new submarines, fighter jets and drone technology. The bill also includes a pay raise of 3.8 percent for military personnel.

While the Trump administration has made steep cuts to the federal government over the past year, the price tag on the bill was $8 billion above what the White House had requested for the Pentagon for the next year. Still, Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days.

The measure puts bipartisan pressure on the Pentagon to be more transparent with Congress about the boat strikes the Trump administration has carried out in international waters; officials have said, without offering public evidence, they are targeting people trafficking narcotics to the United States. The legislative provision would mandate the release of the specific orders behind the strikes and unedited videos of the attacks to lawmakers, and withhold 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the administration does not comply.

The bill would also block the Trump administration from withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, after a recent decision to reduce the Pentagon’s footprint in Germany, Romania and Poland drew ire from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Specifically, the bill prohibits Mr. Hegseth from reducing the number of troops “permanently stationed in or deployed” to Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, unless the Pentagon first consults NATO allies and certifies to Congress that such a drawdown would not put U.S. national security at risk.

The legislation also overcame resistance from hard-right Republicans, who have long criticized funding the defense of foreign allies, and authorizes another $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, as well as millions more for Israel, Taiwan, Iraq and other allies.

The bill does not rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, the preferred moniker of the Trump administration.

Republicans in Congress included several changes, however, aimed at reversing Biden-era policies at the Pentagon, including a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and funding cuts for climate-related programs. An attempt by House Republicans to bar the Defense Department from covering gender-transition surgeries for troops did not ultimately make it into the measure.

Also removed in final negotiations was a provision that would have covered in vitro fertilization treatments for service members struggling with infertility. Democrats had hoped Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to make I.V.F. more accessible would draw Republican backing for the change, but conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson killed it for the second year in a row.

Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a veteran who relied on I.V.F. to conceive, sponsored the proposal and harshly criticized its omission from the final bill.

“Republicans repeatedly make promises to the public that they support I.V.F., but their extreme actions tell a different story from their lip service during election years,” she said in a statement.

Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees said the legislation contained the largest overhaul of military acquisition in decades. It aims to streamline the delivery of weapons and supplies to troops, in part by reducing regulations on military purchasing.

“We’re about to pass, and the president will enthusiastically sign the most sweeping upgrades to D.O.D.’s business practices in 60 years,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday. “This is a monumental achievement.”

The bill repeals authorizations for the use of military force that date back to the Iraq and Persian Gulf wars. Democrats and Republicans have called for years to end the 2002 and 1991 authorizations, frustrated by presidents of both parties relying on them to greenlight all manner of military operations since.

It also ends sweeping sanctions on Syria. Since the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad, lawmakers in both parties have supported lifting the sanctions to promote Syria’s economic recovery from more than a decade of civil war.

A much-criticized section of the final measure permits military aircraft to fly in the airspace around Ronald Reagan National Airport outside Washington with their enhanced tracking software turned off during national security missions, or if the Pentagon determines the flight does not pose a risk to commercial planes.

Senators Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, sought to strike the provision, warning that allowing military aircraft to fly undetected creates dangerous conditions that led to the midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial jet in January.

“If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”","These concerns are noted repeatedly in interviews with policing experts and community members, and in lawsuits challenging troop deployments in several American cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Memphis, Tennessee.

In Chicago, ICE agents began using increasingly aggressive tactics in September during what President Donald Trump dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” It was a response, ICE said, to crimes committed by migrants in Illinois without documentation. The scenes have been dramatic by design: an overnight raid on an apartment building, with Blackhawk helicopters and U.S. citizens dragged into the street in zip-ties. The tactics have resulted in at least one death: In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González while attempting to pull him over and arrest him.

Locals in Chicago have turned out in force to protest, leading to daily demonstrations at an ICE processing center outside Chicago and elsewhere throughout the city. In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.

Nevertheless, the presence of immigration agents in the city — with their military-style uniforms and tactics — has made it harder, prosecutors argue in a federal lawsuit, to pursue cases against people accused of violent crimes in Chicago.

In one case, the wife of a man who had been murdered did not want to come to court to testify for fear of being arrested by Homeland Security agents. Her fear of arrest “makes it more likely that her husband’s murderers will go free and justice will be denied,” wrote Jose Villarreal, a prosecutor with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, in court documents.

Villarreal listed a wide array of crimes that his office can no longer prosecute because of ICE’s presence in the city: children who are victims of sexual assault, whose mothers fear that bringing them to court might lead to their arrest by immigration agents; domestic violence cases where victims fear testifying because of immigration agents stationed at the courthouse, meaning “the predators who victimized them may walk free.”

Amid the Trump administration’s insistence that its immigration enforcement is meant to ensure law and order, Villarreal argued that Homeland Security’s actions in and around courthouses in Chicago have made it harder “to protect the victims of violent crime and uphold the law through criminal prosecution.” A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office declined a request to interview Villarreal, citing the pending litigation.

Calls to 911 have dropped precipitously in the city since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Chicago Tribune reported, especially in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village. “They don’t really want to call the police because they associate the police with ICE,” Dolores Castañeda, a community activist, told the Tribune. As a result, residents “are feeling more unsafe than ever before.”

After the Trump administration began to flood Memphis with both National Guardsmen and other federal law enforcement agents in October, residents said that traffic stops by officers armed with assault rifles dressed in military garb made them feel less safe. “It makes everyone feel like a criminal. So you just literally criminalize the whole of Memphis,” said Keedran Franklin, a community organizer there.

In Memphis, where local police have struggled to build trust with communities of color — under the Biden administration, the Memphis Police Department was under investigation for using excessive force and racially profiling Black and brown residents — local police officers have been working side-by-side with the federal agents, doing traffic stops and executing warrants. In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.

“That’s only made the relationship even more strained,” said Amber Sherman, a community activist and a member of a police reform task force in the city. “And I didn’t think there was a chance of repair anyways, but I definitely don’t think there is one now. Just because of the level of trauma that’s being inflicted every single day.” The Memphis Police Department did not respond to a request to comment on Sherman’s concerns.

The playbook in Memphis was different from the other cities, because unlike governors in California and Illinois, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, supported the move. Several hundred federal law enforcement officers — from the National Guard and a wide range of other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — arrived to participate in an action the government called “Memphis Safe Task Force.” But the county’s Democratic mayor, Lee Harris, has since sued the governor and others. The enormous influx of troops led to over 1,000 arrests, and local jails do not have the capacity to hold that many people. Weeks after the task force began operating, Harris declared a state of emergency to deal with overcrowding in the jails. By the end of October, troops were still there and had made hundreds of additional arrests.

In Los Angeles, where the Trump administration began deploying troops in June, Trump said that the aim was to protect federal employees and property from protesters who objected to ICE’s aggressive tactics when they descended on the city in tactical gear, conducting large-scale workplace raids. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials sued the Trump administration, arguing that military presence would “only escalate tensions” and “erode public trust.”

Their warnings were prescient. When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.

“Soldiers patrolling the streets of Los Angeles have not made anyone safer; indeed, the opposite is true,” according to court filings in California’s lawsuit to end the National Guard deployment. The Trump administration’s “confrontational decision to deploy the military in a civilian city serves only to spread fear and heighten tensions in Los Angeles. If anything, the presence of the military threatens to further destabilize the community and escalate a situation that calls for cool heads and steady hands.” About 100 troops remain stationed there, according to military officials.

In interviews with The Marshall Project and in court documents, police experts argue that National Guard troops and other militarized federal law enforcement make it harder for police to keep cities safe. “For some chiefs, this is their worst nightmare,” said Christy Lopez, a Georgetown Law professor who oversaw Constitutional policing enforcement at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. “They’ve been working with communities for years — decades — building trust with immigrant communities, marginalized communities. All it takes is one raid to destroy years of goodwill,” she said.

That’s because modern-day policing depends on trust. To prevent and solve crimes, police need community members to call them in emergencies and to cooperate in investigations — actions the public won’t take if they don’t trust that their concerns will be taken seriously. “True public safety is only possible when the community believes that their police department exists to serve them with fairness, equity, and respect,” wrote U. Renee Hall, former Dallas police chief, in a declaration filed in the Washington D.C., litigation, which began in early September, weeks after troops began patrolling the city with fatigues and armored vehicles.

Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said. “It’s all just people with guns who can tell you what to do.” Federal agents often wear tactical vests that say “POLICE” — although technically they are not — which further confuses people, said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer. “I don’t want the line blurred, because I don’t want ICE giving a bad name to police departments.”

Since the end of the Civil War, the idea that the military should not intervene in the country’s civil government — except in emergencies — has been enshrined in both law and our national values. A handful of such emergencies took place during the civil rights movement, when the federal government sent the National Guard to Southern states to assist with desegregating schools, at times over segregationist governors’ objections. The last time the National Guard was called into an American city was in 1992, when California’s governor requested assistance in Los Angeles amid riots after the acquittal of the White police officers caught on videotape beating Rodney King.

But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protests was at Kent State University in 1970. Amid escalating demonstrations against the Vietnam War, including a building on campus set ablaze, the mayor of Kent, Ohio, asked the state’s governor to send in troops. Shortly after arriving on campus, soldiers opened fire on a crowd, killing four college students.

In October, federal circuit court Judge Ronald M. Gould warned in a written dissent that “to have an armed military faced off against civilian protesters, whatever the motivation of the President, threatens to produce another tragedy, such as that occurring at Kent State University in 1970.” A majority of his colleagues on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Trump to continue with troop deployments in Los Angeles.

And this trend may yet continue. A Pentagon memo drafted in October outlined plans to train tens of thousands of National Guard troops across all 50 states to respond to civil unrest and be ready to deploy to American cities. And last week, speaking on an aircraft carrier near Tokyo. Trump told U.S. troops that deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities was just the beginning of his plans for dealing with crime. “If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/uploads/station/2095/fbShare.png?r=57652,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:29.228038

Immigrant journalists tell me that they have resorted to a range of different tactics to protect themselves, their immigrant staffers, and their audiences from violent immigration enforcement.
In a recent report on LGBTQ media, we are seeing these tactics employed by other vulnerable community media journalists.
Community journalists are also more siloed, isolated, and less visible than ever before.","It is no secret that both immigrants and journalists are under attack. Immigrant journalists face the double threat of trying to stay safe while running headlong into unsafe situations in order to do their jobs, and increasingly, a press pass or vest does little to prevent direct attacks or even arrest. However dangerous the circumstances are for all immigrant journalists, nowhere is the threat higher than for immigrant or exiled journalists working in in-language and community-based news media — a message heard loud and clear with the arrest and deportation of immigrant community journalist Mario Guevara.

Whether they are working at legacy ethnic press, or reporting for the hundreds of digital news outlets serving hyperlocal immigrant audiences, or operating in exile, immigrant journalists working in U.S. community media today must navigate a tightening grip on their First Amendment rights, immigration status, and personal safety — often from within the U.S. as well as overseas, and increasingly from within their own communities.

Over the course of the last year, the Asian Media Initiative at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism’s Center for Community Media worked with a group of immigrant and exiled journalists working in in-language and community-centered media serving Afghan American, Arab American, Bangladeshi American, Chinese-speaking, Indian American, and Indonesian American community journalists across the U.S. Many struggled not only to keep themselves safe, but also their predominantly immigrant reporting staff, as well as the undocumented and otherwise vulnerable immigrant audiences they served.

The journalists we worked with were on student visas, came from homelands at war or experiencing anti-democratic crackdowns, and lived in communities that were being targeted by immigration enforcement operations. Some of the print outlets’ most reliable advertisers were being influenced by extremist movements, powerful corporations, or state governments from abroad, as well as rising pressures from tariffs. All digital outlets were navigating transnational repression, surveillance from within the U.S., as well as escalating digital harassment and doxxing.

Like all community media led by and serving Black, Latino, AAPI, Indigenous, and LGBTQ audiences, these news outlets are understaffed and underresourced, often off the radar of major advertisers and news philanthropy. Sometimes, their efforts to cut costs can expose them to authoritarian tactics from overseas, such as Internet shutdowns commonly used as a tool of repression across South and Southeast cutting immigrant neighborhoods off from news during student uprisings in Nepal or Bangladesh, or amid military operations in Kashmir. Authoritarian regimes are taking notice of immigrant media — one Chinese-language journalist told me that a representative of state media routinely wrote down the names of publishers picking up their print editions from a local printer, and just a few months ago, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan made it illegal for local residents to “collaborate” with exiled media covering their circumstances for their refugee and diaspora news audiences.

In other instances, their efforts to engage their audiences on social media or messaging platforms can enable overseas governments to censor their work, ideological groups to organize harassment campaigns, so-called self-media to steal and modify their work, or invite vicious trolls and cybertroops. And in increasingly ideologically divided communities, small community-based newsrooms can find themselves facing threats, retaliation, intimidation, boycotts, and quid pro quo coverage demands from within their own communities.

Immigrant journalists tell me that they have resorted to a range of different tactics to protect themselves, their immigrant staffers, and their audiences from violent immigration enforcement. Some have their staffers on visas withhold bylines or pivot to desktop reporting rather than attend protests or attempt to cover enforcement operations. Others send volunteers with burner phones pre-loaded with immigration attorney contact information to accompany reporters. In a recent report on LGBTQ media, we are seeing these tactics employed by other vulnerable community media journalists.

In the nineteenth century, when ethnic press emerged alongside popular news media, the Black press served as the beacon for how journalism could advance multiracial democracy, advocating against Asian exclusion, hiring immigrant journalists who couldn’t find work in white-led media, and platforming LGBTQ writers.

Today, the so-called community media landscape is larger, more robust, and expanding faster than ever before, ranging from legacy ethnic newspapers to glossy magazines to podcasts and multimedia platforms to investigative and human rights documenting projects from journalists in exile. Community journalists are also more siloed, isolated, and less visible than ever before. If we believe that journalism can and should advance multiracial democracy, even at this moment when its future in the U.S. seems fragile and threatened, we must invest in immigrant-led media, and build strong networks that enable immigrant, LGBTQ, Black, and Indigenous journalists to share strategies, pool resources, collaborate on their reporting, and help keep each other safe.",https://www.niemanlab.org/images/Kavitha-Rajagopalan.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:06.584123

At least half a dozen providers have sued the state Department of Human Services in recent months over suspended payments, which they say have either shut down their businesses or put them at existential risk, harming the clients who depend on their services.

One lawsuit filed in August in district court was dismissed in early December. In another suit in October, a personal care assistant filed suit and DHS resumed Medicaid payments a week later.

A lawsuit from a provider against DHS from September is ongoing, and three additional lawsuits were filed just last week.

The litigation is yet another fallout from the Walz administration’s focus on rooting out fraud in public programs after years of inaction, beginning with the now-notorious Feeding Our Future case that led to more than 75 federal charges and has since morphed into a wide-ranging Medicaid fraud investigation.

The stakes are significant: Successful litigation could encourage more providers to sue, which would complicate the administration’s efforts to thwart the burgeoning fraud scandal — and with it, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2026 reelection efforts.

Provider lawsuit dismissed by district court

A district court dismissed a lawsuit from Empathy Home Care in August in which the provider alleged that DHS stopped payments for its assisted living services starting in May but offered no evidence of fraud.

Michael Schwartz, Empathy Home Care’s attorney, said that “the state’s response to allegations of widespread fraud is being dealt with by just shutting payments off to a whole blanket of people, including Empathy, who’ve done nothing wrong.”

According to a court memo from the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, evidence gathered by DHS indicated that Empathy Home Care billed for services that it didn’t provide. The memo also said that DHS had evidence that Medicaid recipients went missing when services were supposed to be provided and overdosed without staff attempting to save them.

Much of Empathy’s legal argument rests on a new section in Minnesota statute that limits payment stoppages from all state agencies to 60 days if there’s evidence of fraud. But an older Minnesota statute, which applies specifically to Medicaid-funded services, allows DHS to impose sanctions on Medicaid providers until “the commissioner determines there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the individual or entity, or after legal proceedings relating to the alleged fraud are completed.”

The Minnesota 4th District Court ruled in early December that the older statute is in force, allowing DHS to continue to withhold payment beyond the 60 days allowed in the new statute. Historically, under the older statute, state and federal courts have not allowed Medicaid program providers the right to appeal payment sanctions.

Schwartz said that Empathy plans to appeal the court’s decision this week.

Integrated Community Supports provider sues

The three providers that filed lawsuits against DHS last week range in what services they provide and why DHS suspended their payments.

Bright Community Services says it helps more than 30 adults through Integrated Community Support services, a program that has been under scrutiny by DHS. The program started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution.

Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS paused payments for some ICS providers starting in September and implementing a prepayment auditing process this month for 14 programs, including ICS.

DHS has withheld payments to 17 ICS providers as of late November. Bright Community Services was one of them — but, like Empathy Home Care, the business alleges that DHS suspended its payments without explanation. It also said that it asked DHS “on numerous occasions” for further explanation of the fraud allegation but received no response.

Bright Community Services has stopped offering services because it’s now unable to pay staff, according to the lawsuit. DHS has said that providers are still allowed to continue providing services while they stop payments.

“No business can reasonably be expected to do that,” reads the lawsuit from Bright Community Services.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed in a statement that all payments to Bright Community Services were suspended based on “credible allegations of fraud,” which have also been referred to law enforcement. The statement also said that payments may resume if the provider submits sufficient information to demonstrate that there was no fraud.

Lataa Elemo, who operates Bright Community Services, declined an interview request. So far, no providers have faced state or federal charges for defrauding ICS.

DHS investigating connections between different providers

DHS is also investigating and pausing payments for providers affiliated with other providers suspected of fraud.

Two Medicaid program providers partly owned by the same person, Suleiman Isse — Joy Home Healthcare and Hennepin Autism Center — filed a lawsuit against DHS in September over payments halted in June.

DHS said in a notice that it suspended payments to Hennepin Autism in part because it had evidence that the autism center participated in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which the autism center denied. DHS additionally suspended payments to Joy Home Healthcare because of its shared ownership with Hennepin Autism.

That lawsuit is ongoing. The attorney representing the providers declined to comment.

Another provider, Agape Home Care Services, received a notice from DHS in September that the business was cut off from payments because of its affiliation with another provider under investigation for fraud, Healthy Living Home Care, according to another recent lawsuit.

Agape doesn’t provide ICS services but does provide other home- and community-based services, as well as nursing services, that are also paid through state-run Medicaid programs.

Michael Hunter, the co-owner of Agape, said that he owns 30% of Healthy Living Home Care but plays no part in the business operations of Healthy Living.

“Because someone has a stake in another company, you put another whole company on payment hold,” Hunter said. “We are not being accused of any wrongdoing, nothing like that.”

Since the payment hold started, Agape has had to stop providing services to all of its clients, Hunter said. The organization usually has 10 to 15 clients, many of whom have intense behavioral and medical needs and were sent to the hospital once services stopped, he said.

Hunter said that Healthy Living Home Care is still waiting to hear why their payments are being withheld. According to Hunter, DHS surveyed Healthy Living but “there was nothing on fraud” in the survey.

DHS and government officials have provided limited information, citing active investigations.

“Hopefully it’s understandable that we don’t want to be too forthcoming about what kinds of actions cause investigators to suspect someone is billing for services they didn’t provide, but in general we look for patterns of concern,” said a DHS spokesperson, in an email.

As in Empathy’s case, Agape’s lawsuit and another lawsuit recently filed by Benevolence LLC, an autism services provider, make the case that DHS can only stop payments for 60 days under the new statute.

A representative from Benevolence LLC declined to comment.

Federal investigators have charged one person for defrauding the autism program. The investigation emerged out of the Feeding Our Future investigation; state spending on autism services exploded by 3,000% in recent years.

Suing the state has been a successful strategy in the past

In yet another lawsuit, a personal care assistant alleged in October that her payments for taking care of her disabled son were suspended two years ago, and that she wasn’t given information or a timeline on DHS’s fraud investigation.

Joseph Dixon, the attorney for the personal care assistant, said that DHS “simply withdrew the payment suspension” rather than respond to the lawsuit, making the case moot.

Feeding Our Future, the nonprofit at the center of a $250 million scheme defrauding the federal government of pandemic money intended to feed children, filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Minnesota Department of Education when the agency stopped processing applications for new meal sites. Feeding Our Future accused the agency of discriminating on the basis of race, national origin and religion.

Though the judge hearing the case never issued a written order for the Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future, he did say the state did not have authority to stop payments, according to a transcript of a 2021 hearing reviewed by the Star Tribune. Though stopped payments were outside of the purview of the lawsuit, which centered on meal site applications, MDE resumed payments six days later.

In 2022, MDE said in a statement that “the court made it clear that if MDE were to continue the legal fight to withhold payments, MDE would incur sanctions and legal penalties.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-photo-fraud-committee-mj-1024x6841765988255.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=8cXWm9bL,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:33.616533

The findings come from Prison Policy Initiative, a national nonprofit that studies mass incarceration in the United States.

Researchers found that agreements between ICE and local law enforcement have become an essential part of increased deportation efforts under the Trump administration. The collaborations allow state police, troopers and corrections officers to act as local arms of the national immigration enforcement agency, carrying out arrests at a growing rate.

In Oklahoma, that means arrests at local jails and lock-ups accounted for half of the 2,323 people arrested for immigration charges in the state between May 21 and October 15.

People who have already been booked into custody by local law enforcement are being flagged for immigration charges at facilities collaborating with ICE.

But researchers say large numbers of ICE arrests at local jails are not an indication that immigrants and asylum seekers are more likely to be arrested for a crime. Robust data from Texas, for example, showed that undocumented immigrants had much lower arrest rates than U.S.-born citizens. Instead, in too many cases, a traffic stop can mean deportation, the report says.

The 1,176 people arrested on immigration charges in Oklahoma jails recently could have entered custody for any number of reasons.

In general, most people in jails have not been convicted of a crime. Over 80% of people in jails have not been convicted and are legally presumed innocent. Most are held for low-level offenses like loitering and public intoxication, not violent crimes.

In Oklahoma, ICE has also started relying on local jails and shuttered prisons to hold people with immigration cases.

Agreements with local law enforcement can take many forms. As of August, 18 local law enforcement agencies had signed 287(g) contracts, allowing them to interrogate and arrest people for federal immigration violations, and then hold them for deportation processing.

ICYMI: Senator Murray Condemns Egregious Use of Force by ICE as Constituent is Mauled by Attack Dog, Demands Release from NWIPC to Receive Appropriate Medical Care

KUOW: Inside the black box of ICE detention in Tacoma, she watched her wedding day come and go

***LETTER HERE***

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, led Members of the Washington state Congressional delegation in a letter to Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons, expressing grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and demanding answers to a long list of questions regarding overcrowding and lack of access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for individuals detained at the facility. The population at NWIPC has ballooned over the past year under the Trump administration’s indiscriminate and cruel mass deportation campaign, nearing—and at times exceeding—the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575.

Joining Senator Murray in sending the letter to ICE were: Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Rick Larsen (D, WA-02), Emily Randall (D, WA-06), Pramila Jayapal (D, WA-07), Kim Schrier (D, WA-08), Adam Smith (D, WA-09), and Marilyn Strickland (D, WA-10).

“Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility,” the Members wrote in their letter. “In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity. None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.”

“It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities,” the lawmakers continued. “With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.”

In the letter, the Members raise concern over the lack of medical care for individuals detained at NWIPC and other ICE facilities, writing: “We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens. Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care.”

Recently, Senator Murray called attention to the violent assault of Wilmer Toledo-Martinez in Vancouver, Washington—condemning the officers who sicced an attack dog on Wilmer, despite him not resisting arrest, and calling for Wilmer to be immediately released from ICE custody. Wilmer is currently being held at NWIPC, where he has been unable to obtain adequate medical care. In a visit to NWIPC by Senator Murray’s staff in August, facility staff indicated that NWIPC only employed four behavioral health staffers for a population of approximately 1,500 detainees. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. In July 2024, after the death of a man detained at NWIPC, Senator Murray requested a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody from the Government Accountability Office (GAO)—that review is currently underway.

The lawmakers’ letter also draws attention to reports from advocates that at least three pregnant women detained at NWIPC over the past year have been unable to receive appropriate medical care. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility. Senator Murray has long fought against the mistreatment of pregnant women in detention, including by pushing for her legislation—the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act—to end the practice of shackling pregnant women in ICE detention. Murray also led an oversight letter to ICE in September demanding answers and accountability about the mistreatment of pregnant women in detention facilities under the Trump administration.

The Members continued by raising concerns over the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC and difficulty that detained individuals have in accessing legal counsel, writing: “Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The letter concludes by requesting answers to a list of questions by January 16th regarding capacity and staffing levels at NWIPC, the provision of food and medical care, access to legal counsel, treatment of pregnant women, and recent facility visits. “Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility,” the Members wrote. “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect. Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”

Senator Murray and other members of Washington state’s Congressional delegation have been conducting oversight of NWIPC throughout this year, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to block Congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. After a protracted legal battle over Washington state’s ability to enforce health and safety standards at NWIPC, a federal appeals court ruled in August that the state should be allowed to enforce such standards at the detention center, and that failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation.

Senator Murray has championed comprehensive and humane immigration reform throughout her time in Congress, and has consistently pushed for greater oversight of conditions at NWIPC. In 2024 at a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing, Murray asked then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to commit to an independent investigation of conditions at NWIPC and pressed him on the overuse of solitary confinement at ICE detention facilities—which Senator Murray has consistently spoken out against. While Chair of Appropriations, Senator Murray secured language in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024—which was signed into law in March 2024—to ensure stronger oversight of federal detention facilities and provisions to increase transparency. Senator Murray is also an original cosponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would set humane standards for detention facilities and increase oversight. Murray was outspoken in her opposition to the Laken Riley Act earlier this year, arguing it threatened civil liberties and would divert resources away from detaining true threats to public safety.

The lawmakers’ full letter to ICE is available HERE and below:

Dear Acting Director Lyons:

We are writing to share our grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and to request information about access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for detained noncitizens at the facility. Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility. In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity.

None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.

You must ensure the facility complies with the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards as revised in 2016 (PBNDS 2011) to keep detained noncitizens safe and healthy while protecting the rights they are entitled to under law.

It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities. With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.

Medical Care

The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to protect the health of individuals in its custody. We have had long-standing concerns about access to medical services in ICE detention facilities. In recent years, several members of the Washington Congressional delegation requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody. At times this year, NWIPC has exceeded 1,500 individuals in custody, nearing the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575 individuals. We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens.

Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care. During an August 2025 site visit, facility staff indicated the facility employed only four behavioral health staffers. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. It is plainly inadequate to have four behavioral health staff serving the 1,500 detainees under the facility’s care, especially given the fact that serious behavioral health issues frequently emerge under the severe stress of detention. We are also alarmed by reports from advocates with access to the facility that at least three detained pregnant women at NWIPC have been unable to receive appropriate medical care, even after they request specialty prenatal care appointments. Regular exams such as ultrasounds are necessary to monitor development and ensure a healthy pregnancy. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

Food

The Seattle Times recently reported on the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC as the detained population has increased. Advocates who speak with detainees have shared that meals are provided late and, in some cases, detainees did not receive three meals per day. Detainees have made complaints about food and sanitation for many years, and we urge the facility to be responsive to the nutritional needs of individuals in its custody. Legal service providers with access to the facility have also shared that detainees waiting for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings may miss meals. We urge the facility to ensure that all detained noncitizens, including those awaiting hearings or visits, are provided a minimum of three meals per day, as required by national detention standards (PBNDS 2011).

Access to Legal Counsel

Access to legal resources for noncitizens in immigration detention supports their ability to understand their rights and navigate immigration court, preventing backlogs in the immigration court system. Detained noncitizens at NWIPC face several concerning barriers to accessing legal counsel. Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients. This August, two of the seven attorney visitation rooms were being used as Virtual Attorney Visitation rooms (VAVs) and two were being used for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings, leaving only three rooms available for attorneys to meet with their clients in person. We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms.

In the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress provided $10,000,000 for ICE to improve legal resources for noncitizen detainees, including to expand video attorney visitation. During an August 2025 site visit, NWIPC staff indicated that the facility recently implemented a new scheduling system to reserve attorney visitation rooms. We ask that the facility work with attorneys to resolve any issues that arise with the new system expeditiously so as not to delay access to legal counsel. We urge you to improve access to legal counsel by ensuring attorney visitation rooms remain available for attorneys to meet with their clients.

Given these concerns, we request answers to the following questions by January 16, 2026:

What is the maximum capacity of NWIPC, as determined by the fire marshal? As of November 1, 2025, how many individuals were detained at the facility?

How many staff were employed by NWIPC on January 20, 2025? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provided direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many staff were employed by NWIPC? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provide direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many pregnant women were detained at NWIPC? How often have these women requested, and how often have they received, prenatal care appointments with a specialist?

How many days in the last six months has the facility not provided three meals each day to every noncitizen in its custody?

Why did the facility not provide three meals each day to every noncitizen?

For each day, for how many noncitizens were three meals not provided?

What is the current status of the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at NWIPC? Are noncitizens able to access LOP daily? What are the hours of availability each day? Outside of hours, are there any other restrictions on daily LOP access, and if so, what are they and why are they in place?

How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for in-person attorney meetings? How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for virtual attorney meetings?

In the last six months, have the attorney visitation rooms been used for a purpose other than attorney-client meetings (in-person or virtual) or video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings?

When were the most recent facility visits by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General, DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and ICE oversight personnel (whether the Office of Professional Responsibility or otherwise)? What, if any, recommendations were made after each visit? What progress has been made to implement such recommendations?

OIDO issued a report in November 2024 following an inspection of NWIPC. While 11 of the recommendations have been addressed, one remains outstanding. What progress has been made on implementing the remaining recommendation?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility.

We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.

Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.

Sincerely,

Yet 2025 was not solely defined by restrictionism or international discord. The number of forcibly displaced individuals declined for the first time in years, the landscape for certain workers diversified, and some regional blocs continued their marches towards greater integration.

Governments across high-income countries slashed tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid and development support in 2025, in what the United Nations described as the sharpest funding cuts to international humanitarian efforts in history. The reductions had immediate and potentially irreversible impacts on humanitarian and migration organizations and the people they serve worldwide.

By midyear, humanitarian aid globally was down 40 percent from the prior year, leading to steep downsizing. While cuts affected all manner of humanitarian projects, billions of dollars targeted migration-related issues.

For refugees and other forcibly displaced people, the cuts resulted in reduced food, closed health facilities, and greater exposure to natural disasters, among other impacts. To take just one example, at the world’s largest refugee settlement, in Myanmar, most schools were temporarily shuttered midyear, cases of children with acute malnutrition rose by 11 percent from January to September, and reports of child marriage and child labor rose. Elsewhere, refugees were left stranded at the borders of Chad and South Sudan because aid workers did not have the money to bus them to safer locations. In Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, reduced food rations led to violent protests and prompted more than 6,000 South Sudanese refugees to return to their homeland.

In coming years, the funding changes are projected to lead to significantly more deaths than would have otherwise occurred. As many as 14 million deaths by 2030 could be attributable to the effective shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to one study.

The cuts in foreign aid were made across the U.S. federal government, which has historically been the world’s top aid provider, as well as by Canada, the United Kingdom, European Union countries, and South Korea. Although official development assistance had already been trending downward, the 2025 cuts were transformative. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) planned to trim its budget by one-quarter and by October had laid off nearly 5,000 staffers. The World Food Program was working to reduce staff by more than one-quarter by 2026, resulting in the elimination of some 6,000 posts. Similar dynamics affected agencies and organizations of all sizes.

Political leaders justified the reductions by saying the foreign aid did not serve taxpayers’ interests, had to be reduced to offset increased defense spending, or was otherwise unnecessary. In several cases, governments cut humanitarian assistance while boosting funds for stiffer immigration enforcement. The U.S. Congress for instance allocated more than $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement purposes, an unprecedented increase and roughly similar to the $173 billion that had gone to USAID over the prior four fiscal years. In Europe, governments sought to pivot their migration-related spending from focusing on humanitarian and integration issues to reducing irregular movement.

In the long run, the cuts could lead to new displacement, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi warned, as tensions in migrants’ origin locations are exacerbated and transit countries lack the capacity to effectively accommodate migrants in need. Danish Refugee Council analysis suggested that U.S. cuts alone could be responsible for as many as 3.9 million more people displaced in 2025, effectively doubling the number of newly displaced people this year. At the same time, heightened border restrictions (see Item 7. Amid a Global Restrictionist Turn, Irregular Migration Drops—But Will It Last?) in many high-income countries and global withdrawal from offering legal avenues for refugees (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses) meant that many forcibly displaced people were left with few options.

Notably, some of the eliminated foreign aid programs had been designed to prevent unauthorized migration or bolster support in transit countries. At least $200 million in grants and funds terminated by the Trump administration were focused specifically on deterring irregular migration from Central America, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis. In Ecuador, the loss of international aid was cited as a reason for canceling the government’s planned offer of regularization to Venezuelan migrants, amid a broader regional change in tone towards displaced Venezuelans.

While jarring on its own, the shift was especially notable given its break from a recent trend towards addressing the “root causes” of migration, in order to reduce the appeal of irregular movement in the first place. Given the breadth of the impact and the fact that multiple aid organizations are planning for even starker budget shortfalls in 2026, the cuts may amount to a wholesale remaking of the humanitarian and development assistance system for years to come.

2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump

President Donald Trump returned to office in January intent on profoundly altering the United States’ relationship with immigration, and quickly got to work retooling U.S. policy and seeking to reshape public attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. Within hours of his swearing-in, Trump began pursuing an historic number of deportations, reshaping the legal immigration system to be significantly more exclusive, reducing services to resident immigrants and their U.S.-born children, and reconfiguring how the United States—long home to more immigrants than any other country—considers the foreign born as part of its collective identity.

Most visible by far was the campaign for mass deportations. The administration pledged to remove 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year (although the total in 2025 will likely be closer to 600,000), and it corralled virtually every arm of the sprawling U.S. federal government to assist. Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and other agencies were surged to U.S. cities from coast to coast, engaging in high-profile and often confrontational operations in neighborhoods, workplaces, and previously off-limits locations including schools and faith-based organizations. Congress allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years, transforming it into the largest federal law enforcement agency and prompting a quick scaling-up of detention space. The administration also terminated or allowed the expiration of multiple temporary statuses that had previously protected millions of unauthorized immigrants from being deported and allowed them to work legally.

U.S. officials were keen to highlight the punitive nature of the operations—including with memes and jokes—as part of an apparent effort to encourage unauthorized immigrants to “self-deport.”

While less sensationalist, policy changes affecting new legal arrivals and the millions of people in immigrant families—including large numbers of U.S.-born children—may prove to be even more impactful in years to come. The administration restricted or barred arrivals from 19 countries, imposed bonds of up to $15,000 for visitors of certain other nationalities, toughened the test for immigrants looking to become U.S. citizens, and added a $100,000 fee for new H-1B high-skilled visas, among other changes. The administration also began more closely policing noncitizens’ words and actions, including university student Mahmoud Khalil and other green-card holders whom the administration sought to deport for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, as well as visa holders who had posted negative comments about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. A vast web of government data, newly handed over to immigration enforcement, is helping facilitate the vetting and serve the broader deportation agenda (see Item 5. Big Brother Hits the World of Immigration Full Force). The administration is making all 55 million holders of a U.S. visa subject to “continuous vetting,” including of their social media, and in December proposed requiring applicants for visa-free travel to provide five years’ of social media activity.

Other changes did not explicitly target the foreign born but promised to have sweeping effects on people of immigrant backgrounds. Most symbolic was the effort to end the promise of birthright citizenship, which is widely understood to be enshrined to the Constitution and was quickly paused by the courts (the Supreme Court will review the order in 2026). Other moves—such as making English the country’s official language, suing states offering in-state college tuition to some residents who are unauthorized immigrants, trying to cut funding for early childhood centers and other initiatives seen as “woke,” and further reducing access to public benefits—sought to more broadly make a distinction between people with a long ancestry in the United States and those with a more recent history.

“America is not a nation of immigrants,” a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official claimed in November, illustrating the government’s posture and refuting a widely held narrative in place since at least the 1950s. “We are a nation of citizens. And it is because of those citizens that we are an exceptional nation.”

As result of this shift in tone, many immigrants’ fear their relationship with their adopted country is changing. Large numbers of immigrants—including many naturalized citizens—told pollsters they feared being arrested and deported, and modified their daily habits to be less visible. Enrollment of new international students at U.S. universities dropped by 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as many opted for other destinations (see Item 4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps). International travel to the United States also appeared to decline, for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

It remains too early to tell whether the Trump administration’s approach will lead to a fundamental shift in the size and composition of the U.S. immigrant population. But after one year in power, the outcome certainly seemed possible.

3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses

Long-agreed norms against pushing people back to places where they might be subject to harm underwent further backsliding in 2025. The prohibition on returning refugees and other people to precarious situations is decades old, but nonetheless seemed to be skirted or outright ignored in some cases this year; elsewhere, governments made express calls to rewrite international human-rights frameworks.

No place was this clearer than in the return this year of more than 2.7 million Afghans to their Taliban-controlled homeland, where residents face harsh restrictions on daily life and roughly half the country is confronting some sort of economic or environmental crisis. UN officials have repeatedly warned that returnees face serious human-rights threats, including the possibility of torture.

The overwhelming majority of Afghan returnees arrived from Iran or Pakistan, which have long been among the world’s largest refugee hosts but have grown more restrictive amid economic downturns and security concerns. Both countries have been running formal campaigns to encourage or force returns since 2023; these kicked into high gear this year. Germany began deportation flights to Afghanistan in 2024; Austria followed suit in 2025, and pressure increased for returns from more EU Member States. Under the Trump administration, the United States ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans in July and in some cases detained Afghans who had previously assisted U.S. military operations in the country. The U.S. government’s approach turned particularly stiff in the aftermath of the late November shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, allegedly committed by an Afghan national who arrived in 2021.

Elsewhere, a new asylum law in Egypt that transfers responsibility for refugee status determination from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Egyptian government was reportedly linked to an uptick in arrests and deportations of asylum seekers and others fleeing civil war in Sudan—including individuals with UNHCR legal documents. And while many people returned to Syria voluntarily, sizable numbers were also deported there—including from the European Union—or otherwise compelled to return in the months following the late 2024 overthrow of the Assad regime, amid a wide diplomatic rapprochement with the new leadership in Damascus (see Item 8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?).

In other cases, the United States and other countries stretched the limits of the humanitarian protection system by shipping individuals to third-country destinations of questionable repute. U.S. officials deported asylum seekers and other unauthorized immigrants to places such as El Salvador, where some were swiftly locked in the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison and allegedly tortured. Others were sent to a range of countries particularly in Africa, including South Sudan, which only recently emerged from a protracted civil war.

Similar proposals in Europe struggled to get off the ground, but rarely for lack of trying (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). Migrant holding centers built by Italy in Albania, in which migrants were set to wait while their asylum claims were handled by Italian officials, were opened in 2024 but sat empty for large portions of 2025 after courts intervened. EU and British leaders also considered sending migrants whose asylum claims were denied to third countries to which they have no prior ties, known as “return hubs;” the European Council established the legal grounds for creating these facilities in December.

Meanwhile, refugee resettlement globally fell sharply. By mid-2025, just one-third as many refugees had been resettled as in the same period in 2024, a decline partly attributable to the United States, which has historically been the world leader in refugee resettlement. The U.S. program was suspended indefinitely in 2025, after President Donald Trump returned to office and embraced a more restrictive immigration approach (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump). Later in the year, the United States granted entry to a small number of White South Africans and said that it would accept no more than 7,500 refugees from South Africa or other homelands engaging in “illegal or unjust discrimination” in fiscal year (FY) 2026, down from a ceiling of 125,000 the previous year. The administration redirected a reported $250 million from the U.S. refugee resettlement program to encourage “self-deportations.”

In some cases, governments are seeking to rewrite the international rules undergirding national policies. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, U.S. officials made a soft pitch for dramatically rethinking the 1951 Refugee Convention, notably not including a mention of upholding the principle of nonrefoulement, which prevents return to a location where someone might face persecution. Although the Trump administration had reportedly considered withdrawing the United States from the Refugee Convention, it now appears to be eyeing amendments to the Convention through a new Protocol.

Several governments in Europe meanwhile sought to either modify or reinterpret the European Convention on Human Rights, which has in the past been interpreted to prevent efforts by France, Greece, and other nations to tighten asylum laws. In May, leaders of nine EU Member States called for the Convention to be reinterpreted to loosen restrictions on repatriating migrants convicted of criminal offenses, seemingly to allow for return of those individuals to countries deemed unsafe; in December, more than two dozen countries said it was “imperative” that the framework “is fit to address today’s challenges” on managing migration and asylum.

Collectively, the trends suggest the steady winnowing of access to asylum is here to stay and may accelerate.

4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps

While the story of migration in 2025 was generally speaking one of tightened borders and stricter enforcement, several under-the-radar trends showcased how countries with aging populations and shrinking birthrates are seeking to fill labor market and skills gaps, particularly in high-skill sectors. Governments rolled out new visas for these workers, in some cases keying off policy changes in other countries to make themselves more competitive.

Even as it tightened restrictions on some types of immigration, the United Kingdom planned to double the number of high-skilled visas for foreign workers. China meanwhile unveiled a new K visa targeting young high-tech workers and researchers who meet certain criteria, in what was seen as a response to U.S. hardening of its policies for high-skilled immigrants. And the European Union plotted a new visa strategy to help the bloc fill skills and labor shortages.

Some of these moves were inspired by the tightening of policies in the United States (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump), particularly a new $100,000 fee for incoming H-1B high-skilled workers, the announcement of which caused panic and confusion among current visa holders. Most clearly, in the days after the U.S. change was announced, Canada promised an “accelerated pathway” for some H-1B holders, as part of a C$1.7 billion campaign to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers.

But there were other factors at work, too. The median global population has aged considerably in recent years. As residents especially of high-income countries live longer, they have grown increasingly reliant on the foreign born for care and other work.

Although Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been one of the continent’s leading architects of restrictions on humanitarian immigration (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses), her government this year approved a decree that will allow nearly 500,000 non-EU workers to arrive over the next three years—an increase over the prior three-year period. Spain has been more vocal about its openness towards many immigrants, including Latin Americans who might in other circumstances have gone to the United States. This year Madrid enacted new regulations easing family reunification and access to legal status, among other measures, as part of an approach widely seen as helping to reverse Spain’s population decline and boost the economy. On the other side of the world, in New Zealand, the government made moves to lure digital nomads, create new pathways for skilled workers, and streamline the entry of seasonal workers.

New Zealand also relaxed rules for its Active Investor Plus visa, which offers residence to foreign nationals who make a sizable investment, resulting in a surge of new applications. Vietnam rolled out a similar “golden visa” offering ten years of legal residence to deep-pocketed individuals. And the United States unveiled a “Trump gold card” offering residence to people able to pay a $1 million fee.

In the Caribbean, a new free-movement regime came into effect, allowing nationals of Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to freely live and work in each others’ countries (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). The arrangement was a big step for Caribbean Community (CARICOM) efforts at regional integration, and was at least partially intended to reduce brain drain of highly educated professionals.

For international students, changes in the United States—the top destination for overseas study—further diversified a landscape that had already started to shift. The number of new international students at U.S. higher education institutions dropped 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as it and other traditional destinations—Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom—imposed new barriers. Many students are opting for alternative destinations, including several in East and Southeast Asia, which have sought to capitalize on the trend.

In their approaches to these workers and students, governments that have otherwise seemed immigration averse are seeking to thread the needle. Many are trying to emphasize that their openness to certain immigrants is about selectivity; to maintain a sense of control, they are trying to dictate not just who cannot enter the country, but who can.

Authorities worldwide in 2025 increasingly relied on advanced technologies to surveil, police, and process newly arriving migrants and settled immigrants. In some cases, technology is being used to identify, arrest, and remove noncitizens; in others, the systems are touted as ways to make travel more efficient, frictionless, and safer.

The Trump administration’s expanded deportations effort, for instance (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump), is being powered in part by immigration authorities’ access to a vast array of once off-limits government data, including tax and health-care information. U.S. officials now are using digital tools, many of them artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted, to monitor social media activity, perform facial recognition, track license plates, and scan irises, among other methods. Separately, the U.S. government has contracted with Palantir to build information systems that can identify removable noncitizens and help manage their detention and removal. To further the mission, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed being able to collect biometric data including voice prints, facial imagery, iris scans, and potentially even DNA samples from immigrants of all ages. It has also offered at least one facial recognition tool to state and local authorities.

The United States is by no means alone. Russia in 2025 passed a law requiring some immigrants to use a special mobile app that tracks their location and other data. The United Kingdom began piloting a system that matches faces from a live camera feed to check against a watchlist. The United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries have long relied on digital tools to monitor migrants; in 2025, the Emirates unveiled a new AI-backed system to speed up review of work permits.

Large portions of the European Union’s external borders have increasingly been policed by a network of AI systems, drones, and other high-tech surveillance tools designed to prevent irregular migration. Efforts ramped up, including in the asylum process, in what officials have promised would help reduce the burden on overstretched systems. The bloc also began rolling out a new Entry-Exit System (EES) for many short-term visitors, which swaps traditional passport stamps for biometric screenings. The EES was designed in part to better track foreign nationals and combat visa overstays.

Many of the efforts were criticized by privacy advocates, who fear the consequences of government overreach and warn that surveillance and vetting tools used today against immigrants will eventually be turned on all residents. Border officers in Canada also worried that their government’s embrace of border process automation, which has been ongoing since 2022, could create security gaps.

Still, the innovations pointed to the promise of swifter, faster-moving immigration systems. If successful, the processes could help people obtain protection, legal residence, work permits, and other benefits more quickly.

They also could work in other contexts. Advanced systems to forecast disaster-related displacement, which hit a high in 2024, have been growing in popularity among researchers and aid workers, and could allow both individuals and organizations to better prepare for upcoming disasters.

While many digital tools were used in 2025 to surveil, arrest, and remove people, their potential application could be much broader in the years ahead.

6. Countries in Latin America and Beyond Adjust to U.S. Mass Deportations Campaign

The fallout from the rapid-fire immigration policy changes in the United States was global and often unpredictable. Cooperation on deportation became a precondition for diplomatic engagement with Washington, and multiple countries were left reeling with the consequences of deportations and a stiffer U.S. border.

Patterns of movement through the Americas were particularly shaken up. Crossings of the treacherous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama plummeted precipitously, down from more than 520,000 in 2023 to fewer than 3,000 in the first nine months of 2025. Multiple months saw fewer than a dozen travelers making the trek northward through the jungle. Meanwhile, more than 18,000 migrants—the vast majority of them Venezuelan—had passed through Panama southbound as of September, in a reverse flow.

Large numbers of U.S.-bound individuals were also left stranded in transit, including in Mexico, which had already seen a growing number of migrants decide to put down roots. Asylum requests in Mexico surged in the weeks after the inauguration of Donald Trump; while new arrivals fell off sharply over the year, a much larger share of these migrants sought protection in Mexico than had in years past.

Mexico and northern Central American countries—the origins of most unauthorized immigrants in the United States—also contended with high numbers of returning nationals, and developed new reintegration programs or leaned on pre-existing ones. In many cases, however, returnees struggled all the same. Some reintegration challenges were compounded by the sharp dropoff in global aid funding (see Item 1. Foreign Aid Cuts Cripple Humanitarian Efforts and Raise Prospect of New Displacement). Remittance trends to these countries went in divergent directions, as immigrants in the United States faced the threat of deportation: Financial transfers rose sharply to Central America, where they sometimes account for sizable portions of countries’ economies, but declined to Mexico.

The consequences for running afoul of the Trump administration’s restrictionism could be measured in higher tariffs and loss of diplomatic stature. In January, Colombia’s government refused to accept deportees arriving on U.S. military planes, but ultimately backed down amid a brewing trade war. The threat of steep tariffs similarly seemed to help convince countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and several in Africa to accept U.S. deportees of other nationalities, seemingly resolving Washington’s problem of what to do with nationals of “recalcitrant” countries that refuse to accept their return—though such third-country deportations have been very small to date.

The U.S. pressure was not always successful. In October, Burkina Faso declined to accept third-country deportees, and shortly thereafter the United States halted issuing visas to its citizens. Nigeria similarly refused the offer, around the time that new visa rules tightened Nigerians’ ability to travel to the United States. Mali also announced that visiting U.S. citizens would have to post a $10,000 bond, similar to a measure Washington temporarily imposed on Malians.

Farther afield, tensions between the United States and South Korea escalated following the arrest of more than 300 Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Some individuals detained in the operation were reportedly working legally.

Meanwhile, disputes partially rooted in migration tensions began to slowly remake overarching regional and multilateral forums. The Summit of the Americas was postponed until at least 2026, the United States boycotted the Group of 20 (G20) summit in South Africa, and the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection was effectively abandoned. Combined, the trends suggest that change in Washington was not merely a temporary shift affecting a few countries, but a trigger for a much broader restructuring.

7. Amid a Global Restrictionist Turn, Irregular Migration Drops—But Will It Last?

Border restrictions, including on asylum seeking, appeared to have their desired effect in some countries in 2025, as irregular migration rates declined. The trend, which was not universal, may support the claim that transit and destination countries can deter spontaneous arrivals of asylum seekers and others—but it could also point to deferred migration aims or different patterns of movement, if migrants turn to alternate destinations or simply delay their journey for a period.

The clearest illustration of the trend was along the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw the lowest level of unauthorized arrivals since 1970, amid Trump administration hardening (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump) and a period of increasingly muscular enforcement, including by Mexico.

In the European Union, irregular migration dropped by more than one-fifth through the first ten months of the year and the number of arrivals across the Mediterranean was roughly half that of 2023. Much of the European Union’s efforts involved cooperation with countries in North Africa. For instance, Tunisia, which has promised Europe that “it will not become a transit zone,” had put about 10,000 irregular migrants in a voluntary return program by November, a significant increase over the 7,200 in 2024. The trend was also partly a reflection of the sharp decline in asylum applications from Syrians amid changes in their homeland (see Item 8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?).

To be sure, the trend was not universal. Irregular migration to the United Kingdom grew over 2025 and neared a record as of this writing, even as the Starmer government began implementing a new arrangement with France designed to stop asylum seekers and other migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.

It is far too early to declare border-hardening policies a permanent success. Unauthorized crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border similarly plummeted when Trump first entered office in 2017, but soon thereafter began to rise. As researchers have seen in the past, harsher consequences for irregular migration tend to have the long-term effect of pushing movement further underground and making it more dangerous, potentially empowering cartels and smugglers. And while it may redistribute movement—as seen recently with rising U.S. enforcement prompting some migrants to remain in their transit location or even return to their starting point (see Item 6. Countries in Latin America and Beyond Adjust to U.S. Mass Deportations Campaign)—it is also possible that migrants will head north in the future.

In many cases, recent border restrictions have resulted in large numbers of asylum seekers and other migrants stuck in what had previously been transit countries such as Mexico and Libya. Rights advocates contend that could have serious consequences, for example in Libya, where two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of dozens of migrants were discovered in February.

Humanitarian organizations also worry about the reduced ability for asylum seekers to access protection in countries around the world.

As political leaders in Europe and the United States race to limit border arrivals and expand returns of already present irregular immigrants, they may at some point feel the downstream economic consequences of actions that are not accompanied by expanded legal pathways for in-demand workers. Declining unauthorized immigration could have resulted in as much as a 1 percent reduction in U.S. economic growth in 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates.

8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?

A glimmer of hope emerged in Syria after 14 years of civil war that had spawned perhaps the defining displacement crisis of the 21st century so far, with as many as 7 million Syrians forced from their country and a similar number displaced within it. The late 2024 overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad led to cautious optimism from the international community and prompted millions of Syrians to return to their homes.

By early December, nearly 1.3 million Syrians abroad and another 2 million internally displaced people had returned to their places of origin. Nearly one-fifth of Syrian refugees said in June that they planned to return over the next year, and four-fifths planned to go back eventually.

Neighboring countries, which have experienced strains from years of hosting Syrians, were eager to help facilitate the return movement. Turkey, home to the largest number of displaced Syrians, unveiled a “go-and-see” policy allowing individuals to head to Syria and then return without fear of losing temporary protection, as would have happened previously. Lebanon, which is host to the highest number of refugees per capita globally, helped facilitate the voluntary return of many Syrians, working with UN agencies to organize convoys of buses and trucks to transport them across the border.

The returns were a major driver in the notable decline of displacement globally in 2025, after nearly a decade of consistent growth.

While many Syrians returned by choice, some were forced to go back. Austria in July became the first EU Member State to carry out deportations to Syria since 2011, and other countries planned to follow, as part of a broader shift in norms of humanitarian protection (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses). The United Kingdom and EU countries halted processing asylum applications for Syrians, and the United States sought to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Syrians (although the effort had been blocked by a court as of this writing).

The returns accompanied a general change in international posture towards Syria, which had for many years been a pariah state. International sanctions against the country were lifted over the course of the year, and in September President Ahmed Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian leader to address the UN General Assembly in nearly six decades.

Although these developments marked a dramatic turnaround, steep challenges remain in Syria. Episodes of violence continued well into 2025, and vast swaths of the country depended on humanitarian aid. Nearly 4 million Syrians were registered refugees abroad and another 7 million remained internally displaced. A new era may have dawned in Syria, but it remains in its infancy.

9. With Armed Conflict on the Rise, Crises Endure

Emerging from what was described as the most conflict-heavy year on record, the world in 2025 was beset by protracted crises resulting in mass displacement. More state-based armed conflicts were recorded in 2024 than ever before; while several peace agreements were struck in 2025 and overall displacement declined slightly, more than 117 million people were displaced at midyear (both internationally and within their own countries), the second highest number on record.

Trends were at times multidirectional. Sudan remained the world’s largest displacement crisis, even though the number of internally displaced people shrank from 11.5 million in January to 9.6 million in September. More than 2 million people returned to Khartoum, the civil war-stricken capital, out of a total of 5 million people displaced from the city during the worst fighting. Still, it was too soon for optimism; reported atrocities in Darfur’s el-Fasher, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was accused of committing war crimes, prompted more than 106,000 people to flee in just a handful of weeks

Elsewhere in Africa, ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda signed a peace agreement in June aiming to bring calm to Eastern Congo, where years of clashes between government forces and Rwanda-backed rebels have killed thousands and displaced millions. Yet violence persisted throughout the year, and in September a UN fact-finding mission concluded that all participants have committed serious abuses that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Displacement in West Africa’s Sahel region crept higher, amid violent conflict and natural disasters. As Western forces withdrew and regional collaboration broke down, violent extremist groups seemed to expand into the vacuum (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). Instability was especially pronounced in Mali, where the al Qaeda affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) made rapid gains and prompted “unusual refugee flows” to Côte d'Ivoire.

An unprecedented 1.4 million people were also internally displaced in Haiti, where gang violence has spread rapidly since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Restrictions in nearby countries prevented many Haitians from fleeing internationally, in line with broader tightening of the protection system (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses). The Dominican Republic, the sole country sharing a land border with Haiti, carried out more than 150,000 deportations in the first five months of the year. The United States is the top destination for Haitian migrants; after entering office, the Trump administration canceled a U.S. humanitarian parole program for Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) and also sought to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians, removing deportation protections from several hundred thousand people (a federal court temporarily blocked the termination of TPS).

A fragile ceasefire in Gaza followed efforts by Australia and Canada to offer special humanitarian visas to Palestinians with connections to those countries, although relatively few people were in position to take advantage. The United States went in the opposite direction, halting all visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza amid a backlash from the far right. Gazans have long faced intense challenges in leaving their territory, due to Israeli and Egyptian blockades and the high costs of leaving.

In many cases, conflict-related dangers were exacerbated by environmental catastrophes. For many, the situation only deteriorated over the course of the year, amid a string of typhoons, wildfires, earthquakes, and other events around the globe. Amid a changing climate, steep cuts to foreign aid budgets (see Item 1. Foreign Aid Cuts Cripple Humanitarian Efforts and Raise Prospect of New Displacement) meant many displaced individuals in these situations had little international support to ease their suffering.

10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management

Regional free-movement blocs in Europe and West Africa experienced some struggles in 2025, even as a new regime came into effect in the Caribbean that allows more people to live and work freely across borders. While the practicalities of regional cooperation resulted in mixed results during the year, the concept continues to have broad appeal.

Forty years after coming into being, Europe’s free-movement zone faced intense pressure. Leaders from nearly a dozen European nations imposed some form of internal border controls. Several cited national security or the prospect of heightened irregular migration, and reflected the embrace by some on the continent of far-right political concerns. Germany, which has been at the forefront of stiffening borders within the 29-member Schengen Zone, introduced new rules in May and had turned away nearly 18,600 people by November.

The European Union also faced internal tensions as it moved ahead with implementing the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. After a month-long delay, the European Commission in November announced which Member States will be eligible to receive financial and other support to handle asylum pressures, and which will be exempted from providing support. The solidarity pool, as the mechanism is known, was criticized from some corners and could point to new fractures in the future.

All the same, membership in the bloc and free movement between Member States proved to be as attractive as ever. Bulgaria and Romania formally entered the Schengen Zone on January 1, an EU-UK deal will bring down the border between Gibraltar (a British Overseas Territory) and Spain, and Cyprus (which is already an EU Member State) set a goal of fully joining Schengen in 2026. While complete consensus on Europe’s migration challenges seemed unattainable, integration had at least a continued allure.

The future looked slightly less bright in West Africa’s Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formally left in January. The three countries are led by juntas that took power in a series of coups since 2021, and have seen worsening displacement and humanitarian situations in the years since (see Item 9. With Armed Conflict on the Rise, Crises Endure). The “Sahelexit” was a blow to regional collaboration, including on migration, and ushered in a series of ad hoc bilateral efforts on issues such as cross-border infrastructure projects and security.

Meanwhile, regional collaboration was on the rise in the Caribbean. Starting in October, nationals of Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have been able to freely live, work, and access public services such as education and health care in each other’s countries. The arrangement was a big step forward for efforts by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to achieve regional integration; it complements a free-movement system in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) that has been operational since 2011. Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are OECS members; Barbados and Belize are not.",https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_images/topten-2025-main.png,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:30.141913

Tense standoff

The backstory:

There were some tense moments on Saturday morning as dozens of protesters confronted federal agents in Chanhassen.

The incident became heated in bitter cold temperatures as two men stayed on top of a roof under construction for hours to avoid being taken in by federal officers.

DHS said ICE officers were conducting an operation to arrest Marco Chicaiza Dutan.

One in custody

What they're saying:

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Marco is in the country illegally and has a criminal record.

According to court documents, Marco had previously been convicted in a case for disorderly conduct.

""During the operation, two suspects fled from a vehicle and entered a construction site, climbing onto a roof to evade arrest,"" said McLaughlin about Saturday’s operation.

Federal officials said the other man, Edgar Chicaiza Dutan, did come down and was taken away in an ambulance and checked out due to exposure to the cold weather. He has since been released to ICE.

ICE has said Edgar entered the U.S. illegally in 2019.

What's next:

On 19 May, McIver was charged with interfering with an arrest outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey earlier that month.
The administration included McIver on a list of supposed “antifa violence”, alongside people charged for bomb threats and violent attacks on federal agents and facilities.
Members of Congress have oversight abilities at ICE facilities, allowing them to visit without notice – though the Trump administration has attempted to limit these visits.
Democratic lawmakers filed a lawsuit earlier this year to force the Trump administration to follow the law on oversight visits and allow them unfettered access.","This year marked the start of LaMonica McIver’s first full term as a member of Congress. Rather than a year spent learning the ropes of her new job, the New Jersey Democrat spent much of it fighting against federal criminal charges she sees as political retribution.

On 19 May, McIver was charged with interfering with an arrest outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey earlier that month.

“This is about intimidation. It’s about bullying,” McIver told the Guardian. “It’s about trying to stop our level of government from having oversight and holding this administration accountable.”

The charges weren’t about her, “a little Black girl from the city of Newark”, she said, later referencing Donald Trump: “It was about using me as an example. … He hoped that what he’s doing to me, using me as an example, that it would scare other members of Congress from doing their job, from having oversight.”

Trump’s campaign of retribution against his political enemies and the left writ large has proven a key feature of his second term. He has sought to charge Democratic officials despite pushback from prosecutors. He has filed executive orders that attack specific people and organizations based on his grievances. He has cast a host of activity as related to “antifa” as a way to hinder leftwing organizing. The administration included McIver on a list of supposed “antifa violence”, alongside people charged for bomb threats and violent attacks on federal agents and facilities.

The legal turmoil stemmed from a 9 May visit to Delaney Hall, a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. McIver, alongside other elected officials, went to conduct an inspection as part of her congressional duties. Members of Congress have oversight abilities at ICE facilities, allowing them to visit without notice – though the Trump administration has attempted to limit these visits.

During these visits, Democratic members of Congress have often found unsafe, unsanitary and substandard conditions and have met with constituents as part of their advocacy for their immigration cases. Democratic lawmakers filed a lawsuit earlier this year to force the Trump administration to follow the law on oversight visits and allow them unfettered access.

At Delaney Hall, the Newark mayor, Ras Baraka, was asked to leave because he is not a member of Congress and was arrested for trespassing. Charging documents noted that people, including members of Congress, surrounded Baraka to create a “human shield” to prevent his arrest and alleged that McIver shouted “hell no” repeatedly. Video of part of the incident shows a chaotic scene, with protesters, elected officials and agents in a scrum.

The Washington Post, after analyzing video from many angles, said McIver “made contact with at least two agents” in the scuffle, but that it was “difficult to discern the force of the contact and to what extent it was intentional or the result of the chaotic moment”.

Charges against Baraka were dropped 10 days later. But McIver was subsequently charged for assaulting, impeding and interfering with an arrest – charges that collectively could carry up to 17 years in prison. She was formally indicted by a grand jury in June. Alina Habba, who was serving as acting US attorney for the state at the time, pursued the charges. She has since resigned her role after a court found her ineligible to hold the job without confirmation.

“At the end of the day, ICE and homeland security, they created the chaos there, and that’s evident as they arrested the mayor, charged him, and then dropped the charges,” McIver said.

McIver was not at Delaney Hall to protest, she said – she was there to do her job. Delaney Hall is in her district. She serves on the homeland security committee. She had a duty as a member of Congress.

She has asked for investigations into the facility and for it to be shut down. The month after her oversight visit, four detainees escaped the facility after reportedly kicking through an interior wall. The Republicans who run the House oversight committee haven’t investigated, she said.

“I’ve seen, in my community, moms afraid to pick up their kids, people afraid to go to the doctor,” she said. “They’re terrorizing people on the street based off the color of their skin, racially profiling. I mean, we cannot allow ICE to operate in the dark.”

McIver has pleaded not guilty and fought to get the charges dismissed, arguing that she was fulfilling her duties as a member of Congress and that she was being selectively prosecuted, noting the president’s pardons of those charged and convicted for their roles in the January 6 insurrection under the same statutes under which she was charged.

A judge denied the motion to dismiss on two of the counts, writing that she had “not demonstrated that her prosecution is a result of personal animus harbored by the prosecution”. A ruling on whether the assault charge should be dismissed is expected soon. A trial date has not yet been set.

After the charges were filed, Trump said he didn’t know who McIver was, but that “the days of woke are over”.

“That woman was out of control,” he said of McIver. “She was shoving federal agents. She was out of control. The days of that crap are over in this country. We’re going to have law and order.”

McIver, 39, was first elected in a special election in New Jersey’s 10th congressional district in September 2024 following the death of Donald Payne Jr. She won a full term two months later. Before Congress, she served for several years in local elected roles. She was an immediate, outspoken critic to Trump after he was sworn in for his second term.

The case has been time-consuming, distracting and expensive. She’s had to pay a million dollars for representation in the case, raising funds for legal assistance because she can’t accept pro bono help because of ethics rules (despite the administration “using your money and tax dollars to prosecute me”). Some Republicans, led by Nancy Mace, sought to expel her after the charges were filed.

The stress of a potential 17 years in prison weighs on her personally as well. She has a nine-year-old child, a spouse, a mother “who’s worried to death about what this administration will do to her daughter”.

“It actually breaks my heart that this is the country that we’re living in with this president who, quite honestly, is cruel and doesn’t give a damn,” she said.

Ankush Khardori, a Politico writer and former federal prosecutor, wrote that the government’s case was “likely to be a dud”.

“The charges certainly appear to many as both politically motivated and, at a bare minimum, unwarranted as a matter of appropriate prosecutorial discretion,” Khardori wrote.

McIver sees the case against her as another example of Trump’s fear-based agenda, a way to make people frightened and thus unwilling to fight back. But her district elected her to protect them, and she’s going to continue doing so, she said.

“Sometimes that comes with a sacrifice, a personal sacrifice, which is what I’m going through right now, and I think my constituents want to continue to see me make personal sacrifices to protect them against a very dangerous president and administration,” she said.

She has faith in the legal system, but said she’s “taking one day at a time” on fighting the charges. “This is a new situation for me. I’m not a known criminal. This is not something that was in my trajectory.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91669f9f03ad4808d0a92be73e3d156cd8b5238a/327_0_3346_2675/master/3346.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=204be444e1b05d0588c019e3e5482d43",N,,2025-12-17 10:57:31.032320

Medical Neglect at ICE Detention Center While he was detained in a different California immigration detention center in 2024, Viera Reyes was in agonizing pain, and had blood in his urine and stool.
Detention administrators failed to get him that biopsy before he was transferred to California City Detention Facility, the largest immigration detention center in the state, in August 2025.
ICE also did not send his health care records with him when he was transferred from another ICE facility to California City, further delaying his treatment.
Viera Reyes had heard that the man left a note that said he would rather die in America than be deported.","When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Fernando Viera Reyes, his first concern was deportation. His second: prostate cancer.

“It’s one thing being healthy and going through that, but now there’s no medical attention,” Viera Reyes said. “I talked to guys who had been in detention. One guy said you’re not going to make it. You’re going to suffer.”

Viera Reyes is among seven people detained by ICE who sued the Trump administration on November 12 over inhumane conditions at the privately owned California City Detention Facility. The plaintiffs filed their lawsuit with the support of the ACLU, California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, Prison Law Office, and Keker Van Nest & Peters as a class action representing all people detained at California City. They cite punishing conditions, enforced isolation, neglect of people with disabilities, denial of access to counsel, and, as in Viera Reyes’ case, the facility’s terrifyingly inadequate medical care. ICE’s neglect of Viera Reyes’s medical condition is so severe that he filed an emergency motion.

Medical Neglect at ICE Detention Center

While he was detained in a different California immigration detention center in 2024, Viera Reyes was in agonizing pain, and had blood in his urine and stool. He underwent multiple tests that showed signs of prostate cancer. Viera Reyes has since been in an endless limbo of trying to get a final test: a biopsy to diagnose the cancer, so he can receive prompt treatment.

Detention administrators failed to get him that biopsy before he was transferred to California City Detention Facility, the largest immigration detention center in the state, in August 2025. Since his transfer, Viera Reyes’ barriers to treatment and painful uncertainty regarding his health have worsened. Not only has ICE thwarted his attempts to get a biopsy, Viera Reyes also cannot access the medication he needs to manage symptoms. He has had difficulty seeing a doctor, let alone a specialist. ICE also did not send his health care records with him when he was transferred from another ICE facility to California City, further delaying his treatment. At this point, he has reason to believe his cancer has spread.

Since Viera Reyes arrived at California City, his health has gotten worse. He stays in bed more than he used to. It’s difficult for him to use the bathroom without feeling pain and discomfort, especially without medication. Lately, a pulsating feeling has intensified.

“I was in prison for over 30 years,” Viera Reyes said. “The conditions at California City are worse.”

At least in prison there were fewer barriers to access medical care than he has faced in ICE detention. He was also able to work out, participate in classes and go to church. Now, all he can do to distract himself is watch television. “I always worry. My mind right now is racing,” he said. “We’re just stuck and the only thing that works a lot is our mind, the anxiety.”

Because the levels in his blood work that indicate illness are escalating, Viera Reyes has advocated constantly for his own wellbeing by putting in multiple emergency requests to see a urologist, but his requests have been ignored. When he reported the pain he was experiencing and asked for medication, the doctor prescribed him Vitamin C. Others told him to buy Tylenol from the commissary.

ICE Detention Center Violates Immigrant Rights and Basic Needs

Despite the egregious medical neglect Viera Reyes is experiencing, his story is just one among the hundreds of people detained at California City. Led by the people detained, the lawsuit unveils the myriad ways that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security fail to accommodate basic human needs for the people in their care.Fernando Gomez Ruiz, another person who is suing ICE alongside Viera Reyes, was repeatedly denied insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. He also has an ulcer on his foot that he was not getting proper treatment for. Another plaintiff, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, could not get his heart medications, even though he had two emergency room visits as soon as he arrived at the facility. The emergency room doctor told the facility that he urgently needed to see a cardiac specialist within 72 hours. He is still waiting for that specialist appointment three months later.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit also cite excessively restrictive and punitive conditions. For example, Gustavo Guevara Alarcon was placed in solitary confinement for asking to finish his shower.

“Sometimes it feels like they’re treating us like prisoners, but we’re not,” Viera Reyes said. “It’s like they want us to act like prisoners. They want us to be hostile, even for medical reasons, banging on the door and yelling.”

In addition to the severely broken medical system at California City, people with disabilities are denied basic accommodations, such as sign language interpreters and wheelchairs. One plaintiff in the lawsuit who is Deaf and only speaks in American Sign Language, Jose Ruiz Canizales, has only interacted with a sign language interpreter by the facility once, via video. It’s made him feel completely isolated. When he tried to communicate with staff, they would often shrug their shoulders, walk away, or laugh at him.

“So often what happens in a detention facility behind locked doors and barbed wire is invisible to the public,” said Kyle Virgien, senior staff attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project. “It's really important that people know what's being done by our government in our name.”

Detained People Describe Punitive Treatment and Harsh Conditions

The facility holds people in small concrete cells the size of a parking space for hours on end without adequate clothing, food, or water. They deny people basic medical care, disability accommodations, and access to their lawyers and loved ones. Sewage bubbles up from the shower drains, and insects crawl up and down the walls of the cells in the decrepit facility. Officers threaten people who speak out against the abusive conditions with violence and solitary confinement, which they use excessively. Temperatures are frigid. Some wear socks on their arms as sleeves to stay warm.

California City previously operated as a state prison in the middle of the Mojave Desert managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ICE contracted with the for-profit company CoreCivic to re-open the prison as an immigration detention center this year. It can hold up to 2,560 immigrants in the facility. Since its re-opening, it has come under intense criticism, with people detained at California City describing the facility as a “torture chamber,” and community members expressing outrage over its deplorable conditions. Detained people also have engaged in numerous sit-ins and hunger strikes, including in mid-September, when over 100 people across several housing pods engaged in collective action to demand an end to many of the abuses the lawsuit challenges.

“It's important to remember we lawyers have the freedom to bring this lawsuit without facing many personal consequences,” Virgien said. “But for the people on the inside, they are standing up against the government while they are under complete control of the government. So the fact that they're willing to stand up even though they might face retaliation or harm is just truly impressive. I'm so honored to be able to fight alongside them.”

Immigrants Detained Struggle to Maintain Hope in the Face of Deportation and Mistreatment

While some have been empowered to fight back, pervasive fear and suffering have driven others to abandon their legal rights and agree to deportation.

One man at California City attempted suicide by hanging. He remains anonymous in the lawsuit. Another plaintiff, Sokhean Keo, who was friends with that man, saw his body hanging in the cell. The man survived and was transported to receive medical care. California City staff did not offer mental-health services to the people who had witnessed his suicide attempt. Instead, staff disciplined anyone who had not returned to their cells after the incident, people who remain haunted by the image of their friend’s body hanging in his cell.

Viera Reyes had heard that the man left a note that said he would rather die in America than be deported. “It triggered something in my mind like, ‘Wow, he has a point.’ I put myself in his shoes, because I know what’s going to happen to me if I get deported. But you start thinking about your family.”

At least two other detained people have attempted suicide, and others believe the number is higher. The desolation and desperation has rattled Viera Reyes. He said he tells other detained people in the facility: “Faith is going to have to be your base. Stand on that and believe that something is going to change,” he said. “I know I’m going through pain and I know they’re not doing what they’re supposed to do, but we have to have determination.”",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/ACLU_CADetention_Web_s.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:58:09.514007

Then jail staff intervened,Stephanie Zappelli,,,,,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article313733507.html,"The ICE agents stood near the large, blue jail release door, which separates the jail from the lobby, Del told The Tribune.
If a person of color walks out of the jail, ICE pounces on them, she said.
When the jail door opened, the protesters yelled, “La migra está aquí,” or “ICE is here,” to warn the inmate.
Two of the suspected ICE agents immediately entered the secure portion of the jail where the inmate was standing.
Eventually, the suspected ICE agents left the jail, according to CJ, Del and Sue.","Suspected U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents rushed into a secure portion of the San Luis Obispo County Jail to grab an inmate on Sunday — and jail staff intervened, witnesses say.

While about 40 protesters with the nonprofit organization Indivisible gathered at the corner of Highway 1 and Kansas Avenue at 9 a.m. to protest ICE, three familiar vehicles drove into the jail parking lot.

805 UndocuFund volunteers have seen those vehicles on the scene of ICE operations and entering and exiting the Santa Maria ICE Facility, volunteers told The Tribune. ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the incident.

According to protesters at the scene, four men exited the vehicles wearing face masks, sunglasses and vests that said “police.” They filed into the jail lobby at 9:15 a.m. alongside a handful of protesters and 805 UndocuFund rapid responders.

A protester named Del and a rapid responder named CJ said they both entered the lobby with the ICE agents. Del and CJ declined to share their last names with The Tribune for fear of retaliation.

The ICE agents stood near the large, blue jail release door, which separates the jail from the lobby, Del told The Tribune.

Del said she heard the door “click” and prepared for an inmate to step out.

“Whenever that blue door is about to open, and we’re unsure of who’s coming out of that door — a brown person or a white person — that’s when it escalates,” she said.

Del said she’s watched ICE agents treat white people differently than people of color. If a white person walks out of the jail, the officers move aside to let them pass. If a person of color walks out of the jail, ICE pounces on them, she said.

When the jail door opened, the protesters yelled, “La migra está aquí,” or “ICE is here,” to warn the inmate.

Then, the man stepped into the lobby, and the officers handcuffed him without presenting a warrant or identifying themselves, Del said. The officers then escorted him to a vehicle in the parking lot and closed the door, she said.

CJ echoed Del’s statements.

“It’s heartbreaking,” Del told The Tribune. “It feels cruel. It makes me angry that we allow this to happen without due process, without being shown a warrant, right under the noses of the sheriff in a public space.”

Suspected ICE agent pushes protester

Three of the officers then returned to the lobby, where about 20 protesters from Indivisible and 805 UndocuFund had since gathered, witnesses told The Tribune.

Tension escalated in the room as the officers and activists argued with each other, Indivisible protester Sue M. said. She declined to share her full last name for fear of retaliation.

Sue and CJ said they positioned themselves near the jail release door with signs that said, “ICE está en la carcel,” which means, “ICE is in the jail.” The sign also included 805 UndocuFund’s rapid response hotline number, 805-870-8855.

The pair said they planned to flash their signs at the inmate before he entered the lobby as a warning.

The officers then told Sue to move away from the door if it opened, and she said she told them she would. She heard the inner door click and prepared to walk away, but two officers grabbed her arms and another pushed her on the back — causing her to stumble forward, she said.

CJ said the officers then ordered her out of the way, and she said, “Yes, I’m moving,” and started walking away. Then one of the officers pushed her, she said.

“He’s got guns, pepper spray, taser, baton — and I’m a 4-foot-11 girl,” CJ said. “I don’t know why he feels the need to do that.”

Then, a white man walked out of the jail release door. The officers stepped aside so he could walk out of the lobby, according to CJ, Del and Sue. This happened twice, they said.

The inner door “clicked” once again at about 10:30 a.m., and the protesters yelled “ICE está aqui” as the door opened, a video showed.

805 UndocuFund shared the video with The Tribune to corroborate the story, but The Tribune will not publish the video to protect the identity of the inmate.

Two of the suspected ICE agents immediately entered the secure portion of the jail where the inmate was standing. The inmate, who wasn’t white, started walking backwards, then the agents grabbed him and pressed him against the wall, the video showed.

Then, jail staff placed themselves between the officers and the inmate.

The officers returned to the lobby, and jail staff closed the blue door without the man leaving the jail.

Eventually, the suspected ICE agents left the jail, according to CJ, Del and Sue.

The Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident, agency spokesperson Tony Cipolla said on Tuesday.

“Our understanding is that there was a confrontation between protesters and ICE agents in the lobby and we are investigating to see what occurred,” he said in a statement. “At this time, we don’t have any further comment until we receive more information on the incident.”",https://www.sanluisobispo.com/public/latest-news/p4ippx/picture313758540/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ICE%20jail%20lobby.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:34.206773

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a ""clear defeat"" for Paxton.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and in October appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

Paxton had called the program ""evil and wicked,"" as well as unconstitutional. On Tuesday, a judge disagreed, declining to block the program.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a ""clear defeat"" for Paxton.

""The court saw this lawsuit for exactly what it was: a cheap political stunt designed to score headlines,"" Menefee said. ""Harris County will not be intimidated or pushed around by state officials who are more interested in pandering than governing.""

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

""When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don't have an attorney, they're deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,"" Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs ""serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.""

He asked the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: After Tuesday's ruling, Menefee accused Paxton of cherry-picking facts about the program and ignoring its ""clear public purpose.""

""These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,"" Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said. ""Making sure they can resolve their immigration status strengthens our economy, keeps families together, and makes our community safer.""

In a statement, Menefee and members of the Harris County Commissioners' Court accused Paxton of using this program to bolster his conservative credentials during a heated primary for U.S. Senate.

""Providing legal support to immigrants who are trying to ‘do it the right way' was never a concern to the Attorney General's Office,"" Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. ""That is, until Ken Paxton decided to run for higher office.""

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

""Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,"" he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. ""In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/17081824/PersonInHandcuffsWithFolder-T-1500x991.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:39.260118

Maybe he wants to stop at creating a category of second-class citizens among asylum seekers — though this also undermines the point of universal human rights.
There is an obvious irony in Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, leading a global charge to weaken human rights.
Amending the ECHR will hardly revolutionize British migration policy, as the Law Society points out.","“What Europe is doing with immigration is a disaster,” US president Donald Trump told Politico’s Dasha Burns in an incendiary interview published on December 9. “They’re decaying. They’re destroying their countries.”

Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, agrees. As Trump’s newest broadside rocked Europe, Starmer and Danish premier Mette Frederiksen launched an intervention in the Guardian, calling for sweeping changes to the established European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to speed up deportation rates. Both nominally on the center left of politics, they are leading a cross-European bid to push the Council of Europe, which oversees the ECHR, to make these changes.

Unity between British centrists and US conservatives in undermining international laws and norms is nothing new. We’d seen it already during the global “war on terror” or the Gaza genocide. On both sides of the Atlantic, governments have long dropped the pretense of abiding moral and legal norms on migration.

The pace of this shift is nevertheless surprising. Until recently, calls to amend or drop the ECHR had been confined to right-wing hard-liners. Now Starmer has taken them mainstream. He frames this as a response to ordinary people’s concerns. It seems doubtful that amid a crippling cost-of-living crisis, such European jurisprudence is dominating many people’s kitchen-table discussions.

Look closer and the substance of the argument gets odder. If one believes Britain’s hysterical tabloid press, the ECHR is a cudgel wielded by activist lawyers to frustrate any attempt to deport even the most violent foreign criminals. In August, a national furor broke out over a claim that an offender could not be deported because of his son’s human right to eat his favorite brand of chicken nuggets, only available on British shelves.

Nuggetgate was not true, and neither was the narrative behind it. Less than one in every hundred foreign-national convicts succeeds in appealing a deportation decision. Around one in sixty cases of people who claim that their rights under the ECHR have been violated have anything to do with immigration. In the last forty-five years, the ECHR has ruled against the British state in only thirteen immigration removal cases. The country’s immigration rules have been found in violation of the ECHR on just three occasions.

The ECHR does provide some protections used in immigration cases. But that’s not why conservatives hate it. It is just the latest target for their standard playbook. The attack on a minority (in this case asylum seekers) provides an excuse to roll back everyone’s legal protections.

British right-wingers cast the ECHR as a tool of elites, but they hate it for its intermittent ability to restrain elite power. Rulings have helped workers avoid being penalized for joining unions, restrained police forces from using mass surveillance, and taken steps toward leveling the playing field between large corporations and ordinary claimants in court.

It’s unsurprising that the Right works to undermine human rights. A more interesting question is: What’s in it for the Labour Party?

A New Era

“The current asylum framework was created for another era,” opens Starmer and Frederiksen’s article. “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work.”

The context surely has changed — albeit in the opposite way to what these narrators imply. When the Refugee Convention and ECHR were written, up to sixty-five million people had been displaced across Europe after World War II. Today’s total is barely a sixth of that, with the largest group being those displaced from Ukraine in 2022. While contemporary Europe certainly has its problems, most of its major cities are no longer smoldering piles of rubble.

This deeply misleading start sets the tone for Starmer and Frederiksen’s loose relationship with facts and coherence throughout. The point of their intervention is to announce proposals to the ECHR, but they don’t deign to mention this until the final paragraphs.

While claiming they want to focus on faster removals of foreign criminals, they also point to a desire to make life harder for refugees across the board. Their first proposed change is intended to prevent migrants from reuniting with their families in Britain, through a reinterpretation of the meaning of a right to a family life.

The second thing Starmer and his allies find objectionable is how the ECHR’s judges have interpreted the right to freedom from torture in migration cases. This precedent is rooted in a 1988 ruling (not a migration case), which prevented a murder suspect from being extradited to the United States due to that country’s use of the death penalty.

It is unclear whether Starmer wants weaker definitions of freedom from torture and family life rights for everyone. Maybe he wants to stop at creating a category of second-class citizens among asylum seekers — though this also undermines the point of universal human rights. In practice, the point regarding torture seems likely related to Europe’s current major push to deport more people to Afghanistan, even under Taliban rule.

Authoritarians

Starmer is working with Frederiksen for a reason. Denmark is perhaps the sole example of a European country where Social Democrats have introduced harsh migration policy in office and retained power. In other countries, such concessions to right-wing claims have been rewarded by electoral defeat.

Denmark is a small, relatively tight-knit country with little imperial history, low migration levels, and higher wealth equality. For these reasons and more, conditions there do not map well onto Britain. And even in Denmark, the Social Democrats’ drift rightward was recently a key factor in their losing the capital city of Copenhagen for the first time in a century to the Left.

The surface-level politics of the ECHR move are about panicked Labour strategists inventing incoherent schemes to neutralize the meteoric rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. But this is not all that’s going on.

Internationally, Starmer’s Britain is attempting to position itself at the helm of a new multilateral regime of transnational policing, globalized migration controls, and rearmament, replacing the liberal universalism of structures like the ECHR with cross-border authoritarianism.

This is mirrored by Labour’s striking descent into authoritarian domestic policy, even relative to its Conservative predecessor.

The most notable example is the declaration of protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, a move extreme enough to be decried even by a former Royal Air Force officer once charged with securing nuclear bases against mass protests.

The Palestine Action ban and harsh treatment of climate protesters can also be somewhat read as appeasement of Britain’s right. But the same does not apply to Labour’s deeply unpopular proposals to introduce compulsory digital ID, which is moving ahead despite a backlash across the political spectrum. The Right also has its own account of the civil liberties critique, mainly in opposition to draconian sentences for incendiary social media posts. In short, no one is buying what Starmer is selling.

It is Labour, not the Right, that is currently using claims of crime, domestic extremism, and migration crisis to roll back civil liberties at scale.

To do so, they are diverting already strained public resources into this authoritarian project. Controversial US tech and weapons firm Anduril has been brought in to blanket the South Coast in high-tech watchtowers, as part of billions in funding set aside for controlling Channel migration. The close access to government and public services enjoyed by Palantir and other Big Tech actors is facing increasing scrutiny. So too is Britain’s association with violent border controls overseas and arms exports to wars of aggression.

In the context of this wider authoritarian drive, the rationale behind undermining frameworks like the ECHR, which provide checks on state power, becomes clearer.

Mr Rules?

There is an obvious irony in Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, leading a global charge to weaken human rights. There are also precedents for Starmer’s authoritarian shift in office, including his push when he was Britain’s prosecutions chief for harsh sentences over relatively low-level offences.

His team has squared these contradictions by portraying him as “Mr Rules,” a technocrat who is passionate about ensuring things are done properly, which may result in different outcomes at different times.

But the ECHR move, and the wider shift it symbolizes, is not upholding a rules-based order so much as dismantling it.

Like the Palestine Action ban, or the various ill-considered changes to asylum rules, the attempt to reinterpret the ECHR creates a more chaotic, less rule-bound system that is more amenable to abuses of power. Its underlying logic, by which politicians not only draft laws but dictate their interpretation by the courts, has dangerous implications.

It’s hardly just activist lawyers sounding the alarm. Even the House of Lords’ Constitution Committee now thinks that the rule of law is under threat.

Amending the ECHR will hardly revolutionize British migration policy, as the Law Society points out. ECHR members including Greece, Turkey, Poland, and Italy have managed to commit or sponsor extreme and large-scale human rights violations against people migrating while hanging on to their membership cards. But it sends a powerful signal that even apparently established norms can now be rewritten.

Britain’s political class is painfully aware of a vacuum of public trust in politics and eroded popular consent for their rule. In Britain and across Europe, the center’s twofold response has been ideological concessions to the radical right, while building their own machinery to manage crisis by controlling dissent.

Labour’s case to its supporters is that they should give it room to maneuver, because while it might make people uncomfortable, the alternative is Reform. The approach doesn’t work, but the argument also misses the point.

Reform UK would be far more aggressive in reshaping society for the worse. By normalizing its talking points and creating new legal infrastructure for it to use, Starmer is simply clearing the road for reaction. It’s making his opponents’ lives easier.

A letter sent Tuesday from Democratic U.S. Senator Patty Murray’s office to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons lays out mounting concerns about access to legal counsel and medical care, and raises questions about whether staffing at the detention center is adequate.

The letter cites reports from local service providers and advocates with access to the facility, including reports of at least three pregnant women in detention who claim they have not been able to receive appropriate medical care. It also references two suicide attempts in April and challenges for detainees to access behavioral care.

“None of this is remotely acceptable — you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care,” the letter states.

The letter demands increased oversight and “immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at [the detention center] to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.”

“Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged,” the letter states, referencing national detention standards that set guidelines for the facility.

Democratic U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell also signed the letter, along with seven Democratic U.S. Representatives from Washington: Emily Randall, Pramila Jayapal, Kim Schrier, Suzan DelBene, Adam Smith, Rick Larsen, and Marilyn Strickland.

12/16/25 letter from Sen. Patty Murray and WA Congress members to ICE regarding conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

Questions about staffing levels at the facility have persisted this year as ICE arrests increased and the Tacoma detention center filled to capacity. ICE makes some detention statistics publicly available but it doesn’t provide an ongoing headcount of detainees at each facility. Several academic researchers, however, do track headcount through ongoing public records requests.

Records show the daily headcount at the Tacoma facility nearly doubled during President Trump’s first six months in office, and at times this summer appeared to surpass the facility’s capacity of 1,575 beds, according to government data provided by ICE, processed by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

The latest available data shows a headcount of 1,427 people held at the Tacoma facility on Oct. 16.

Detainees have engaged in hunger strikes over the years to protest living conditions at the facility, and recently more detainees and advocates are pointing to a staffing shortage as an exacerbating issue.

“I talked to a lot of the guards there and they all would tell me that they were very short [staffed], and so that's why our food or the medical attention was never on time for folks,” Alfredo Juarez Zeferino told KUOW in July, after spending four months in the Tacoma detention center before deciding to give up his legal fight and return to Mexico.

“If we're sick and we need to see a doctor, we have to wait for a whole day or multiple days before we can go see a doctor,” Juarez said.

Juarez, a well-known farm labor organizer in Washington’s Skagit Valley, was detained by ICE in March due to a traffic stop in his teens, which briefly landed him in ICE custody and with a deportation order he said he never knew about until immigration agents arrived this year to enforce it.

“If we can get answers back from this [letter], then we can use that information to require them to put more, let's say, medical doctors or healthcare doctors at the facility, to improve the food service,” Murray said Tuesday in an interview with KUOW.

The Congress members’ letter also highlights concerns about access to legal counsel.

Sponsored

“Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult,” the letter states. “At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The facility has typically allocated seven rooms for attorneys to privately meet with clients, but some of these rooms are now being used for virtual attorney meetings or video hearings.

“We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms, ” the letter states.

Elizabeth Benki, a directing attorney with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, told KUOW these recent obstacles and slowdowns at the detention center have affected her organization’s ability to take on as many cases as it normally would.

“Each case is just more time-consuming,” she said. “It requires so many more hours and each case can be so much more unpredictable. It would be the outlier if you had to wait in the past to meet with a client, whereas now it's more the standard.”

Sponsored

The letter also calls for ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety, as the issue of detainees getting released on bond continues to be a hurdle.

Recent court rulings struck down a Trump administration policy to deny bond to a broad category of people who previously were eligible, including people with no criminal history. Still, Benki said judges in Tacoma are not following that order, requiring attorneys to petition in federal court to get detainees released on bond.

“We anticipated that the Tacoma judges would follow that order but they have not been, so we've been forced to file these enforcement actions,” Benki said. Those extra court filings also cut into the time attorneys would otherwise spend on additional cases at the detention center, she added.

“It's never been this tough,” Benki said. “It’s pretty devastating, the year that our staff have had…having really huge hurdles put in front of us.”

Tuesday’s letter gives ICE a Jan. 16 deadline to answer several questions about staffing levels, detainee headcount, medical and legal services, and other human rights concerns at the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

In recent months, KUOW has also made multiple, similar information requests to ICE and GEO Group, the private contractor that operates the Tacoma facility. ICE has not provided answers, and in response to KUOW’s questions this week about staffing levels and various policies raised in the letter, an ICE spokesperson recommended “a FOIA request to get personal information on a detainee.”

Murray said she will continue to track these ongoing concerns at the detention center and use her oversight position on the Senate Appropriations Committee to hold ICE accountable.

“We can enforce our immigration laws in a humane way,” Murray said. “It seems to me that what the Trump administration is doing is using cruelty as immigration enforcement and that, to me, is unacceptable.”

“Newsom’s online campaign mocking Trump has clearly been part of his rise in popularity with base Democrat voters,” Stuzman said.
Most recently, Trump unveiled a website of “media offenders,” naming journalists and outlets he accuses of bias.
Newsom’s office pushed back on the comparison, saying the journalists targeted by Trump were accused of bias rather than criminal conduct, unlike those listed on the California site.
The state’s website launch comes as Newsom seeks to cast California as a national leader in responsible governance of artificial intelligence.","Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a new state-run website Tuesday that tracks what his office calls the “criminal cronies” around President Trump — just the latest trolling tactic by the California governor that directly mirrors Trump’s own use of public resources for political score settling.

Newsom pegged the website’s rollout to recent crime statistics, which were released in early November showing falling rates of homicide and assault in California. The governor’s website catalogs what it calls the top 10 criminal convictions that were followed by pardons offered thus far by Trump — from Jan. 6 rioters to former politicians and business figures convicted of fraud, drug trafficking and financial crimes. The website calls Trump the “criminal in chief.”

The website features AI-generated portraits of such figues as Rod Blagojevich, the only Illinois governor to be impeached and removed from office; former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking; and Ross Ulbricht, the founder of a dark-web drug marketplace who had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The images show the men standing in a lineup with the word “felon” stamped in red ink.

“With crime dropping — again — California is proving what real public safety leadership looks like,” read a statement from Newsom. “Meanwhile in D.C., Trump is a felon who surrounds himself with scammers and drug traffickers. We’re providing the public with a resource putting the facts in one place so Californians, and all Americans, can see who he elevates and who he protects.”

The launch is the latest escalation in Newsom’s increasingly aggressive digital campaign against Trump. In recent months, the governor and his press office have turned social media into a near-daily forum for mocking and trolling the president by firing off all-caps posts, meme-style graphics and sharply worded rebukes aimed at Trump’s brash rhetoric, criminal record, policy proposals and political allies.

Republican strategist Rob Stutzman, who is openly critical of Trump, said Newsom’s latest tactic may be moving past parody and instead “perpetuating the Trump denigration” of societal norms and public confidence in institutions.

“Newsom’s online campaign mocking Trump has clearly been part of his rise in popularity with base Democrat voters,” Stuzman said. “But by doing so from a taxpayer financed website with state employees, he is agreeing to disregard previous norms for public institutions that Trump has dismantled. Be careful to not become that which you despise.”

Others, including Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump political action committee known as the Lincoln Project, said Newsom’s mirroring can’t go too far when it’s simply showing what the president is doing himself. Madrid called Newsom’s approach “fantastic.”

“He’s turning the tables completely on Trump. Completely,” Madrid said. “The more Trump attacks him, the more Trump’s enablers attack him, the stronger he’s gonna get ... Do I like the fact that taxpayer dollars are being used this way? No, but that train left the station on January 2017 when Trump took office the first time.”

The crime data, which were released Nov. 3 by the Major Cities Chiefs Assn., found homicides across California’s major cities fell 18% year over year, robberies dropped 18% and aggravated assaults declined 9%. The association also found that violent crime decreased in every California city reporting data, with the steepest declines in Oakland, where violent crime fell 25%, and San Francisco, where it fell 21%.

Newsom’s new website highlights Trump’s sweeping use of presidential pardons to grant clemency to roughly 1,500 people charged or convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The governor’s office said some of those individuals had prior criminal records and that others went on to be convicted of new crimes after receiving pardons.

The move mirrors tactics Trump and his administration have embraced. Most recently, Trump unveiled a website of “media offenders,” naming journalists and outlets he accuses of bias. Newsom’s office pushed back on the comparison, saying the journalists targeted by Trump were accused of bias rather than criminal conduct, unlike those listed on the California site.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem has maintained a website highlighting what it calls the “worst of the worst” criminal immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, framing the page as evidence that the administration is carrying out Trump’s promise of mass deportations.

The state’s website launch comes as Newsom seeks to cast California as a national leader in responsible governance of artificial intelligence.

Earlier Tuesday, the governor announced a slate of initiatives aimed at promoting ethical AI use in state government, including a new advisory council, partnerships with academic and nonprofit groups, and a generative AI assistant for state employees. Among the priorities outlined are strengthening safeguards for children online, countering image-based abuse and improving government operations.

“California is at the forefront of AI technology — and is home to some of the most successful and innovative companies and academic leaders in the world,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’re not going to sit on the sidelines and let others define the future for us. But we’re going to do it responsibly — making sure we capture the benefits, mitigate the harms, and continue to lead with the values that define this state.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4231d52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F10%2Fd956ee3c43a8aec41546eac8fcb4%2Fla-photos-1staff-682883-na-pol-certification-protest-kkn-0249.JPG,N,,2025-12-17 10:57:39.743520

“I want my mom back.”

A military-style ICE raid occurs at a grocery story in West Norriton, Pennsylvania on July 16, 2025. How would you feel if you found this waiting for you on your next trip to buy groceries?

These are real questions and comments I’ve heard from the kids I work with at Project Libertad in recent days, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terrorizes their communities daily. While newcomers have always faced higher rates of anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other mental health challenges than their US-born peers, the divide is becoming more apparent each day. These conversations with my kids represent a stark increase in fear and anxiety among immigrant children—and it’s not just an anecdotal shift. The data are clear: The Trump administration’s increasingly hostile immigration policies are irreversibly harming children.

Pediatricians Susan Kressly and Michelle Barnes warn of the lifelong impact these policies have on children’s development and health into adulthood:

Witnessing harm to others and living in constant fear is traumatic to all children in the community. These stressors disrupt brain development and have long-term negative effects on the health and well-being of impacted children. Ultimately, the cumulative effects make these communities less healthy.

Similarly, nonprofit newsroom CalMatters documents strained mental health among schoolchildren across California after a summer of widespread, aggressive ICE raids and warns of the long-term harm to children:

Experts say these raids and their aftermath may also have long-term consequences. Constant vigilance and worry puts children at greater risk of developing chronic anxiety and depression. Those who are separated from a parent face a host of social and emotional challenges.

A 2025 study in the Children and Youth Services Review showed that childhood exposure to “severe immigration enforcement”—which includes not just deportation, but also things like fear or arrest—is “significantly associated” with having anxiety as a young adult. The study’s authors call for “reforming immigration policies that unnecessarily harm members of families… and encourages social workers and allied professionals to recognize exposure to enforcement as a traumatic experience...”

A new report in Psychiatry Online highlights the long-term, generational trauma caused by immigration enforcement and calls for the mental health community to not only improve treatment for immigrant youth and families, but also to join advocacy efforts in support of their immigrant patients.

Another recent study out of Florida from the from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows a 22% increase in student absences since January, a direct result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement there. The study blames fears of deportation and family separation for the decrease in school attendance. That same study showed a decrease in students’ test scores linked to immigration enforcement.

The trauma of mass deportation also impacts US-born children of immigrant parents, who live in constant fear of being separated from their parents. For many, that nightmare has now become a reality. CNN identified over 100 US citizen children who were left behind after a parent was deported, ranging in age from babies to teens.

The research is clear; there is no debate to be had: US immigration policy is hurting children. All that’s left to do is decide what type of society we want to be. Are we a society that cares about the well-being of children? It’s a yes or no question. There’s no “but” or “if” or “only certain children” or “they should’ve come here legally” (don’t even get me started—you can read more on that faulty argument here). We either care about human rights—or we don’t.

James Baldwin wrote in The Nation in a 1980 essay:

The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality.

November 11, 2025

A Harris County judge on Tuesday rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to shut down a program that allocates county funds to help undocumented people access legal support.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and in October appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

Paxton had called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. On Tuesday, a judge disagreed, declining to block the program.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a “clear defeat” for Paxton.

“The court saw this lawsuit for exactly what it was: a cheap political stunt designed to score headlines,” Menefee said. “Harris County will not be intimidated or pushed around by state officials who are more interested in pandering than governing.”

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He asked the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: After Tuesday’s ruling, Menefee accused Paxton of cherry-picking facts about the program and ignoring its “clear public purpose.”

“These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,” Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said. “Making sure they can resolve their immigration status strengthens our economy, keeps families together, and makes our community safer.”

In a statement, Menefee and members of the Harris County Commissioners’ Court accused Paxton of using this program to bolster his conservative credentials during a heated primary for U.S. Senate.

“Providing legal support to immigrants who are trying to ‘do it the right way’ was never a concern to the Attorney General’s Office,” Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. “That is, until Ken Paxton decided to run for higher office.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",http://media.iadsnetwork.com/facebookthumbnail/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:58:36.443986

The rights group said forced returns were taking place even as Afghanistan struggles with widespread poverty, climate shocks and severe restrictions on women’s rights under Taliban rule.

The call follows remarks last week by UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) deputy head Georgette Gagnon, who told the UN Security Council that about 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country so far, a figure she said represented a 6% population increase that is intensifying existing economic, climate and humanitarian pressures.

In a statement, Amnesty said Afghanistan faces a “deepening humanitarian crisis” and warned of a “real risk of serious harm” to returnees.

The organisation said countries must comply with international law prohibiting the forced return of people to places where they face a real risk of serious human rights violations.

“Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran during decades of conflict, meaning many young people have never lived in Afghanistan,” Amnesty said, adding that both countries have increasingly pressured Afghans to leave in recent years.

Amnesty also cited media reports that Germany, Austria and the European Union are holding talks with Taliban officials to facilitate deportations, warning that many returnees are unable to find work, while women and girls face sweeping restrictions under Taliban rule.

“This rush to forcibly return people to Afghanistan ignores why they fled in the first place and the serious dangers they face upon return,” said Smriti Singh, Amnesty’s South Asia director.

ICE agents drag woman across street

What happened:

Federal immigration authorities conducted a targeted operation near Karmel Mall on Monday, where dozens of protesters started throwing chunks of ice at them and shouted death threats, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Video that circulated online shows agents dragging a woman across a street. The crowd said she was pregnant. The woman, who was not identified, was released over safety concerns, authorities said.

The other side:

DHS officials say the woman who was dragged tried to vandalize a squad car.

The agency said officers abandoned their attempt to arrest her over safety concerns after protesters hurled chunks of ice and rocks at agents and deployed pepper spray against them.

The proposed lease, which was struck down 11-1 on Monday, would have reserved 1,200 square feet of ground space for Key Lime Air. The space would have been used for storage purposes, including employee parking, an office trailer and snow removal equipment.

Council member Kevin Flynn was the lone vote in favor of the resolution, citing financial reasons in a statement to MS NOW on Tuesday.

“Rejecting the lease actually saved money for Key Lime Air because they will continue shared use of the common area for free. It made sense to me to start charging them. In any case, they cannot be excluded from the airport,” Flynn said.

“I have been following Key Lime Air for the greater part of this year and have been monitoring what’s been going on with them, and I am very concerned about the illegal deportations that this vendor is taking part in at the Centennial Airport,” council member Stacie Gilmore said Monday. The airline is based at Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County, Colorado.

Gilmore added, “I think it’s an important stance to say that it is not an allowable use on city property, the city and county of Denver’s property, to have a vendor out there that is actively breaking people’s unconstitutional rights and due process,” Gilmore said.

Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez, who also voted against the expansion, told MS NOW she is “proud” the proposed resolution failed.

“Our city chose to stand with immigrants and against the expansion of deportation flights because we know that our immigrant neighbors deserve a city that welcomes everybody, not one further invested in separating families and deporting members of our community,” she said Tuesday.

According to a recent Human Rights First flight monitor report, the airline made at least 162 flights chartered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month. The report also shows that so far this year, there have been 122 Key Lime Air outbound immigration enforcement flights out of Denver.

It is not immediately clear how or if the rejection of the lease will affect the airport’s Federal Aviation Administration grants.

“I have no interest in supporting this deportation machine, and if an aviation grant is what’s on the line there, it’s very clear to me where the city shall stand on that and where my obligations are to people in this city and around the country,” council member Sarah Parady said Monday.

Amendments offered by moderate Republicans to the House GOP health care bill that would extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies with various other provisions attached will not get a floor vote tomorrow.

The amendments were blocked from getting a vote at a meeting of the House Rules Committee this afternoon, when the moderate Republicans argued that failing to vote to extend the subsidies for 22 million people would have consequences.

“There will be consequences if these amendments are not made in order,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., said at the hearing before the amendments were blocked. “I think the only thing worse than a clean extension without any income limits and any reforms, because it’s not a perfect system, the only thing worse than that would be expiration.”

Blocking the amendment leaves members of Congress with only one option to force a vote on extending the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies: coalescing around a discharge petition to force a vote on the House floor. The subsidies are set to expire at the end of the month if Congress fails to act.

Democrats on the Rules Committee urged the moderate Republicans to either vote down the rule tomorrow on the House floor, which would block the GOP health care bill altogether, or join them in their discharge petition for a clean three-year extension of the ACA subsidies.

“I hope my colleagues, my Republican colleagues who testified, including Mr. Fitzpatrick, will understand that negotiating with this committee, at least under the current circumstances, is not a prudent way forward to get this issue resolved,” Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said at the hearing. “And ultimately, it strikes me that really the only way it gets resolved is a couple of Republican members voting against the rule tomorrow or joining with us on our discharge petition. Because I think if we do that, particularly the latter, we can get a clean extension on its way to the president’s desk.”

The Democrats’ three-year clean extension of the enhanced subsidies has already failed in the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said it would be a nonstarter if it came back over from the House. But Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said he believes passing that bill in the House would force the Senate’s hand.

“I think if something passes here, including the three-year extension, the pressure on the Senate will be so enormous that I think the winds will change,” McGovern said.

Susie Wiles generally helps quietly shape headlines. She is rarely the focus of them.

That changed in dramatic fashion today after Vanity Fair published a deeply reported profile of Wiles, the 68-year-old White House chief of staff, whose decadeslong career in politics has been defined by a measured, steady-the-ship tone, never one that could be construed as undermining her boss.

In the two-part Vanity Fair piece — which included 11 interviews over nearly a year, with the White House’s cooperation — Wiles comes off as far more candid than her public persona. She not only speaks openly about both Trump and those who make up the core of his administration, but she also appears to acknowledge that at times she has been at odds with some of the policies that have been central to Trump’s second term. While it is not unusual for chiefs of staff to disagree with the presidents they serve, those concerns generally remain part of private conversations.

Wiles revealed there had been “huge disagreements” over implementing tariffs, acknowledged that the administration must “look harder” at its process for mass deportation and said she had to “get on board” with Trump’s decision to give blanket pardons to Jan. 6 defendants. She said she initially believed only those who did not commit violent acts should be pardoned.

Trump wrote tonight on Truth Social that he is ordering a blockade of all ""sanctioned oil tankers"" entering and leaving Venezuela.

Trump is ramping up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has sanctioned three of Maduro's nephews and repeatedly conducted military strikes against boats from the Caribbean that it alleges are carrying drugs.

Trump is expected to sign an executive order as soon as this week that would fast-track the reclassification of cannabis and acknowledge its medical benefits for the first time at the federal level, four people with direct knowledge of the plans told NBC News.

Cannabis is classified in the same category as heroin and LSD under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Moving the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III would ease regulatory hurdles and allow the Food and Drug Administration to study cannabis for medical purposes, potentially opening it up for wider medical use by seniors, veterans and others as a pharmaceutical, irrespective of state laws.

The executive order would not make cannabis legal at the federal level, however.

Trump said yesterday his administration is “considering” the move. “We are considering that because a lot of people want to see it — the reclassification — because it leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify. So we are looking at that very strongly,” Trump told reporters.

The preservation group sued the Trump administration last week in a bid to halt an expansive revamp of the White House property that has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats. The lawsuit alleges the administration broke ground before plans were submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission and without approval from Congress, as required for construction on federal park land in Washington.

The Trump administration told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon today that within the next “two weeks” it expects to meet with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts to review plans that Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson told the court were not yet finalized.

Tad Heuer, the national trust’s attorney, quipped that with this administration, “it’s always going to happen in the next two weeks.”

Two nonprofit groups launched an ad campaign today offering legal information and confidential advice to help U.S. troops who believe they may have received unlawful orders.

The effort will include billboards saying “Obey Only Lawful Orders” and online messages providing links to organizations and information to ensure troops are aware of their rights and informed about their options, organizers told NBC News.

The move comes amid intense debate over the legality of the Trump administration’s military strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats in Latin America, which some lawmakers and legal experts say violate U.S. and international law.

“If you believe you’ve received a ‘manifestly unlawful order,’ you are protected by law and you are not alone,” reads one online message, addressed to “every U.S. service member.”

The White House said today that Trump will be in Delaware tomorrow to meet with families of the two American service members who were killed in Syria over the weekend.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Trump's travel plans in a Fox News interview this afternoon.

Trump will be heading to Dover Air Force Base ""to meet with the families of the fallen and to receive their bodies here at home,"" Leavitt said.

Two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed in Syria, and other personnel were injured, in an incident that the Defense Department described as a counterterrorism engagement. Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social that “there will be very serious retaliation"" following the attack.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reflected on Trump’s second term in a series of interviews for a two-part profile published today by Vanity Fair, speaking candidly about key players in the administration who have influence over Trump and some of the administration’s more controversial policies.

Wiles, 68, spoke to Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple, an expert on White House chiefs of staff, 11 times over the past year about a range of issues, including the administration’s Venezuela strategy and efforts to slash the size of the federal government.

She also said Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality,” despite the fact that Trump does not drink alcohol, making a comparison with her father, television sportscaster Pat Summerall, who she said suffered from alcoholism.

“Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,” Wiles said. “And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” She added that Trump “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”

The Trump administration is expanding its travel ban to include five more countries and impose new limits on others.

The move is part of ongoing efforts to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration. The decision follows the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

In June, Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and that those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.

At the time, the ban cover Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

Speaking to reporters after their classified briefing with Hegseth and Rubio, Democratic senators called for the unedited video of the Sept. 2 ""double tap"" strike to be released to the entire chamber.

Republican senators, meanwhile, said they were satisfied with what they learned from the briefing.

""There’s no doubt in my mind that we have the legal authority to blow up these boats,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said.

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told reporters that he was left with ""more questions"" after the briefing than when he walked in.

""What I did learn down there is they don’t want to be that transparent with us. There were six briefers that used up about 35 to 40 minutes of the hour that we had, and then we had 20 minutes for questions,"" Kelly said. ""So, of 100 senators in the room, maybe six of us got to ask questions of the group, and then it was over, then they left.""

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told reporters that the video will remain classified ""because the sensitivity of some of the equipment that were being used in the techniques.""

""It’s at a highly classified level. I said that as soon as I came here. It has nothing to do with overclassifying it,"" Mullin said. ""This administration has been highly transparent.""

Trump annouced on Truth Social that he would deliver a live address to the nation from the White House tomorrow night.

""My Fellow Americans: I will be giving an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,"" he said. ""I look forward to 'seeing' you then. It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the address would focus on what Trump sees as his biggest accomplishments of the year and preview what's to come next year.

""The best is truly yet to come, as he often says, and so he’ll be addressing the country about all of his historic accomplishments over the past year and maybe teasing some policy that will be coming in the new year, as well as we head into this Christmas season,"" she said.

Asked for his response to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles' calling him a ""conspiracy theorist,"" Vance downplayed the remarks, saying he had joked in ""public and private"" with her about being a conspiracy theorist ""for a long time.""

The ""conspiracy theorist"" comments come from a two-part Vanity Fair story, published today, in which Wiles shared thoughts on senior White House staff and Cabinet members. In the article, Wiles said that Vance understood that the Jeffrey Epstein issue would be a big deal because he had long been a conspiracy theorist.

""Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,"" Vance said before he listed examples, including masks for toddlers during the pandemic and questioning Joe Biden's ability to serve as president because of his age.

""So at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it,"" he said.

While Vance said he and Wiles ""agree on as much as they disagree,"" he praised her for her loyalty to Trump.

""And you know why I really love Susie Wiles? It's because Susie is who she is in the president’s presence [and] she’s the same exact person when the president isn’t around,"" he said. ""I’ve never seen Susie Wiles say something to the president and then go and counteract him or subvert his will behind the scenes.""

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said that the administration’s accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James “might” be “retribution” and that “when there’s an opportunity” for Trump to take retribution, “he will go for it,” Vanity Fair reported in a new profile of Wiles.

Vanity Fair published the two-part profile today based on a wide-ranging series of 11 interviews over a year with Wiles, who rarely grants public interviews and generally stays out of the spotlight. The profile provides a rare look into the mindset of one of the most powerful people in the White House.

Reached for comment on Wiles’ remarks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wiles “has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.”

“President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,” Leavitt said in the statement. “The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.”

Asked about efforts by congressional Republicans to reach a deal to extend ACA subsidies, Vance said it's on those members of Congress to ""step up"" and fix a ""broken"" health care system.

""The health insurance system is totally broken. It’s been broken for 15 years,"" he said. ""We think that everything should be on the table, but Democrats and Republicans, they got to work together and put something on the president’s desk to sign.""

Vance said the administration was ""talking"" with Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno, of Ohio, and Susan Collins, of Maine, about health care legislation, as well as some ""reasonable Democrats who are putting ideas out there."" But he reiterated that it wasn't Trump's sole responsibility to fix health care.

""Congress has got to get us something to lower the cost of health insurance for American citizens; the Obamacare system was broken,"" Vance said. ""Donald J. Trump wants to fix it, but Congress has got to step up here.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said today that he won’t call a vote to extend the enhanced subsidies, effectively guaranteeing they will expire at the end of the month.

Vance said at the event that the administration is trying to lower costs but that it won't happen overnight.

Blaming the impact of inflation during the Biden administration for a loss of purchasing power for average Americans, Vance said: ""It’s going to take a little bit of time where they really feel like that money has been put back in their pocket. That just takes a lot of time. It’s a lot of work.""

""You've got to lower costs,"" he said. ""That’s why we're lowering regulations on American energy to get gas and groceries down. Now, how does energy connect to groceries? Because if the truck that takes the groceries to the grocery store is paying out the wazoo for diesel fuel, then that means every American is going to be paying more at the grocery.""

""We do believe that if we keep on making the right decisions, we keep on investing in the United States of America, we are going to find that the American citizens can afford a good life in their country,"" he said, but ""Rome wasn't built in a day.""

Speaking to supporters at a manufacturing plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Vice President JD Vance blamed the Biden administration and Democrats for the affordability strain felt by many Americans.

""I'm a little surprised by when the Democrats talk all the time about affordability,"" he said. ""Democrats say, 'You know, things aren't affordable, this isn't affordable, this has gotten more expensive, drugs have gotten more expensive, housing has gotten more expensive,' and you know what, they're right — and it was because of them.""

Vance touted last month's job numbers, saying that thousands of jobs were added to the economy and that wages grew in November. The jobs data the administration released this morning showed that employment declined in October by more than 100,000 jobs before it partially rebounded in November.

""Private-sector wage growth grow at a rate of 4.2%. You know what that means? That means we're seeing the fastest private-sector wage growth that we have seen in this country in many, many years,"" Vance said.

NBC News reported that wage growth remained sluggish last month, with average hourly earnings rising by just 0.1%. Over the past year, average wages have increased by 3.5%.

The United States shed 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said this morning, lifting a monthslong fog that had shrouded the labor market.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November.

The national employment picture already looked fragile before the report. Jobs reports in June and August showed net job losses, the first time since 2020 that there have been two months of contractions before November.

September’s report, the last one before the government shutdown, showed a more modest increase of 119,000 jobs and a little changed unemployment rate of 4.4%.

Trump’s response to the death of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, just hours after the murders were announced, drew outrage and swift backlash from both sides of the aisle. In a social media post, the president suggested the director was killed over his political opposition to him, writing that Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome.” NBC’s Garrett Haake reports for ""TODAY"" from the White House.

The BBC has said it will defend itself against a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump yesterday, which alleges the British public broadcaster defamed him in a documentary before last year’s presidential election by deceptively editing parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech.

In a brief statement, the BBC said it would fight the lawsuit, raising the possibility of a legal battle over whether the edit of the speech caused harm to the president’s reputation.

Eight alleged “narco-terrorists” were killed yesterday in U.S. strikes on three suspected drug vessels in the eastern Pacific, defense officials announced.

U.S. Southern Command said in a social media post that the strikes, among about two dozen conducted in the region since early September, were ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Three people were killed in the first vessel, two in the second and three in the third, Southern Command said. The boats were allegedly being operated by U.S-designated terrorist groups in international waters, and Southern Command said they were using known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking.

An answer is finally coming to a question that economists, consumers and even the chair of the Federal Reserve have been asking for months: What is happening with the nation’s labor market?

Emerging from the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release a long-awaited trove of employment data today: October’s payrolls and November’s full jobs report are both set to be published at 8:30 a.m. ET.

After months in a data fog, economists broadly expect to see net job losses overall in October, followed by a slight rebound and gains in November.

A majority of U.S. adults, 55%, say they will spend less on holiday gifts this year compared with last year, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey, highlighting how inflation has changed spending habits.

Only 9% say they will spend more on holiday gifts this year, while 36% say they’ll spend about the same. The results are part of broader data showing some concern about the state of the economy.

The poll found deep partisan differences in how Americans view the U.S. economy, with those differences showing up in holiday shopping sentiment, too.

(WTVD) -- A Raleigh father is sharing with ABC11 what he says he experienced inside a federal immigration detention center, and the health battle he says he's now facing.

David Cardenas Centeno said what was supposed to be a routine, annual check-in for his asylum case turned into a nine-day ordeal that ended in a Charlotte-area hospital.

""It's hard. I'm a human being. We don't deserve this. Immigrants, we don't deserve this,"" he said.

Centeno and his family say they escaped violence in Nicaragua and claimed asylum in 2022.

He says he and his wife have working permits, social security numbers, and believe they have the ability to stay in the country while their asylum case makes its way through the courts.

That's why he was shocked when he was detained by federal immigration officials during his routine immigration check-in on December 4 in Charlotte.

His wife, Cecilia Mendoza, says she and their daughters were shocked.

""My daughters started crying when I told them because, well, it's expected when you go through this heartbreak.""

Centeno claims he has no criminal record, and says he's concerned about what he says were the conditions in federal custody.

""There, you don't feel like a human being. You feel like nothing. You feel like trash,"" he said. ""There's one toilet, where everyone can see you, and there's 40 people in one cell.""

ABC11 asked ICE about the conditions in the detention center.

During his stay, he says he was also denied medical care. He tells ABC11 he is diabetic and has heart conditions, saying his pleas for help while in custody went unanswered.

""I finally got medical attention for my condition when they saw that I basically had fainted in the cell,"" said Centeno.

This entire time his wife says she had no idea what was going on, until she says she got an anonymous message.

""I don't know who they were. All they said was, 'Get a lawyer, he's in really bad shape,'"" said Mendoza.

Federal agents released Centeno from custody on Friday, after community members in Charlotte, where he was detained, pushed for his release.

Centeno says he was never told why he was detained.

""All they said was you're going to be deported. Maybe you'll see a judge, but that's it,"" he said.

Centeno says his doctors tell him he needs open heart surgery, but says he is still too weak to be operated on after this experience.

Still, he says he needed to speak out about what happened.

""If I don't speak publicly and stay silent out of fear, they could keep doing this to other people,"" he said.

Centeno says he was deported in 2013 for using a different name to enter the country, and says the Department of Homeland Security has not returned his immigration paperwork since he was detained.

Editor's note: All quotes from Centeno and Mendoza have been translated from Spanish.

ABC11 reached out to DHS and ICE, asking why Centeno was detained, why it apparently took so long for him to receive medical care, and how the conditions in the detention center are.

The Public Affairs Officer for ICE sent ABC11 this statement on Wednesday:

""David Cruz-Cardenas does not have lawful immigration status and was taken into custody. Shortly after his arrest, he complained of chest pains and was transported to the hospital, where he was subsequently admitted. During his hospitalization, Mr. Cruz-Cardenas was guarded by Enforcement and Removal Operations officers and his communication with the outside world was limited due to security precautions.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators.","Some Republicans in Congress are splitting from the Trump administration over its crackdown on legal immigration from Afghanistan, especially for those migrants who helped U.S. war efforts there.

Over the past year, the U.S. has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, among others. Those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.

Further immigration restrictions followed after an Afghan national was charged in the deadly shooting of a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., last month.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., cautioned against a ""knee-jerk reaction"" that could block a number of Afghans with valid cases for temporary or permanent immigration status from coming to the U.S.

""One thing we've forgotten is how important that is for our special operators,"" Tillis said, referencing examples of his own constituents with deep attachments to Afghans abroad. ""It puts them in a more dangerous spot if we lose sight of that.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also worried about the impact on Afghans from the cuts.

""There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops,"" Collins said. ""I've talked to veterans who have been very concerned about the safety of Afghans who have helped us. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting than occurred during the Biden administration.""

The GOP divisions come as President Trump spent the bulk of his 2024 presidential campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history.

Some Republicans have also pushed back against changes to visa programs for migrant laborers and in favor of more permanent status for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Afghan soldiers who assisted U.S. troops have, in the past, enjoyed bipartisan support for their immigration cases.

This included Afghans who had helped U.S. troops, immigration advocates said. Afghanistan was one of the top countries sending refugees to the U.S. in fiscal year 2024, according to Homeland Security Department data; out of just over 100,000 refugees admitted that year, 14,680 were from Afghanistan.

Some Republicans first raised concern about the pause's impact on those who had assisted U.S. armed forces.

The refugee program has since been significantly scaled back, and the target demographic for entrants is now white South Africans, according to the administration.

In June, Trump added Afghanistan to a list of 19 countries for which travel to the U.S. would be restricted.

And after the attack on National Guard members in D.C. around Thanksgiving, the Trump administration paused processing asylum cases, green cards and other immigration services for those from the countries listed in June's travel ban. It also paused processing all visas specifically for Afghans.

Trump has argued that those who came from Afghanistan were not properly vetted under the Biden administration.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man charged in connection with the shooting, was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 under the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome program. He was then granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.

""This animal would've never been here if not for Joe Biden's dangerous policies which allowed countless unvetted criminals to invade our country and harm the American people,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to a request for comment about the Republican divisions.

It is not clear what could have been uncovered through additional vetting before Lakanwal arrived to the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the suspect could have been radicalized after coming to the U.S. At the same time, advocates have long criticized agencies such as the CIA and DHS for failing to provide resources, including for mental health, for Afghan soldiers transitioning to life in America after experiencing harrowing violence.

Questions about Congress's role

Immigrant advocacy groups accuse lawmakers of ceding their power to the president when it comes to immigration policy.

""Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight,"" Shawn VanDiver, the founder of the organization AfghanEvac, which advocates for Afghans who worked with U.S. troops, said during a press conference. ""Failing to modernize the asylum, refugee, or [special immigrant visa] systems. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fear-mongering, not facts; politics, not policy.""

Congress this year has passed very few immigration-related bills, mostly focusing on funding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement efforts. Many other legislative efforts to facilitate or reform immigration processes have been at a standstill.

But some Republicans are happy to leave immigration in the administration's hands.

""Primarily, that's an executive branch issue,"" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said about the vetting process of Afghans and other immigrants.

""Our staff are not the ones that are actually doing the vetting. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point.""

Republican leaders also appear aligned with the Trump administration on the topic.

House Republicans stripped a bipartisan provision from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have brought back an office at the State Department that relocates Afghan refugees. The legislation passed the House last week and is set for a Senate vote this week.

""Republican leadership tanked months of bipartisan work,"" Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., who introduced the provision, said in a statement. ""It is truly shameful that my Republican colleagues, some of whom served in Afghanistan and uniquely understand the debt we owe our allies, have once again put blind loyalty to Trump over American principles and obligations.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told NPR that one solution to the question of Afghan vetting would be to pass the ""Fulfilling Promises to Afghan Allies Act,"" which provides a pathway for Afghans to apply for legal permanent residency, following additional vetting, and is supported by senators of both parties. The bill was introduced in August, but has not seen a committee vote.

""I'd like to see the bill that I sponsored, which would have increased vetting on anybody applying here, to take effect before we make another decision,"" Cassidy said.

Still, enthusiasm to tackle anything immigration-related in this Congress is low.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators. But he told NPR that now is not the right time to restart that conversation, without elaborating on his reasons.

""It's premature to talk about that,"" Cornyn said.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/d74160c71d0348963a0d5ea1180d4585?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-12-17 10:57:53.750394

I don’t know of any organization that shows as much humanity as IOM does in telling the stories of migrants.

I worked for over 17 years in international journalism before making the leap to institutional communication in humanitarian organizations. I believe journalism remains an honest profession, one that aligns with my conviction that storytelling is a fundamental human need.

One of the first migrants I met was a Japanese professor who had left his country disillusioned. Japan had lost World War II, and he had lost family and friends in the Hiroshima bombing. That event devastated countless lives and broke his unquestioning faith in the nationalism and militarism of early twentieth-century Japan. Years later, he left the country on his own terms and moved to Spain, trying to make sense of how his homeland had failed him and drawn him into a senseless war.

Almost as human as migrating is telling singular stories like his – giving a face to people while also sharing their past and context. Since 2019, I’ve had the privilege of being the Communication Coordinator for IOM Mexico, working with a wonderful team that strives to help our audiences better understand who migrants are, where they come from, what they long for, and what they dream about.

Our goal is to capture the pivotal moments in these people’s lives, but also what they value, what worries them, what they miss. Only in this way do we fully respect their dignity and show the humanity we all share, that connects us all.

There are always surprises. Once, I asked a man migrating through southern Mexico what his most precious possession was. He pulled out a wallet from his backpack containing a letter his little daughter had written before he left. He held it between his fingers and, while showing it to me, said he couldn’t read, yet that paper was his greatest treasure. It moved me deeply.

Moments and conversations like that shake our way of thinking, disrupt our life priorities, and affect our values. In a way, they reveal the depth of what migration means for human beings. It’s not just a phase – it’s part of their lives.

I believe IOM is a unique, honest organization. It can make a difference in the world of humanitarian communication because no other organization has the same drive or ambition to help us better understand those who migrate.

It’s not an easy task because the dominant narrative around migration is different – and we don’t control it. It’s often shaped by politicians who turn migration into a crisis, automatically associating migrants with “illegality.” And it’s often driven by opinion leaders and media outlets that exploit migration as a weapon and deny its deeply human dimension.

From 2021 to 2025, IOM’s Global Media and Migration Academy (GMMA) has worked in this direction with young journalists, content creators, filmmakers, communication students, and civil society partners. It’s been a valuable project that I’ve had the pleasure of supporting alongside those leading it from IOM Ireland and headquarters.

For IOM, it’s migrants themselves who should tell their stories, have their own voice, and be respected wherever they are. Every migrant is a unique person asking for a chance to let us know who they are and why they’ve come this far.

Creating space for migrants to speak for themselves and be seen for who they are is a simple act of humanity that helps restore their voice, their power and their dignity.

In a world crowded with misinformation and distortion, IOM’s presence matters more than ever. The stories it tells make a real difference, offering a clear and humane counterpoint to narratives built on fear and contempt.

Migrants, like everyone else, seek safety, dignity and a chance to build the futures they imagine. Our role at IOM is to help the world see them clearly, understand their journeys, and recognize their humanity.",https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl2616/files/styles/social_media/public/banner/alberto-cabezas_02-0.png?h=0e3678a1&itok=hG-kgmmq,N,,2025-12-16 22:57:34.741086

A neighbor tells KATU that a man by the name of Erik Tellez was arrested by ICE agents. While we were not able to confirm his immigration status, public records show that a man by the name of Erik Alonso Tellez pleaded guilty to Driving Under the Influence in 2017. The charge was dismissed in 2019, after Tellez completed Oregon's diversion program.

Wilson, along with District 2 Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney, Councilor Sameer Kanal, and Councilor Dan Ryan, all condemned the report that ICE agents deployed pepper ball chemical munitions during the arrest.

In a video, which we obtained from a neighbor, you can see the deployment of what appears to be pepper balls.

That deployment came after a back and forth with people in the neighborhood.

Neighbor Jaslyn Cincotta says it all started when when in a man in her neighborhood was being arrested by ICE agents. She says he was on his way to drop his kids off at school.

As people in the neighborhood got involved, things escalated.

“When the one protester came, and came closer than they wanted, that’s when they started really, they pushed them back, they shot three or four rounds at their feet, then they pushed me out of the way,"" Cincotta.

She says more rounds were deployed.

""There's 40 or 50 neighbors, the kids trying to walk to school who all then got this giant wave of itchy smoke in our eyes,"" said Cincotta. ""My husband had to go and like get a glass of water for one of the middle schoolers who was walking by 'cause she, because the middle schooler couldn't breathe.""

I sat down with district two councilor Sameer Kanal on Tuesday. Kanal teamed up with the mayor to denounce the alleged deployment. The neighborhood where it all happened is also in his jurisdiction.

He gave us his reaction to the reports of the deployment.

""We were not surprised. We knew that this would happen because it's happened in other cities and we had brought in Chicago LA, DC. representatives to our committee of public safety committee a couple months ago, and they warned us about a few potential things that might happen, including the use of chemical munitions in the street, in L.A. in particular, and we've seen it elsewhere now in the Chicago area too. So, not surprised, still horrified. Still appalled by it, still outraged.""

Next year, Kanal says we will learn more about his proposal to ban chemical munitions from being deployed against Portlanders.

""In Q1 of next year, we'll be talking about how we can create these sorts of protections against the use of indiscriminate chemical weapons,"" said Kanal.

The four city leaders put out the following joint statement about the alleged incident:

“ICE activity in North Portland, including the recent unnecessary, unjustified, and potentially unconstitutional use of chemical munitions, directly contradicts Portland's values. As Portland's civic leaders, we condemn ICE's unjustified, disruptive, and escalatory conduct, which undermines public trust in government. We call on federal authorities to immediately cease the use of chemical munitions in our neighborhoods, wear body-worn cameras, and identify themselves when engaging with our community. Chemical munitions cannot, and will not, compel our community to accept ICE enforcement we have not asked for and do not want.”

The lawsuit, led by California and Massachusetts and joined by 20 states including Washington, challenges a Department of Homeland Security rule announced in September that sharply raises the cost of hiring highly skilled foreign workers. The H-1B visa program allows employers to temporarily hire workers in specialty occupations that require advanced or specialized knowledge, including technology, medicine, and scientific research.

RELATED: Fred Hutch, UW Medicine halt new foreign worker visa petitions due to $100K fee

Attorney General Nick Brown said the fee would have immediate consequences for Washington’s public institutions. Nearly 500 H-1B visa holders currently work across the state’s public agencies, colleges, and universities, according to his office.

The effects, however, would extend beyond the public sector.

Washington is home to some of the country’s largest users of H-1B visas. Amazon welcomed nearly 16,400 foreign workers in 2021, at the program’s peak for the company in recent years. More recently, Microsoft led the state with 6,258 approved H-1B applications in the past year.

The new fee represents a steep jump from existing H-1B application costs, which typically range from about $1,000 to $7,600. Under the policy, employers would be responsible for covering the entire $100,000 charge.

The Trump administration has said the H-1B program is abused and overused, but state officials argue the fee was imposed without legal authority. In the lawsuit, the coalition contends the Department of Homeland Security implemented the fee without congressional authorization and without following the notice-and-comment process required under federal law.

“This was implemented by the Department of Homeland Security without the authorization from Congress, without the legally required notice-and-comment process, and in direct violation of the law,” California's Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Friday.

Some Washington employers have already put hiring on hold. The University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center have paused all H-1B applications, according to statements from the two organizations sent to KING 5.

Jay Gairson, an immigration attorney said the fee would place a heavy financial burden not only on major corporations but also on smaller and private employers that rely on the visa program to fill specialized roles.

He also rejected the idea that the higher fee would lead to more jobs for unemployed Americans.

""People that are struggling to find jobs are in our middle and our lower economic sectors,"" Gairson said. ""They're working in labor industry and in industries where have slowly disappeared and been shipped overseas already. So what we're doing by adding this fee is essentially transporting even more work overseas rather than keeping it here.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/11a292da-b542-4aeb-8319-b812f66f0325/20251217T014853/11a292da-b542-4aeb-8319-b812f66f0325_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 00:59:25.480324

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

They gathered at bus stops in the afternoon, keeping a watchful eye in case immigration authorities showed up. Some drove home students who did not feel comfortable walking or taking the bus. Teachers called families with immigrant backgrounds one by one to inform them that ICE was in the neighborhood, and that their children were safe at school. (Activity had been reported at Sip Cafe, about a block from Dan Mills Elementary.)

While Christine Pulle and other parents monitored the bus stop at her daughter’s middle school, her husband drove around Inglewood, on the lookout for ICE vehicles. She returned to the bus stop the next morning during drop-off.

“I don’t know the best way to be effective help,” she reflected later. “A willingness to show up is all I have.”

Like the other teachers at her school, Sonia LeBlanc went down her list of students who are English learners (EL) and called their families, who come from all over the world including Afghanistan, Mexico and Somalia. LeBlanc said she returned to teaching after a hiatus to “be there on the frontlines” to support EL students, and she felt proud to see the community rally around that cause last week.

“Nashville is so big,” she said, “and then stuff like this happens, and you get real clear on that we’re just a small town taking care of each other.”

Some see last week’s events as a wake-up call for the East Nashville community. When it comes to immigration enforcement, much of the attention has been on South Nashville, which was the target of sweeping ICE raids in the spring. For many in East Nashville, Wednesday was their first time responding to reports of ICE activity in their neighborhood — and they are aware that it may not be the last.

But the need outweighs the resources and infrastructure available in the area, according to Heather Wood, a volunteer literacy tutor who works with EL students. Many of the organizations dedicated to supporting immigrants are concentrated in South Nashville. While the school district refers families to these organizations, she said those in East Nashville often don’t have the means or transportation to get there.

“It feels lonely over here,” Wood said.

After the rapid response last week, community members are reflecting on how to move forward and effectively protect their neighbors. Wood said there’s “a handful of people really trying to help these kids feel safe,” and hopes that people who contributed will stay involved. She noted there’s often a rise in response to reports of immigration enforcement that then dissipates when the immediate crisis is over.

She encourages people to get to know their immigrant neighbors. That can look like enrolling in schools with diverse student populations, asking EL teachers about ways they can help, or just getting involved with local public schools. She believes these personal relationships are “protective factors” that can broaden students’ networks of support among the adults in their lives.

“We need to be accompanying the most vulnerable kids in our community all the time,” she said, “not just the day that ICE vehicles get here.”

MNPS parent Colleen Fowlkes echoed the call for more people to get involved and pay attention.

“I think people will look back at this and maybe feel some shame or sadness around the part that they played — or didn’t play,” she said. “Especially when there’s people missing in communities.”

As a mother who “could not do without” her family, Fowlkes said she doesn’t feel that she has a choice but to be involved.

“I don’t think anything is more important right now than keeping people safe in our community.”

‘This is a safe place’

Efforts to share knowledge and resources about how to keep students safe continue across Nashville schools. That includes hosting “know your rights” trainings and setting up tables on campus with information for students.

Clint Wilson, principal at Glencliff High School in South Nashville, said he has taken steps to protect students’ safety that he “never thought I would have to do.”

One day last spring, he started receiving reports that immigration enforcement was in the neighborhood. So he got in his truck after school and followed a bus to an apartment complex. He drove around the complex and waited until all the students were safely inside.

The school “never had the need to do anything like that before,” he said.

“I can’t promise a parent, but I can tell them we will do everything we can within our power legally to keep them protected here at school,” he said. “This is a safe place.”

At Glencliff, teachers have hosted trainings in partnership with community organizations, including a legislative advocacy session led by AWAKE and an informational session on the history of immigration in Tennessee led by EdTrust. They have organized adult Spanish classes, led by Voces de Nashville, so that teachers can better communicate with families.

Sam Singer, a literacy coach at Glencliff, said it would be “heartbreaking” if the “idea of school becomes a fearful one for families and for students.”

“It breaks that community trust that is what makes a civic society run,” she said.

Partly in response to the reported immigration activity in East Nashville last week, Glencliff teachers set up a “know your rights” table in the cafeteria on Monday. Materials included cards that state what students could say or do in encounters with immigration authorities, printed sheets to share with relatives and neighbors, and guidance for families on safety planning developed by the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.

Providing these materials also felt urgent to equip students to keep themselves and their neighbors safe during the upcoming winter break, when teachers “won’t have eyes on the kids every day,” Singer said.

MNPS spokesperson Sean Braisted told the Banner there have been no instances of attempted immigration enforcement on MNPS campuses this year.

Under district protocol, if immigration agents show up at a school they should be directed to a principal or administrator and asked to provide identification and legal documentation. Schools are required to contact the district’s legal team to review any documents or warrants. The district does not release student records or information without a court order or subpoena. ICE agents cannot speak with or remove a student from campus without legal authorization. The same protocol applies to school buses, according to Braisted.

“It’s a time that’s frightening for a lot of families,” Braisted said. “All we can do is reinforce the steps and protocols we have and help answer questions as it relates to what schools can and cannot do.”",https://i0.wp.com/nashvillebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dan-Mills-Elementary-03-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-16 23:58:40.432230

“… A visa issued to a nonimmigrant for admission to the United States pursuant to this subsection is colloquially referred to as an ‘F-1’ visa. …

“Accordingly, because Öztürk is likely to succeed on her claim that the government’s termination of her SEVIS record violated the APA, this factor weighs in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction. …

“The government contends that an injunction is not in the public interest, because of the government’s interest in immigration control. … The Court does not question that the government has multiple legitimate interests in the realm of immigration enforcement. … The government, however, directs the Court to no case recognizing an interest in enforcing immigration policy through unlawful means. … This Court joins others that have found, in cases involving SEVIS terminations like Öztürk’s, that the public interest and balance of equities favor the student. …

“For the reasons stated above, the Court shall grant Öztürk’s motion for preliminary injunction, D. 171.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced Washington sanctuary politicians refused to honor a detainer for Kamalpreet Singh, a criminal illegal alien truck driver from India, who caused a fatal multi-vehicle crash. Instead of honoring the ICE arrest detainer, these politicians chose to release this public safety threat back onto America’s roads.

According to local reports, on December 11, Singh failed to decelerate on a freeway in Washington State, striking the rear of another vehicle, pushing it into a third vehicle. The vehicle Singh directly hit caught on fire and the 29-year-old driver, Robert Pearson, died on the scene. Two vehicles were totaled, and one was left with major damage. The roadway was blocked for nearly 7 hours following the crash.

Singh illegally entered the U.S. in 2023 near Lukeville, Arizona, and was released into this country by the Biden administration.

“These demented and dangerous sanctuary policies have deadly consequences,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Robert Pearson would still be alive today if the Biden administration hadn’t released this illegal alien into our country. How many more Americans have to be killed before Democrat politicians start to put the public’s safety ahead of politics?""

In recent months, we’ve seen a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety and resulting in senseless loss of life.

Earlier this month, ICE lodged a detainer for Juan Hernandez-Santos, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who is accused of causing a wreck while driving an 18-wheeler that slammed into another vehicle, causing a six-car pile-up, including with a school bus, on the morning of December 4, 2025, in Lacey, Washington. Local authorities did not honor the ICE detainer due to sanctuary policies, and he was subsequently released from custody.

In November, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for Rajinder Kumar, a criminal illegal alien from India charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangering after he killed two people in Deschutes County, Oregon while driving a semi-truck.

In August, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a Harjinder Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, following his arrest for three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida.

In August, ICE arrested Partap Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, who caused a multi-car pileup while driving a commercial 18-wheeler in the sanctuary state of California. The accident left 5-year-old Dalilah Coleman with critical, life-altering injuries.

In October, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for Jashanpreet Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, who killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.

DHS law enforcement is protecting American communities every day from another senseless tragedy like this taking place in another town, to another family.

Horrible Attacks on Bondi Beach and at Brown University: The Casualties Mount, and the Issues Rage

The scene of horror unfolded in one of the iconic beaches of Australia over the weekend when two shooters began attacking a group of people gathered for a Hanukkah celebration, part of the Jewish community there. There were some other guests as well, but at least as of now, 16 persons were killed and several others were wounded.

The victims included a 10-year-old child, a little girl, along with a rabbi and a Holocaust survivor. Survived the Holocaust only to die in this onslaught that unfolded on Bondi Beach. We are looking here at something that is now becoming a pattern. Even a pattern of recent days, not to mention a pattern of years, and as I’m going to argue, a pattern of centuries. What we’re looking at here is a far bigger question than many people want to acknowledge. It has to do with the openness of Western societies. It has to do with the conflict between the West and Islam. It has to do with the practical problems of mass immigration. And there are very few who want to talk about these things out loud. I think that that is our responsibility.

Now, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal at least hinted at this in a piece they ran about various attacks and arrests made in various places. They mentioned not only the mass shooting there on Bondi Beach and Australia, aimed at the Jewish community, no question. And it is suspected that they were Islamic shooters, a father and a son.

And then you look at the fact that last Friday, German police arrested five men, three Moroccans, a Syrian, and an Egyptian, as The Journal said, “On suspicion of planning an attack on a Christmas market.” There are other things. And so you have other headlines that are all put together here, and you’re also looking at an attack that took place in Syria.

There are commonalities. One of the commonalities here is that you have an undeniable trend of antisemitism. It’s an ugly outbreak of antisemitism. And in this case, you have to say, “Is this politically occasioned?” I don’t think that’s a sufficient explanation. I think this is ancient hatreds. I don’t think this is just a modern development. And I think we’re going to fool ourselves and confuse ourselves if we see this as just a modern development.

I’m not going to go through all the headlines about all the attacks, all the outbreaks of antisemitism. I do want to go back to the three issues that I mentioned. We are looking at the fact that you have free societies that are increasingly unfree. And it is because you look at this, and even if the police declare that Bondi Beach is now fully open and that security concerns have been met.

And then you also have the president of Brown University having to respond to a mass shooting that took place. And it took place in a classroom with a Jewish professor. And in this case, they had a suspect. The suspect, we are told, is no longer a suspect, is now being released. That means that the suspect has not been found or located. And we’re looking at an undeniable pattern, and it is an assault upon the freedom of assembly. It’s an attack upon the freedom of free societies.

Karl Popper, 20th-century philosopher, spoke of the difference between open and closed societies. We could simply summarize it more or less in free and unfree societies. In a free society, in an open society, you have the ability, for instance, of Jewish citizens, friends, and family to gather on a public beach there in Sydney for a Hanukkah celebration. But the very fact that they were known to do that meant that they were also susceptible to the kind of planned, strategic, intentional, premeditated terror attack that was actually what happened there over the weekend on Bondi Beach and with such murderous results.

I don’t think most of us have come to terms with how this is happening so fast, even in the United States. Free assembly is actually being cut down, not so much by the government taking an unconstitutional action, but simply by the society itself becoming unsafe for that kind of assembly. Now, let me just tell you that on college campuses, the rules are constantly changing. Some of this is driven by DEI and all kinds of leftist ideologies. Some of it is taking place just out of a rational response to what could be defined as a clear and present danger.

So are ideological and political considerations here? Yeah. But whether you’re from the right or the left, the reality is the cost of holding a public event has gone skyrocketing high. You now have to arrange, in many cases, for security or for private police. You have to have screening. And yes, I think this has been disproportionate in terms of how it’s fallen out on the political spectrum. And you just have to think of the assassination of Charlie Kirk earlier this year to understand that that will require all the rules to be changed. Even if the rules aren’t changed, the insurance coverage will change. In other words, things are going to change whether or not universities and colleges initiate the changes. It’s going to happen.

And free expression, free assembly, the gathering of people together for the exchange of ideas, the ability of students to meet, the ability of just institutions to have any openness at all, to operate freely. How long is it going to be before every single school basically is behind some kind of military encampment? How long is it going to be before the cost of some kind of assembly in the public is simply going to be too high? How long is it going to be before, in effect, the freedom of Western societies disappears?

There are two other issues, and they’re going to require a lot of attention in coming weeks and months. As a matter of fact, I think we’re in a civilizational struggle, so these issues are going to continue for a considerable amount of time.

And one of them simply has to do with immigration. There is no way around it. This is a part of the picture there in Australia. It’s a part of the picture in so many of these attacks. It’s a part of the picture in so many nations. And you see a pushback on this across the political spectrum. And you also see it in some very unusual ways, perhaps you haven’t noticed. In the United States, for some time it was basically people on the Right who were making this case pretty loudly for restricting immigration. But you’ll notice that defenses of, say, open borders and all of this, which was a part of liberal discourse, that has gone dormant and at least softer. You don’t see many people even on the political Left or in the Washington spectrum, you don’t see many Democrats standing up and becoming vociferous, vocal, very loud defenders of unrestricted immigration. No. As a matter of fact, the Overton Window, as it’s called on that, has shifted significantly. The acceptable discourse now is what kind of appropriate immigration restrictions should be in place.

Now, one of the problems on the Left right now is that they will fight actually coming up with those restrictions. And a part of it is because their own coalitions are so fractured over these issues. Their movement on this is very, very limited. And yet the public eventually is going to demand a change to this situation.

That is happening in Western European nations. It has already been happening over the course of the last several years. It is a big issue in Germany right now. I mentioned the arrests of those who are suspected and coming from Islamic lands who were arrested in anticipation of the fact they were plotting a Christmas market attack.

Christmas markets, by the way, are an exercise in free economics, also free assembly and free expression there in Germany. They’re a very important part of the Christmas culture. And so this is an attack at the very heart of Germany, the very heart of German culture, the very idea of German liberty. And you see a clash here and immigration is a big part of this. And we have seen this, by the way, in previous attacks on Christmas markets in Germany. We’ve seen it so much so that I do not even dare right now to try to catalog them. The reality is the list is overwhelming.

The fact is that mass immigration, as many Western nations sought to undertake plans or policies acknowledged or unacknowledged on open immigration, they have led to disaster. Now, that’s not to say that they have led in every case to disaster. That would be an overclaim. It is to say the pattern itself has created a massive vulnerability within societies.

And one of the things that society requires, one of the things a civilization requires, is a commitment to the civilizational principle. And if you allow people who do not buy into, do not support, will not work towards your civilizational project, you’re in big trouble because you have just brought into your own country, you have just brought into your own culture, those who absolutely want to transform it, or at the very least, do not want to have anything to do with becoming a part of it.

And there’s more to this as we shall get to the issue of Islam, but on the issue of immigration, when you have immigrant communities that are multiple ethnics, that’s what some of the reference was to back in the 20th century. They simply do not become a part of the larger society. They see themselves as separate from it. That is a huge problem.

In Australia, over the course of the last 25 years, the percentage of the population who’ve been immigrants has increased from 23% to 34%. Okay, do the math, from 23% to 34%. That means that right now, one out of three persons legally in Australia is an immigrant. Now, that could be a good thing. I think we now know that’s not a good thing. It could be a good thing if all of those people, or even the vast, vast majority of those people, were absolutely committed to continuing the civilizational project of Australia, but we now know that is not the case. The civilizational project of Australia would include a welcome and protection of Jewish citizens there. We see that that is something this father and son definitely did not buy into.

Now, exactly what policy should a nation have? I believe a nation should have a national interest immigration policy. As a matter of fact, I’m going to argue that’s what is going to happen competently or incompetently in almost any situation. And so even when you look at Germany’s very open receptivity to a lot of migrants coming in, even from lands where they had very different civilizational commitments, coming in particular over the last 15 years, and specifically under the leadership of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, she claimed this is in Germany’s best interest as a matter of national honor. It’s really a matter of national duty.

And you see, when those arguments take place, as is clear in Germany right now, many of the politicians who put those policies in place, claiming this is right for Germany now, even over against overwhelming opposition in her own country, the fact is, as is the case with Angela Merkel, they’re generally retired from office before the consequences show up.

Part II

The Problem of Islam: This is Not Just a Problem of a Lack of Assimilation

But I have to get to the third issue here. It’s not just the loss of freedom in free societies. It’s not just the problem of immigration and the fact that incompetent, wrong, reckless immigration laws or the disregard of immigration laws leads to a civilizational crisis.

It is also, thirdly, that in this case, the specific crisis, we do know. We cannot honestly not know. Overwhelmingly, it is an Islamic crisis. Now, there are those who want to deny this, and they are absolutely determined to shut down any public conversation. And quite frankly, if you dare to talk about these things out loud, there are many people who are going to say, “You’re an Islamophobe.” That’s the current kind of language that’s being used.

But I want to go back to the fact that this isn’t personal. This is indeed civilizational. I am very indebted to Samuel Huntington back from the 20th century, and he made very clear that Islamic civilization is a very different civilization than Western civilization. It starts with a radically different theology, and it ends up with a radically different vision of society. And as a matter of fact, they’re so radically different, they’re irreconcilable.

And there are people who are going to counter that and say, “Well, look at Zohran Mamdani, very liberal, pro-LGBTQ, pro-abortion, pro all these things, and he’s a Muslim.” Yes, but I don’t think he’s a Muslim who could show up as a Muslim in Muslim-dominated countries and make his case.

That is to say, what we have in virtually all of the West are people who have accommodated themselves to a modernity and to secularism one way or the other. So you have liberal Jewish citizens. You have plenty of liberal people who identify as Christians, liberal denominations, liberal preachers, liberal bishops, and all the rest. They will endorse everything of the far left, but they don’t have any legitimate claim on Orthodox biblical historic Christianity.

And so you say, “Well, there are liberal Christians.” Yep. And you know what? In a Christian society, liberal Christians will show up in a way that’s not true about liberal Muslims in, well, you could name the country, especially in the Middle East, where let’s just say there is no real moderate Muslim population for good reason.

Now, we don’t have time to unpack all of this today, but we need to say enough, and we need to make very clear that a part of the central theological logic of Islam is territorial in a way that isn’t true of Christianity, has never been true of Christianity.

Where you have had, for instance, the claim that this is Christian territory, what it really means is this is where Christians constitute a majority and where a basic Christian understanding of human dignity and human law and all of this prevails. That’s very different than the Muslim understanding of territory, which means that in the Muslim worldview, the world is actually divided between the world of Islam and the world of war, where there is the responsibility of Muslims to wage the battle to bring those unconquered parts of the civilization under Muslim control, under the rule of the Quran. Now, there is no such thing when you look at Judaism or Christianity. It’s a very different logic, but then again, Muhammad was a very, very different founder.

And when it comes to people in the West, there once was a time when in the West you had people who were in office who understood the difference and understood the threat. But now you have an absolute naivete for decades on the part of many Western leaders who just assumed that everyone can be enticed to conform to a Western historic understanding of human rights, of the process of law, of the status of nations, of the ideal of citizenship and all the rest. Clearly, that isn’t true. It should have been clear at every single point.

And that is not to say there cannot be some persons who will identify as this or that who can blend in well in the United States. It is to say that we have a conflict of theologies, we have a conflict of worldviews, we have a conflict of civilizations, and to deny it is sheer idiocy. And it comes hand in hand, by the way, with those who are the cultured elites in the United States and Europe who want to suggest that Christianity had basically nothing to do with the formation of Western civilization, or that you can have a continuation of Western civilization with its understandings of human dignity and all the rest after having abandoned Christianity.

And the other thing to notice is that when Christianity is abandoned, it isn’t followed by a vacuum. That is impossible. It is followed by something stronger. When a weak theology abandons the ground, what follows is a strong theology. And understand this, Islam is a very strong theology.

All right, so many issues here for us to have to consider. Our hearts go out to the people of Australia and in particular to the Jewish community there, to students at Brown University and all involved. Unfortunately, the list is long, and the casualties mount, and the denial yet continues. It’s going to be very interesting to see where this conversation goes.

I’m not one to offer very many predictions, but I will say this, I don’t think this situation can remain as it is. You see right now enormous pushback in Western Europe simply because of those who are not assimilating into these societies. And over time, you had the liberals say, “Well, the society should feel guilty for the fact that this assimilation isn’t taking place.” No, that is not the fact. The problem here is not that the societies aren’t genuinely open. It is that there are so many people who genuinely do not want an open society.",https://cf.albertmohler.com/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2251954353.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 21:57:02.179797

Immigrant advocates say the law addresses real harm that has already occurred in Maine.","A bill aimed at preventing Maine law enforcement agencies from participating in federal immigration enforcement, LD 1971, will become law when the legislature reconvenes in January. But it won’t take effect until this summer.

Gov. Janet Mills announced this week that she will allow it to take effect without her signature. It will take effect 90 days after lawmakers adjourn the session, which is currently scheduled to end April 15.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Deqa Dhalac, said the measure is urgently needed to protect Maine’s immigrant communities at a time of escalating immigration enforcement and growing fear.

“I appreciate that Gov. Mills will allow LD 1971 to become law, but I am disappointed that she decided to wait this long,” Dhalac said. She added that local police departments helping ICE “damages their relationship with immigrant communities, erodes public trust and makes us all less safe, whether we are immigrants or not.”

As amended, LD 1971 clarifies that state and local law enforcement agencies may not engage in federal immigration enforcement, while still allowing cooperation with federal authorities on investigations into serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking. LD 1971 passed in both Maine’s House of Representatives and Senate in the spring.

Immigrant advocates say the law addresses real harm that has already occurred in Maine. The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP) has tracked at least 22 minor traffic stops since March 2025 in which people were handed over to immigration authorities based on suspected immigration status alone, including passengers, bystanders, children and accident victims. Many of those individuals were known to be in lawful immigration processes and had no criminal histories.

“In addition to protecting the rights and safety of Maine residents, this law sends a far-reaching message that immigrants are valued, respected, and needed,” said Lisa Parisio, ILAP’s policy director, “and that our collective voices and communities are powerful and we can make change.”

The law also bars Maine jails from holding people past their release dates based on ICE detainers, which are nonmandatory requests that courts have found to be unconstitutional.",https://mainebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0540-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 21:57:10.000852

“Alejandra Milagros De La Cruz-Quispe (‘De La Cruz’), a native and citizen of Peru, petitions for review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’) dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s (‘IJ’) denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). … We deny the petition because substantial evidence supports the agency’s determinations and there were no errors of law. …

“… De La Cruz described a long and turbulent relationship with her ex-partner, Mauro. …

“In February or March 2012, De La Cruz reported Mauro to the police but was later told there was no record of her complaint. When she went to file a second report in September 2012, Mauro was waiting for her at the station, and he kicked and punched her once they got away from the building. The beatings and sexual violence escalated. When she again returned to her parents’ home, Mauro came with his uncle, a police officer, and threatened to kill her and take their daughter if De La Cruz did not return to him. It is unclear whether she indeed returned to him before she decided to leave Peru and traveled alone to the United States, leaving behind her daughter, whom she says she could not afford to bring.

“Mauro’s conduct formed the basis for De La Cruz’s assertions that she had suffered past persecution and faced a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her membership in twelve proposed particular social groups (‘PSGs’), as well as a fear of future torture if removed to Peru. She supplemented her applications with country conditions evidence indicating the persistence of violence against women in Peru. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that the IJ did not clearly err in finding that De La Cruz failed to establish the required nexus, even under a mixed motive theory. The record, largely comprised of De La Cruz’s own statements, shows that Mauro’s abuse arose from intensely personal disputes within the relationship. The evidence certainly does not compel a finding that ‘the scope of [any] persecution extends beyond a ‘personal vendetta.’‘ …

“Contrary to De La Cruz’s contention, both the IJ and the BIA accurately recited and applied the ‘one central reason’ mixed motive standard. Nothing in their decisions indicates that they ‘prematurely terminate[d] the analysis upon the finding of another motive.’ … Nor did the BIA apply the wrong standards of review: it properly reviewed the IJ’s motive findings for clear error and legal issues de novo, as its decision states. …

“As De La Cruz failed to show that the record compels a finding of the requisite nexus between her alleged persecution and any statutorily protected ground, her claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that the IJ did not clearly err in finding De La Cruz’s fear of future torture speculative and insufficient to establish the likelihood of torture required for CAT protection. As the BIA noted, De La Cruz testified that she does not know Mauro’s current whereabouts and did not otherwise substantiate her concerns that he will rape, torture, or kill her upon her return to Peru. …”

Gov. Maura Healey demanded that ICE stop using Hanscom Field in Bedford for immigration enforcement flights in a recent letter to federal authorities.

The move comes as the Trump administration continues to escalate mass deportation efforts using contracted planes throughout the country. In November, ICE conducted the most flights of any month since at least January 2020, according to recent data released by a prominent human rights group that tracks the flights.

Healey called ICE’s deportation tactics “disturbing and anti-American” in her letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE. She accused ICE of using the flights to “sever” immigrants from their friends and family without due process.

During a major enforcement operation in Massachusetts in September, 63% of the immigrants arrested by ICE had no criminal charges, according to recent reporting from The New York Times that Healey cited. Only 10% had any past criminal conviction, and only 2% had a past violent conviction.

According to ICE, the September operation resulted in 1,406 “illegal alien offenders” being arrested. More than 600 of these people “had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives,” according to the agency. Federal officials issued multiple statements about the purported public safety improvements that will come from these arrests. They highlighted a handful of “the worst of the worst,” detainees who had violent criminal histories, but did not share detailed information about all the immigrants arrested during the operation.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

In her letter, Healey defended the many immigrants being swept up in enforcement operations who are law-abiding residents.

“They are hard-working, productive, and beloved members of our community that you have indiscriminately targeted for deportation proceedings. Many of them are in the midst of a lawful process seeking citizenship through Massachusetts courts. This doesn’t make our communities safer – it in fact makes us all less safe,” Healey wrote.

Last week immigration enforcement officers disrupted naturalization ceremonies at Faneuil Hall in Boston, abruptly pulling some green card holders who were on the verge of gaining citizenship out of line. This was reportedly done based on their country of origin. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu convened a press conference inside Faneuil Hall this week to harshly condemn the cancellations, saying that they “disturbing to the utmost degree.”

Between the beginning of this year and Nov. 30, there were 114 ICE flights that departed from Hanscom, according to a report from Human Rights First. This represents a 143% increase from the same period in 2024.

ICE does not own planes, but contracts with an airline broker that in turn subcontracts to several airline carriers for the flights, according to the group, which maintains a detailed “ICE Flight Monitor.” ICE also uses Air Force and, increasingly, Coast Guard planes.

ICE acts quickly, often flying detainees to detention centers and staging areas around the country before they are actually deported. Immigration lawyers have accused the agency of intentionally misleading them and restricting access to their clients.

Last month, a freshman at Babson College was stopped at Logan Airport, flown to Texas, and ultimately deported to Honduras within two days. Her lawyer says this was done in violation of a court order.

Human Rights First documented a sharp increase in the number of domestic transfer flights this year. November saw a record 1,026 domestic ICE flights nationally.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey wrote.

The Washington Post recently reported that the Trump administration will spend $140 million to purchase six Boeing 737 planes for deportations.

The total number of ICE flights has also increased steadily this year. In January, the agency only oversaw 534 flights. In November, there were 1,538, according to Human Rights First.

The city council’s decision does not remove Key Lime Air from the airport.
Key Lime has come under scrutiny in the past few months after news of their work with ICE came to light.
Protests earlier this month were held at Colorado University, Boulder, which contracts with Key Lime to transport some of its athletic teams.
“Rejecting the lease actually saves money for Key Lime Air because they will continue to fly out of DIA, and continue to use the common area for free,” he said.","Key Lime did not immediately return a request for comment.

It was a provocative action for a city under President Donald Trump, who has sought to punish cities and states led by Democrats that have challenged his policies on immigration.

ICE is largely beyond the jurisdiction of state and local authorities, forcing officials to seek alternative ways to express opposition such as California’s adoption of a ban on face coverings by law enforcement. In Portland, Oregon, the City Council earlier this month adopted an ordinance that would penalize ICE for deploying tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Denver’s decision.

The city council’s decision does not remove Key Lime Air from the airport. While it will not be granted a larger operating space, it will still have access to the common areas it already uses.

“It is more symbolic,” Councilmember Flor Alvidrez told POLITICO on Tuesday. “It sends a message to the airport that we are not going to support [Key Lime] going into the future, and also makes whatever business they’re doing more inconvenient.”

Denver’s actions could have consequences: City Council members said that rejecting Key Lime’s request because of its ICE activity could put nearly $90 million of the Denver Airport’s federal grants in jeopardy. A condition of the funding is that all airlines are treated the same by the airport.

The Denver airport is owned and operated by the city of Denver, but has its own CEO who reports to Mayor Mike Johnston, who declined to comment on the council decision. Airport officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Key Lime has come under scrutiny in the past few months after news of their work with ICE came to light. Protests earlier this month were held at Colorado University, Boulder, which contracts with Key Lime to transport some of its athletic teams.

Alvidrez said these protests contributed to the City Council’s decision, and said she hopes the city council’s actions will send a message to all airlines that contracting with ICE could damage their relationship with progressive cities.

The single vote in favor of Key Lime’s lease came from City Councilmember Kevin Flynn, who told POLITICO Tuesday he disagrees with the immigration enforcement that Key Lime participates in, but added that rejecting the lease actually makes things easier for the airline.

“Rejecting the lease actually saves money for Key Lime Air because they will continue to fly out of DIA, and continue to use the common area for free,” he said. “It made sense to me to start charging them.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4e%2F6c%2F0d9eb734413ea16c9365d6719103%2Fdistrict-of-columbia-66245.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 18:57:53.755862

December 16, 2025 5:00 pm

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed H.R. 4371, which would subject unaccompanied immigrant children to invasive body searches and prolonged immigration detention, preventing their release to loved ones in the U.S. Though the bill was narrowly passed, dozens of members who previously voted for extreme bills expanding mandatory detention rejected this dangerous bill, signaling a growing shift against the Trump administration’s extreme anti-immigrant agenda.

If passed in the Senate, the bill would represent a major expansion of the Trump administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda. It would also lead to serious — and potentially permanent — psychological harm to children. Over the last several weeks, this administration has attempted to cut legal services for children who came alone to the U.S. and to coerce them into abandoning their due process and anti-trafficking protections.

In response to this news, Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs, Equality division at the American Civil Liberties Union, had the following reaction:

“H.R. 4371 would be a callous expansion of President Trump’s cruel detention agenda, targeting vulnerable children. This bill masquerades as protective legislation but would instead subject children to physical and psychological harm.

“While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. Now more than ever, we need our elected officials to speak out against the Trump administration’s attempts to strip children of their rights and dignity, and to disappear them into detention.”

According to the court rules, agents can enter court lockups to take people into custody, but court staff cannot assist in, nor impede ICE arrests.
ICE reported the highest number of Massachusetts district court arrests in Lynn, Woburn, Framingham and Waltham.
He recounted seeing at least a dozen ICE arrests over the last few months as people left in cars or on foot.
The group’s volunteers have witnessed dozens of ICE arrests in Waltham, Paz said.","Immigration enforcement agents have become a common fixture around courthouses in Massachusetts this year — plainclothes officers idle outside in black cars, chat with clerks and monitor hearings to find people to arrest.

While lawyers say U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has long apprehended immigrants at courthouses, the numbers have ballooned under the second Trump administration.

In the past, “You didn't have a sense that immigration was always in the building. Now it's like that's the first thing you think about,” said public defender Antonio Vincenty.

The increased presence is not only in federal courts, but also at dozens of district courthouses in the state. Vincenty handles cases in East Boston, Chelsea and downtown Boston, and said he has had three clients arrested in court this year.

“We want those that commit crimes to be punished. I don't think any criminal lawyer feels differently,” Vincenty said. “But we want the system to work. We want the system to live up to its rules — to treat people with fairness, to treat people with justice and due process.”

Courthouse arrests in Massachusetts have surged nearly three-fold over Trump’s first nine months in office, according to ICE data compiled by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.

A WBUR analysis of the data found 386 arrests at 46 courts across the state — including 147 at the federal courthouse in Boston — from January through mid-October. That’s up from 131 over the same period last year under the Biden administration.

And the latest data is almost certainly an undercount. In East Boston, for instance, ICE recorded only six courthouse arrests, while lawyers and immigration advocates report having seen far more.

Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said ICE activity has impacted hundreds of cases prosecuted by his office — noting instances in which defendants got detained during proceedings, as well as times when victims and witnesses were afraid to cooperate because of agents' presence.

“The ultimate concern is that it has a chilling effect on our ability to deliver public safety for victims and witnesses of crime,” Hayden said.

He acknowledged ICE has legal authority to operate in courts here, but, ""Do I wish they would stay out of our courthouses?"" he said. ""Absolutely.”

""Do I wish they would stay out of our courthouses? ... Absolutely.”

Assistance for ICE in East Boston

With immigration enforcement mounting, the Massachusetts Trial Court released a policy in May on how court staff are to interact with ICE. Court officers must provide public information to agents when asked — as that information is available to the public — but they can’t initiate communication with ICE.

According to the court rules, agents can enter court lockups to take people into custody, but court staff cannot assist in, nor impede ICE arrests. That was put to the test on the afternoon of Nov. 21 in East Boston — in an alley behind the district court — after Alejandro Orrego Agudelo’s arraignment.

Video taken by an immigration advocate in East Boston and shared with WBUR showed Orrego on the ground — shirtless, barefoot and shackled. Orrego cried out for help as two agents in black hoodies and blue jeans struggled to control him.

A crowd began to form, and a court officer in a white shirt and court badge helped the agents subdue the 27-year-old. At one point, the officer helped shove him into the back of a black SUV.

A woman in the crowd shouted: “Where are you taking him? He was released in court.”

One of the agents responded: “He needs to go to immigration court.”

Sandy Wright, a volunteer with the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, was off camera, challenging the second court officer: “Who do you work for? Are you Trial Court? I thought you’re not supposed to be cooperating with ICE.”

In the video, a second court officer stood before the crowd with her hand up, signaling the crowd to stop, and made a phone call: “This is East Boston district court, we need assistance from Boston Police Department. We have ICE here collecting somebody and we have a large crowd.”

Nine Boston police officers arrived on the scene that day. The police report said Orrego was “violently resisting the agent.” The video showed him struggling, with his hands and feet cuffed.

Orrego was in court facing charges that included assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest, as well as malicious destruction of property and disturbing the peace. He’d been arrested that morning after a neighbor called police to report an altercation with him. A communication with court officials shared with WBUR says ICE had a “detainer” to take him into custody.

But the incident represented a violation of the Massachusetts Trial Court's policy not to help in an ICE arrest, according to Trial Court spokeswoman Jennifer Donahue.

She said in a statement, “Measures are being taken to address this violation.”

Donahue said the East Boston incident prompted the Court’s security leadership to meet with court officers across the state to reinforce its policy to neither help nor impede ICE arrests. She would not say if anyone has been disciplined for the violation.

The Executive Office of the Trial Court declined requests to interview Chief Justice of the Trial Court Heidi Brieger, who oversees all departments, and Trial Court Administrator Thomas Ambrosino.

Some scoff at measures that limit collaboration between court staff and ICE.

Retired ICE agent Albert Orlowski worked in immigration enforcement for more than two decades. He questioned how court officers could stand by while federal agents struggle to apprehend someone who’s resisting.

“Law enforcement agencies should cooperate with each other,” Orlowski said. “Assisting another officer — that's called professional courtesy.”

The rationale for courthouse arrests is clear, Orlowski explained: It’s an obvious place to find people facing criminal charges, and it's safer than most locations, as suspects typically have had to pass through metal detectors.

“It's so much easier to arrest somebody from a courthouse — when they're in a controlled environment — than it is to arrest somebody out on the street,” Orlowski said.

Spokespeople for Boston-area ICE and the Department of Homeland Security in Washington D.C. did not respond to requests for comment.

Evading ICE at courthouses

In a separate incident at East Boston District Court in late November, an 18-year-old high school student appeared for a summons. WBUR is referring to him by his middle name, Josué, as he fears retaliation by ICE.

Josué said the judge first heard the cases of non-Latinos, then called matters involving Latinos, all of whom spoke Spanish and required an interpreter. That’s when ICE agents showed up.

Local advocates outside the courthouse that day said ICE arrested at least two people during the proceedings. Josué said as he waited for his case to be called, he could hear the commotion and it was clear people were being grabbed as they left the court. He said he was afraid the agents would arrest him.

“For sure,” he said in Spanish. “But thank God, no.”

Josué said he’s undocumented and has been in the U.S. since he was 15.

When he walked out of the courthouse, Josué said the agents were distracted detaining someone else, and he managed to get into a car waiting around the block. Now he’s trying to keep his head down — he wants to finish high school, and not think too much about getting sent back to Honduras.

“God willing, that won’t happen,” he said.

ICE reported the highest number of Massachusetts district court arrests in Lynn, Woburn, Framingham and Waltham. At the Waltham District Court, west of Boston, an auto repair shop has a front row seat on the action.

Manuel Arias owns the shop across from the courthouse. He recounted seeing at least a dozen ICE arrests over the last few months as people left in cars or on foot. Arias said his staff filmed a number of the arrests, but they’ve become so commonplace that the mechanics stopped taking video.

“The way people have been grabbed has been savage,” Arias said in Spanish. Often, multiple agents grabbed a single person, he said.

In one case, a man bolted from the courthouse, he recalled, then ran across a busy intersection and got away.

Video from Arias, reviewed by WBUR, showed an agent giving chase, then giving up after the man jumps over a guardrail.

Calls for more restrictions on ICE activity in courthouses

In front of the Waltham courthouse steps, there are signs taped to lampposts: “ICE took our neighbor from this spot.”

“Unfortunately our courthouse has become an ICE trap,” said Jonathan Paz, founder of a group called Fuerza Community Defense Network, which monitors ICE activity in the city.

The group’s volunteers have witnessed dozens of ICE arrests in Waltham, Paz said. And in his view, the court system is bolstering the work of agents.

“Why [are] our taxpayer dollars, here in Massachusetts, being used to facilitate and better carry out these arrests in our courthouse?” Paz said.

""It's remarkable to see just how complicit this whole system is.”

This week, the 32-year-old Waltham resident announced he’s running for Congress. He’s among those calling on the state to put more limits on ICE activity at courthouses.

Paz said he’s waiting for the Trial Court — or the Legislature, or the governor or the attorney general — to keep ICE from interfering with people’s legal proceedings. They can’t stop agents from being on court property, but they can take steps to help people have their day in court without fear of being arrested.

ICE’s policy on courthouse arrests dictates that agents must observe local laws. Some states require agents to present judicial warrants; Massachusetts requires only a form known as a detainer, signed by an ICE officer.

State Sen. Lydia Edwards, of East Boston, co-chairs the Legislature’s judiciary committee. She said she’s in contact with court officials about the spate of ICE arrests, and is considering whether to propose rules requiring agents to present a warrant signed by a judge. A similar initiative was recently enacted in Illinois, as well as in Connecticut.

“While we require a civil detainer, I think it's worth us talking to the courts about what it means to require a judicial warrant,” Edwards said.

Edwards said any solution — even a state law — should have buy-in from court officials if it’s going to be properly implemented.

Another suggestion, she said, is to broaden access to remote hearings. Not having to go to a courthouse means ICE can’t arrest you there.

“I would love nothing more than for our courts to be a welcoming, safe place for justice, regardless of your immigration status,” she said. “That's what I want.”

As the New York Times reported, through a little-known arrangement between the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and ICE, passenger information from domestic flights is being shared with immigration agents, who can then snatch people from our airports, even those with various types of status that have protected them from these very actions in the past. It also marks a wider threat to all travelers’ civil liberties, due process and privacy rights.

The program, which began earlier this year without public notice, has already resulted in multiple detentions and rapid deportations, including 19-year-old college student Any Lucía López Belloza who was detained at Boston Logan Airport while attempting to travel home to spend Thanksgiving with her family. Any was deported to Honduras just two days later, despite a court order barring her removal. Additionally, DACA recipient Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago was similarly targeted at the airport while boarding a domestic flight and later detained for weeks despite her valid DACA status. The policy signals a sharp expansion of federal surveillance and coordination to expedite deportations.

In response to this news, United We Dream released the following statement:

“By quietly handing travelers’ information to immigration agents, the government is converting airports into ambush points where students, workers, and families can be detained without warning and stripped of any meaningful chance to defend themselves.”

“This is not about safety or security, it’s about supercharging an unpopular mass deportation agenda that prioritizes cruelty over humanity and due process. The simple act of traveling within the country should not lead to detention and exile. It is disgraceful that young college students like Any Lucía López Belloza, who was trying to return home to see her family for the holidays, can be detained at the gate and deported within days.”

“We’re seeing in real time how extreme deportation quotas are exploiting databases, expanding surveillance, and targeting communities across the country, including many U.S. citizens. United We Dream will not stay silent while the communities who power this country are attacked. We call on Congress to pass permanent protections so immigrant youth and families can travel and live with dignity, instead of fear.”",https://unitedwedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-UnitedWeDream-Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-16 17:57:37.114865

Beth Davis, the communications lead for Indivisible NOLA, remembers getting an Instagram direct message in November from someone with Indivisible Chicago that she didn’t know.
This has turned out to be a boon as street vendors, many of whom are immigrants, find themselves increasingly under threat from ICE raids.
In LA, as in many cities, ICE hotlines where people can call in sightings have been crucial for dispatching volunteers quickly.
“These occupations will go on to other cities, but we are learning more with each city, and cities are becoming more united every step of the way.”","When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) set its sights on Chicago in September, Chicagoans sprang into action to protect their immigrant neighbors: teaching each other how to recognize and safely document ICE agents, setting up “know your rights” trainings, and distributing whistles en masse so people could loudly alert anyone in the vicinity when ICE was spotted.

In the months since, whistles have become a popular raid alert tool in other cities across the country – New Yorkers wear them around their necks to warn neighbors, the people of New Orleans blast them outside ICE facilities and Charlotte residents used them to ward off Customs and Border Protection officials. While strongly associated with Chicago, the tactic is actually one that city organizers learned in part from groups in Los Angeles. Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.

Rain Skau, a co-coordinator of the Fight Fascism campaign of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles, said Angelenos began to use whistles to alert neighbors about ICE presence when agents first started hitting the city in June. Despite the federal government’s claims that these raids were targeting hardened criminals, Skau described one of the first raids at a Home Depot as mostly snatching women vending food in the parking lot, stuffing them into vans as meat sizzled on the grills they left behind.

DSA and other grassroots groups in the city set up patrols of ordinary citizens to create a consistent presence at the Home Depots when day laborers and vendors were most likely to be out and about. (A September report by Rent Brigade found that Home Depot locations became “the most dangerous places in LA for immigrant workers”.) Volunteers passed out “know your rights” information, and when a tip came via a citywide hotline about an ICE sighting, the groups sent out patrols to document what was happening, collect belongings and get in touch with family members if someone had already been detained.

By the time ICE hit the streets of Chicago in the fall, organizers in Los Angeles felt like they had some wisdom to share. Members of DSA in LA began having informal conversations with those in DSA Chicago. “One comment that someone made was, ‘We’ve never done anything like this before,’” Rain remembered. “And what I said to them was: ‘We hadn’t either, before all this happened. We had never operated ICE watch patrols, but we were able to do it. And here’s the great thing: you don’t have to do it alone. You don’t have to figure out all of this from scratch, because we’re here to support you.’”

Sharing resistance tactics between cities

As ICE kidnappings spread across the country, so has this spirit of solidarity. Beth Davis, the communications lead for Indivisible NOLA, remembers getting an Instagram direct message in November from someone with Indivisible Chicago that she didn’t know. “I’ve heard rumors that ICE may be headed to New Orleans as early as Friday. Our chapters in Chicago are wondering if we can provide you with support and resources based on what we’ve been through,” the message read.

Though Indivisible is a national organization, this connection wasn’t orchestrated by national leadership – just organizers in one city taking initiative to reach out to those in another. “For an individual chapter that is eight states away to reach out is very unusual,” Davis said. “There just really hasn’t ever been a need before now.”

She quickly connected leaders from the Chicago chapter to those in New Orleans. Before long, Indivisible Chicago had sent whistle kits in the mail to the New Orleans chapter, along with an explanation of how best to use them, and Indivisible NOLA set up a “know your rights” training that the Chicago Indivisible chapter helped lead remotely via Zoom. About 800 people spanning a wide range of ages and ethnicities showed up at a music venue for the New Orleans training, pens and paper in hand for note-taking.

Another collaborator on the “know your rights” training was the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), where cross-city collaboration has long been a practice, sometimes orchestrated by national leadership. “It’s sort of a chain reaction,” said Sarah Whittington, the advocacy director for ACLU Louisiana. Lessons learned on the ground were passed from ACLU Chicago to North Carolina to Louisiana branches.

“Those relationships across state lines have been really important,” Whittington said. “We’re building depth and expertise. If Minneapolis-St Paul is the next place, I don’t doubt that we will be reaching out to Minnesota and saying: ‘Hey, here’s what we did.’”

It’s not just national groups like the ACLU that are leveraging longstanding relationships. Groups representing street vendors in different cities got connected in the early days of the pandemic as they faced similar health and safety challenges across the country, and many have stayed in touch since. This has turned out to be a boon as street vendors, many of whom are immigrants, find themselves increasingly under threat from ICE raids.

In New York, vendors have faced increased surveillance from the police and sanitation department under mayor Eric Adams. But while the guidance for dealing with local law enforcement is that vendors should show their identification, the guidance for dealing with ICE is to remain silent. As a result, it has become crucial for street vendors to be able to differentiate between city and federal agents. Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, the deputy director of the Street Vendor Project, says the organization is preparing for the potential for increased raids by distributing whistle kits, based on advice from colleagues in Chicago.

“We’ve continued to be in touch throughout this time and build on those partnerships, just checking in with each other and asking: ‘What are you seeing on the ground?’” she said. “It’s also become like an emotional support group at times.”

Overcoming communication and surveillance challenges

These ongoing relationships and direct lines of communication are especially crucial because “the repression is so strong” that it can be hard to talk publicly about strategies and tactics via mainstream news broadcasts or social media, according to Phoebe Unterman, an organizer with the Echo Park local chapter of the Los Angeles Tenants Union.

While there was a burst of media coverage when ICE first began targeting Los Angeles, most of that (with the notable exception of independent outlet LA Taco) has dropped off even as the raids have continued, Unterman said, making it hard to stay on top of what is really happening in far-flung corners of her own city, much less another across the country. In LA, as in many cities, ICE hotlines where people can call in sightings have been crucial for dispatching volunteers quickly. But in places where that tip system is operating via large Signal groups or WhatsApp chats, infiltration by authorities is a risk.

Tenant unions in LA and beyond have thus relied on existing relationships to share what they’re seeing directly with organizers in other places. A lot of what works, they say, is having decentralized “cells” of volunteers across neighborhoods who can respond to tips about ICE sightings and get on the scene right away, since federal agents often conduct their snatch-and-grab campaigns in minutes. “The thing in all cities that seems to actually interrupt raids the most is when a neighborhood kind of spontaneously erupts and people are coming out in support of people [being detained],” said Unterman. “That has really scared ICE.”

None of the responses can totally shut down ICE’s ability to operate or end the raids, and just as organizers’ responses are evolving, so are ICE’s tactics. But one thing the organizers can agree on is that they’re better equipped to handle it all when they band together.

“There is something going on here, with all of these cities coming together and protecting our democracy, in a way that I don’t know that I have witnessed in my lifetime,” said Davis of Indivisible. “These occupations will go on to other cities, but we are learning more with each city, and cities are becoming more united every step of the way.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eff2df88048d62055db4cbbbf0a1e4884f1ef56/1131_0_6535_5229/master/6535.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c32a5a476e7f17ef0072fe7845787bd8",N,,2025-12-16 18:58:22.410930

But hours after he rejected any House action — and after a meeting with moderate Republicans who had publicly blasted him — Mr. Johnson suggested the decision had not yet been made, as lawmakers tried to craft a proposal that would appease more conservative members of the party.

“There’s a real possibility to get a vote on it,” Mr. Johnson said. “I’ve certainly tried my best to provide for that, so we’ll see what happens.”

His waffling was the latest sign of deep disarray in G.O.P. ranks over health care, an issue that Democrats have promised to make a centerpiece of their midterm election campaigns.

Most Republicans are vehemently opposed to the Affordable Care Act, but they have not been able to coalesce around a plan to replace it. And a small group of Republicans from swing districts, alarmed about the political consequences of allowing the subsidies to expire, had been urging Mr. Johnson to allow a vote on allowing them to continue at some level, at least temporarily.

After he ruled it out publicly on Tuesday, they made their displeasure with the speaker’s decision known.

“It’s idiotic,” Representative Mike Lawler of New York, who represents a suburban swing district, told reporters, adding that the decision was “political malpractice.”

Mr. Lawler was among the Republicans who met with Mr. Johnson before the speaker said a vote was still possible.

The fate of the subsidies was all but sealed last week, after the Senate deadlocked on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to extend them. With lawmakers expecting to depart Washington at the end of this week, there was little practical time left.

Then, Mr. Johnson on Friday released a narrow health care bill that did not address the subsidies. The moderates’ proposal to extend them had been expected to be brought to the floor as an amendment to that measure.

But on Tuesday morning, Mr. Johnson said that Republicans had been discussing the details, including how to pay for an extension, and could not reach an agreement to allow that vote to proceed.

“We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference.

Even if the moderates’ proposal were to make it to the floor, it appears unlikely to pass. But the effort would give Republicans campaigning for re-election a way to show they had tried to protect the subsidies.

Some Republican lawmakers have backed two separate discharge petitions that would force a vote on the matter.

But both petitions would need the support of 218 members of the House to succeed. Democrats have instead been circulating a petition to force a vote on their plan to extend the subsidies for three years, but they would need the backing of at least a handful of Republicans. Even if any of those measures were to draw sufficient support this week, they would not come to the floor before the end of the year, when the subsidies expire.

Some of the moderate Republicans said they would propose their measures as amendments later Tuesday at a meeting of the powerful Rules Committee, which determines which legislation and amendments can come to a vote. But Mr. Johnson controls the committee, which does not have any members from that centrist faction.

In the Senate, a bipartisan group of about 20 lawmakers met Monday night to see if they could find agreement on a way forward on the subsidies, with an eye toward trying to advance legislation in January.

Organizers of the group said there appeared to be an early consensus to extend the tax credits for two years, scaling them back during the second. The group hoped to issue a legislative framework before leaving for the holidays.

“This was a very constructive meeting,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of those who put the meeting together. She said the group was united in trying to “prevent huge spikes in insurance premiums that will make insurance unaffordable for lower and middle-income Americans.”

Ms. Collins added: “The fact that the enhanced premium tax credits are going to expire hits hard.”

“Of course, we’re not going to release a top-secret, full unedited video of that to the general public,” Mr. Hegseth said after the meeting with senators, which was held in the secure briefing room designed to handle top-secret intelligence.

The briefings unfolded as members of both parties have raised questions about the nature and legality of the attacks at sea, and expressed concern that they were not being given adequate information about them.

President Trump has claimed the strikes are aimed at targeting narco-traffickers seeking to bring fentanyl, which he described this week as a weapon of mass destruction, into the United States. But lawmakers have repeatedly been told that the boats the military has struck since September were carrying cocaine, not fentanyl.

There have also been escalating questions about the rules of engagement for the operation, including the legality of the first attack, which included a second strike to kill survivors.

Earlier this month, a small group of congressional leaders and senior lawmakers viewed video of the Sept. 2 strike that showed a fiery explosion that destroyed most of a vessel in the Caribbean Sea. As the smoke cleared from the first strike, two survivors could be seen clinging to the hull of the capsized vessel, trying unsuccessfully to flip it and climb on top.

It was in that moment, according to lawmakers and congressional staff who saw the video or were briefed on it, that the commander of the operation gave the order to hit the boat a second time, killing the two men.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, was among the lawmakers who saw the unedited footage; he said he had asked Mr. Hegseth to allow all lawmakers to see it.

“He said he’d think about it,” Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday. He added that instead, Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Rubio, who is the acting national security adviser, “came to this briefing empty-handed.”

“If they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?” he added. “Every senator is entitled to see it.”

Most Republicans exiting the briefing backed the Trump administration’s decision to limit access, citing concerns about the sensitivity of the classified video.

“If you don’t like the classification, talk to the White House about it,” Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said after the meeting.

Mr. Trump initially said he had “no problem” publishing the video of the follow-up strike, but he has since reversed himself, leaving lawmakers in both parties frustrated about the lack of transparency.

Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would try to force the issue by seeking to quickly pass legislation that would require the Defense Department to release the video publicly.

“I found the legal explanations and strategic explanations incoherent,” Mr. Schiff said of the briefing. “But I think the American people should see this video and all members of Congress should have that opportunity. I certainly want it for myself.”

Mr. Schiff and others’ effort would need to surmount considerable obstacles as Republicans continue to defer to the Pentagon and Mr. Hegseth’s decision to closely guard access to it. The annual defense policy bill expected to pass this week includes a provision that seeks to compel the administration to give Congress unedited video of the strikes as well as the execute orders that initiated the campaign. Mr. Hegseth did not respond to questions about whether he intends to comply with the demand.

Speaker Mike Johnson declared after exiting the briefing that the United States was engaged in a “noninternational armed conflict.” He echoed the legal rationale the Justice Department laid out in a memo that concluded that extrajudicial killings of people suspected of running drugs were lawful as a matter of Mr. Trump’s wartime powers.

Mr. Johnson said the cartels “operate with impunity, engage in violence and terrorism that presents a clear and present danger to the security of America and threaten other nations in our hemisphere.” The speaker added that Mr. Trump “has both the authority and the obligation” to strike the suspected drug boats.

Mr. Trump has designated certain cartels as terrorist organizations, and many Republicans argued that the strikes were lawfully targeting members of those organizations or people tied to them.

But Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, one of the few Republicans to call for the Pentagon to show lawmakers the unedited video of the Sept. 2 strike, said Congress was still trying to discern whether the attacks were lawful.

The Trump administration, he said, must “still deal with the reality that the vast majority of the drugs that are coming in and killing people, particularly fentanyl, is coming across the southern border.”

Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump must make the request for Congress to authorize the offensive.

“We spent 20 years without debate, without the authorizations, without the oversight,” added Mr. Crow, who deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq. “We’ve seen how this turns out. It doesn’t work out well.”

House Democrats plan to force a vote on two separate measures later this week aimed at stopping Mr. Trump from carrying out additional attacks on boats at sea or striking targets inside Venezuela without express approval from Congress. They mirror similar attempts in the Senate to force Republicans to go on the record on the campaign that has to date struck 25 vessels and killed 95 people.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing Georgia Republican who is resigning in January, said that she had signed on to one of the efforts to assert congressional authority under the War Powers Act. But she signaled on Tuesday that she might be reconsidering, saying she “was very impressed by the briefing we got today.”

In a social media post, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which has carried out the negotiations, said the European Union and some member states had “persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against American companies.

The United States had raised concerns with the European Union about these issues for years “without meaningful engagement,” all while allowing European companies to operate freely in the United States, it said. If the European Union continues these policies, the United States will “have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the U.S.T.R. said. It named fees and restrictions on service companies among the possibilities, and said it would use the same approach against other countries that echoed Europe’s strategy.

The post singled out potential European service providers that could be targeted by name, listing Accenture, DHL, Mistral, SAP, Siemens and Spotify, among others.

American officials have long been frustrated by the European Union’s role as the world’s most aggressive regulator of the tech industry. But in threatening such direct retaliation, the Trump administration is going much further to get officials in Brussels to back down.

“Our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the E.U.,” Thomas Regnier, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in response to the post. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination.”

He added that the bloc will “continue to engage” with the United States on implementing their trade deal.

European authorities have in recent months signaled a willingness to dial back some regulation of tech to bolster economic growth and encourage development of artificial intelligence. But E.U. officials have shown less openness to changing key regulations related to social media and anticompetitive behavior that are often at the center of American complaints.

President Trump and other administration officials lashed out at the bloc this month after its regulators fined X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, roughly $140 million for violating digital transparency rules. Another investigation underway of X could lead to further fines and penalties.

“Europe has to be very careful,” Mr. Trump said last week.

Authorities in Brussels have in recent weeks also initiated fresh investigations of companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta. That is on top of the billions in penalties that have been issued over the past decade against American tech giants for violating antitrust, digital privacy and tax rules.

The broadside comes at a fraught moment for the trans-Atlantic relationship. While the United States and Europe have historically been closely intertwined allies, the past year has strained that relationship.

Mr. Trump has pulled back from joint defense, insisting that Europeans need to spend more to protect their own nations. His global trade war has rocked automotive, pharmaceutical and other industries across the continent. And many Europeans have been shocked by the administration’s language — starting with a speech delivered by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference in February.

In those remarks, Mr. Vance specifically criticized technology regulation, warning that “free speech, I fear, is in retreat.”

In recent weeks, the White House released a national security plan that lambasted Europe, insisting that the administration wants “Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

That document argued that Europe was declining economically partly because of “national and transnational regulations that undermine creativity and industriousness.”

So far this year, the Trump administration has announced that it has struck 15 trade frameworks and initial agreements. But many of these deals are works in progress that leave major components yet to be worked out.

In fact, European officials celebrated the fact that they had not made major concessions on digital regulation — which they painted as a matter of national sovereignty — when they and the Trump administration struck a rough agreement for 15 percent across-the-board tariffs. But for Washington, digital restrictions remain a sticking point.

With support from the U.S. tech industry, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture against other government’s digital restrictions as well. The United States informed the British government this month that it would pause fulfilling a technology-related agreement between the two countries, which included more collaboration on artificial intelligence and nuclear energy.

American officials felt that Britain wasn’t making sufficient progress in lowering trade barriers as it had promised, people familiar with the discussions said. U.S. officials had been pushing for Britain to loosen its food safety standards, and had expressed frustration with Britain’s online safety rules and digital services taxes levied on American firms.

Matthew Sinclair, the senior director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said it was “unfortunate that lack of progress in broader trade issues resulted in its implementation being suspended.”

""The U.K. should do more to address barriers to trade in digital services, whether that is taxes that single out U.S. multinationals or regulators wielding unprecedented powers without the guardrails that should protect companies against disproportionate or simply misguided attacks on their businesses,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his conservative allies in Britain have long targeted the BBC for what they call its liberal bias. The broadcaster’s critics, and its commercial rivals, have spent years waging a campaign to put ideological pressure on the news organization and to disrupt its public funding.

In his lawsuit, Mr. Trump continued that pressure, saying the BBC “intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers around the world by splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech” on the day that rioters supporting Mr. Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The attacks on the BBC’s integrity and credibility contained in the president’s lawsuit are likely to be a difficult backdrop to the organization’s effort to renew its charter for another 10 years. The charter, which is the constitutional basis for the BBC, sets out its mission, purpose and — crucially — how it is financed.

That process began on Tuesday with the government’s publication of a “green paper” designed to prompt discussion about what changes to the charter might be made. The government will hold hearings and consider changes to how the BBC is operated.

Lisa Nandy, a Labour lawmaker who is Britain’s culture secretary, said in a statement that the BBC “must remain fiercely independent, accountable and be able to command public trust.”

The current BBC charter expires at the end of 2027, and Ms. Nandy pledged that the multiyear review will be a “catalyst that helps the BBC adapt to a rapidly changing media landscape and secures its role at the heart of national life.”

The BBC gets most of its money from a license fee that is charged annually to any British household with a television. It is currently 174.50 British pounds, the equivalent of about $234, and raises about £3.8 billion each year. That is about 65 percent of the BBC’s budget.

The public nature of the BBC’s finances could make it more difficult for the organization to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit with a payment to him, as some news organizations in the United States have done. ABC paid the president $16 million to settle a similar lawsuit.

D.A.T. Green, an English writer and lawyer who runs the Law and Policy Blog, said the president’s case, filed in Federal District Court in Miami, is weak because he offered no evidence of actual harm or that Americans actually watched the BBC program.

“This is not (or should not) be enough to win the case,” he wrote on Tuesday. “But that is not the practical strategy. The strategy is to keep the case from being knocked out until they have forced some sort of settlement.”

Tim Davie, the director-general of the BBC, who announced last month that he would resign amid the crisis over the edits to Mr. Trump’s speech, said in a statement on Tuesday that the organization welcomed the start of what he called a “public consultation” on the future of the BBC.

“We want to secure a public service BBC that is independent, sustainably funded for the long term, and meets our audience’s needs,” he wrote.

The organization has also said it will defend itself against Mr. Trump’s lawsuit. On Tuesday, it repeated that stance in a statement and said it would not comment further on continuing legal proceedings.

The BBC has repeatedly apologized for the editing of Mr. Trump’s speech, but it refused to pay the president monetary damages and has insisted that the broadcaster does not suffer from institutional bias.

“We strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the network wrote in a statement after Mr. Trump’s legal threat last month.

The BBC has argued that the editing of the speech in a documentary shown just before the 2024 election, while an error, was not done with malice, which Mr. Trump would have to prove to win a defamation lawsuit. It has also questioned whether Mr. Trump was harmed by the documentary, given it was only broadcast in Britain, not in the United States, and he was re-elected soon after.

For Mr. Trump, the lawsuit fits into his larger efforts to influence the direction of European politics in the same way that he has seized control of the political and cultural conversation in the United States.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration released its annual national security strategy, which declared that Mr. Trump wants the United States government to be “cultivating resistance” by helping what it called “patriotic” parties across Europe.

In the case of the BBC, those parties have long taken aim at what they say is a biased, liberal news organization. Mr. Trump’s lawsuit not only serves to assert his personal grievance against the BBC, but it also is in line with the interests of the right-wing parties he has pledged to support.

Ms. Wiles made the comments in a series of extraordinarily unguarded interviews over the first year of Mr. Trump’s second term with the author Chris Whipple that are being published on Tuesday by Vanity Fair. Not only did she confirm that Mr. Trump is using criminal prosecution to retaliate against adversaries, she also acknowledged that he was not telling the truth when he accused former President Bill Clinton of visiting the private island of the sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Over the course of 11 interviews, Ms. Wiles offered pungent assessments of the president and his team: Mr. Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality.” Vice President JD Vance has “been a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and his conversion from Trump critic to ally was based not on principle but was “sort of political” because he was running for Senate. Elon Musk is “an avowed ketamine” user and “an odd, odd duck,” whose actions were not always “rational” and left her “aghast.” Russell T. Vought, the budget director, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And Attorney General Pam Bondi “completely whiffed” in handling the Epstein files.

Ms. Wiles described her own reservations about certain policies in real time to Mr. Whipple, author of a well-regarded book on White House chiefs of staff, even as debates raged inside the administration. She said she urged Mr. Trump not to pardon the most violent rioters from Jan. 6, 2021, which he did anyway. She unsuccessfully tried to get him to delay his major tariffs because of a “huge disagreement” among his advisers. And she said the administration needed to “look harder” at deportations to prevent mistakes.

But she did not complain about being overruled and at various points said she “got on board” with the eventual decisions. “There have been a couple of times where I’ve been outvoted,” she said. “And if there’s a tie, he wins.”

The off-script comments felt reminiscent of a similar episode in President Ronald Reagan’s first term when his budget director, David A. Stockman, likewise gave a series of interviews to what was then called The Atlantic Monthly with candid observations that caused a huge stir.

While Mr. Stockman kept his interviews secret from the White House (and nearly got fired), the broader Trump team cooperated with Vanity Fair. Mr. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave interviews and along with top aides like Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt posed for glamour photographs by Christopher Anderson.

Ms. Wiles, a low-key Florida political strategist who ran Mr. Trump’s successful comeback campaign last year, has been the president’s most important aide this term, credited with running a more disciplined operation than he had in his chaotic first term. He has embraced her so much that he referred to her during a rally last week as “Susie Trump.”

But the White House under Ms. Wiles is chaotic too, just in a different way. Unlike John F. Kelly, the president’s longest serving chief of staff in his first term, who saw his job as trying to prevent what he considered radical, unwise or even illegal actions, Ms. Wiles does not view her role as constraining Mr. Trump. Instead, she makes clear that her mission is to facilitate his desires even if she sometimes thinks he is going too far.

She attributes her ability to work for Mr. Trump to growing up with an alcoholic father, the sportscaster Pat Summerall. “High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,” she said. “And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” While Mr. Trump does not drink, she said he has “an alcoholic’s personality” and operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”

In a sign of how much her job revolves around the president’s big-personality, stream-of-consciousness public comments, she keeps a free-standing video monitor next to the fireplace in her West Wing office with a live feed of Mr. Trump’s social media posts.

The president’s fixation on payback against his enemies offers a case study. Ms. Wiles confided in Mr. Whipple in March that she had told Mr. Trump that his presidency was not supposed to be a retribution tour.

“We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over,” she said then. When that did not happen by August, she told Mr. Whipple that “I don’t think he’s on a retribution tour” but said that he was aiming at people who did “bad things” in coming after him. “In some cases, it may look like retribution,” she said. “And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.”

Among the targets, she acknowledged, was Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who won a civil court verdict against Mr. Trump for business fraud with a penalty of nearly $500 million. “Well, that might be the one retribution,” Ms. Wiles said. Did she advise Mr. Trump to back off? “Not on her. She had a half a billion dollars of his money.” (An appeals court later threw out the penalty as excessive but left the verdict intact.)

As for James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump while leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Ms. Wiles said, “I mean, people could think it does look vindictive. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.” She added: “I don’t think he wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it.”

The Trump administration has brought indictments against Ms. James and Mr. Comey, but both were dismissed by a federal judge. The administration has vowed to keep trying, but two grand juries have since refused to re-indict Ms. James and another judge issued a ruling that will make it harder to pursue Mr. Comey.

Reached for comment on Monday evening, Ms. Wiles played down Mr. Trump’s personal motivations in the actions against his enemies. “It’s not that he thinks they wronged him, although they did,” she told The New York Times. “He thinks that they wronged, and they should not be able to do to somebody else what they did to him and the way that you could cure that, at least potentially, is to expose what was done.”

She added that she wanted to get that over with early in the term. “You don’t want it to get in the way of the real agenda,” she said. “And so, loosely, let’s get it all going within 90 days. Which we did. Now, the justice system works slowly and so even if it was initiated in 90 days, it could be a long time before it’s done.”

In the interviews published by Vanity Fair, Ms. Wiles faulted Ms. Bondi, one of her closest friends in the administration, for her early handling of the Epstein files, an issue that has been a cause célèbre for Mr. Trump’s right-wing base.

“I think she completely whiffed on appreciating that that was the very targeted group that cared about this,” Ms. Wiles said. “First, she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn’t on her desk.” Mr. Vance, by contrast, understood the sensitivity because he himself was “a conspiracy theorist,” she said.

Ms. Wiles said she has read the Epstein documents and acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s name is in them. “We know he’s in the file,” she said. “And he’s not in the file doing anything awful.”

But neither, apparently, is Mr. Clinton. Asked about Mr. Trump’s claims going back years that Mr. Clinton had visited the Epstein island, Ms. Wiles said, “There is no evidence.” Asked if there was anything incriminating about Mr. Clinton in the files, as Mr. Trump has suggested, she said, “The president was wrong about that.”

She added that it was Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s idea to go interview Mr. Epstein’s convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, in prison and that the president did not know that she would be transferred to a minimum-security prison camp. “The president was ticked,” she said. “The president was mighty unhappy. I don’t know why they moved her. Neither does the president.”

Ms. Wiles described frustration with Mr. Musk, the billionaire who early in the year was empowered to eviscerate federal agencies and fire employees en masse with almost no process. “He’s an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it’s not helpful, but he is his own person.” When he shared a post saying that Stalin, Mao and Hitler didn’t murder millions, their public sector workers did, Ms. Wiles said, “I think that’s when he’s microdosing.” Asked what she meant, she said, “he’s an avowed ketamine” user.

Mr. Musk has acknowledged trying ketamine “a few years ago,” but denied reports of more recent use. In the interview with The Times on Monday, Ms. Wiles took issue with the quote attributed to her about his drug use. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” But Mr. Whipple played a tape for The Times in which she could be heard saying it.

Mr. Musk’s demolition of the U.S. Agency for International Development including its lifesaving aid to impoverished people around the globe upset Ms. Wiles. “I was initially aghast,” she told Mr. Whipple. “Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to U.S.A.I.D. believed, as I did, that they do very good work.”

Mr. Musk’s approach was “not the way I would do it.” She said she called Mr. Musk on the carpet. “You can’t just lock people out of their offices,” she recalled telling him. She said that Mr. Musk was a disrupter. “But no rational person could think the U.S.A.I.D. process was a good one. Nobody.”

She offered no objection to Mr. Trump’s saber rattling against Venezuela and bombing of boats carrying alleged drug traffickers, suggesting that regime change against President Nicolás Maduro was Mr. Trump’s real goal. “He wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle,” she said. “And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.”

She acknowledged that Mr. Trump, who lately has talked about mounting “land strikes” in Venezuela or elsewhere in the region, would need congressional authorization for that. “If he were to authorize some activity on land, then you’d have to, then it’s war, then Congress,” she said.

Ms. Wiles expressed misgivings about how the roundup of immigrants has been carried out at times. “I will concede that we’ve got to look harder at our process for deportation,” she said. Criminals should be deported, she added. “But if there is a question, I think our process has to lean toward a double-check.” When two mothers were arrested and deported with their children after voluntarily attending routine immigration meetings, she said, “I can’t understand how you make that mistake, but somebody did.”

She acknowledged sharp internal divisions over Mr. Trump’s announcement of major tariffs last spring. “There was a huge disagreement over whether” tariffs were “a good idea,” she said. “We told Donald Trump, ‘Hey, let’s not talk about tariffs today. Let’s wait until we have the team in complete unity and then we’ll do it.’” But he announced them anyway and “it’s been more painful than I expected.”

Ms. Wiles confirmed that she wants Mr. Trump to talk more about the economy and less about Saudi Arabia. She denied that he would use the military to influence the midterm elections and ruled out his running again in 2028. His comments about seeking an unconstitutional third term are “100 percent” about “driving people crazy.”

As for the potential successors, Mr. Vance and Mr. Rubio, she distinguished how each of them came around to supporting Mr. Trump after initially opposing him. “Marco was not the sort of person that would violate his principles,” she said. “He just won’t. And so he had to get there.” As for Mr. Vance, “his conversion came when he was running for the Senate. And I think his conversion was a little bit more, sort of political.”

Mr. Rubio told Mr. Whipple what he has said publicly, that “if JD Vance runs for president, he’s going to be our nominee and I’ll be one of the first people to support him.”

Still, the underlying tension came through when Mr. Vance posed for the magazine’s photographer. “I’ll give you $100 for every person you make look really shitty compared to me,” Mr. Vance joked. “And $1,000 if it’s Marco.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/16/multimedia/16trump-news-promo-4pm-hmzj/16trump-news-promo-4pm-hmzj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:57:47.746116

The Wichita Eagle

WICHITA, Kan. — A 23-year-old man was given the maximum sentence — 20 years in prison — after he “intentionally assaulted and strangled” an on-duty Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer in Wichita, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Kansas.

“Violence against law enforcement is completely unacceptable and will be dealt with very seriously,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Kriegshauser said in the release.

According to court documents Diego Barron-Esquivel, who was described as a Mexican national in the release, “did intentionally and forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate and interfere with” an ICE agent during an altercation on Feb. 28. As a result, the officer was injured, the press release read.

Barron-Esquivel was arrested on March 21 and pleaded guilty in September to forcibly assaulting a federal officer. Court documents show that he asked for leniency.

“ ... I am prepared to accept any punishment permitted by law which the Court sees fit to impose. However, I respectfully request the Court to consider, in mitigation of punishment, that I have voluntarily entered a plea of Guilty,” his guilty plea petition read.

On Dec. 4, a judge sentenced Barron-Esquivel to the maximum penalty: 20 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release.

Court documents suggest that after Barron-Esquivel completes his sentence, he will be “released to the custody of a duly authorized immigration official for removal proceedings in accordance with the immigration laws.”

“And if removed from this country he shall remain outside the United States unless legally authorized to re-enter. Upon which the defendant must report to the nearest probation office within 72 hours after re-entry,” court records read.

According to Barron-Esquivel’s guilty plea petition, he indicated that he understood that conviction of a criminal offense may result in deportation from the United States, “exclusion from admission to the United States, and/or denial of naturalization.”",https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c41994/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+500/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F59%2F409e47bd483bbfc5d195c99498b7%2Fap25027710663013.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 19:57:11.066977

On November 26, 2025, two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot near the White House in Washington D.C. One of the victims, Sarah Beckstrom, tragically passed away the next evening. The suspected shooter was Rahmanulla Lankanwal, an Afghan national who arrived in the United States in September 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the US mission to evacuate and resettle vulnerable Afghans. The event caused a sudden reconsideration of the US evacuation efforts in Afghanistan in 2021.

Lankanwal had previously worked with the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and was granted discretionary parole, on a temporary basis, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, at 8 USC § 1182(d)(5). He resettled in Washington, where he reportedly struggled to assimilate and suffered from mental health concerns. In December of last year, Lankanwal applied for asylum, which he was granted last April.

On November 27, President Trump held up a photograph of the famous C-17 flight, call sign Reach 871, that evacuated over 800 Afghans from Kabul in August 2021. Previously considered an image of heroism (the aircrew received Distinguished Flying Crosses for the flight), Trump framed it representing strategic blunder. Further, the Trump Administration promised rapid and substantial reform to immigration policies, committing to a sort of “reverse migration.” This would include steps such as a permanent pause on migration “from all Third World Countries,” removals, and a “re-examination” of previous admission and asylum decisions. When the Wall Street Journal cautioned against blaming all Afghan refugees for the act of one man, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff openly disagreed.

Much has been made of the vetting process applied to Afghan evacuees. That process is beyond the scope of this post. Vetting is, of course, an important component to evacuation and resettlement. However, in addressing the strategic decision to evacuate Afghans, it is perhaps worth reviewing what happened in the late summer of 2021, and more importantly, why the United States and its allies responded the way they did.

Evacuation from Kabul

Since 2021 nearly 200,000 Afghans have been admitted into the United States. These admissions primarily occurred through three different pathways: (1) Bespoke legislation, (2) refugee admissions, and (3) discretionary parole.

Legislation

The Afghan Allies Protection Act (AAPA), Pub L 111-8, 123 Stat 807, created the special immigrant visa (SIV) for Afghan nationals who provided “faithful and valuable service” to the United States Government in Afghanistan. The AAPA has been amended many times, and for various reasons, the SIV process was notorious for its delays. It was, according to former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, “designed to be a slow process.” Thus, when the Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15, 2021, there were still approximately 70,000 SIV applicants in Afghanistan. These Afghans had worked side-by-side with US Forces and were now at great risk of retaliatory attacks precisely because of that work. US Government officials at the time stated the United States held “a responsibility and an obligation to help the men and women who served by our sides.” But given the AAPA’s statutory process, and the immediate threat to the Afghans, US officials looked to other options.

Refugee Admissions

In August 2021 the Department of State created a Priority 2 Designation for Afghans who could demonstrate a history of serving the United States, but fell short of the SIV qualifications. The designation granted prioritized access and allowed admission outside the established refugee quota. However, Afghans could only apply from a third country. This and other requirements made it less useful as a response to the chaotic evacuation in August 2021. Thus, parole became the primary mechanism for Afghans to be admitted to the United States under emergency circumstances.

Discretionary Parole

Operation Allies Welcome brought 84,000 Afghans to the United States in 2021, most of whom were granted parole, including Lankanwal. This parole is granted for “urgent humanitarian reasons,” as it was similarly used to admit more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees in 1975, and thousands of Iraqi Kurds in 1996, and Kosovar Albanians in 1999. As it reads today, the INA does not define “urgent humanitarian” but instead grants broad discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In application, similar to the experience in Vietnam, the tactical decisions of who qualified for parole were left primarily to US Consular officers and US military members on the ground in Kabul. They were given some direction to identify those who “could be approvable” for the SIV, or who could otherwise “show some nexus” to “American programs and projects” in Afghanistan. Admittedly, grants of parole were rushed, but unlike in Vietnam, the SIV program provided some framework for parole decisions. Ultimately, all three avenues for admission were primarily granted through processes meant to identify Afghans with demonstrated loyalty and service to the United States.

The United States was not alone in this effort. In total, 51 countries contributed to the war in Afghanistan and assisted US led efforts. Nearly all of them similarly accepted Afghan nationals in the days and weeks following the fall of Kabul. Some created bespoke legislation or visa programs, similar to the SIV program, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Denmark, among others. However, most US allies chose to admit Afghan nationals in 2021 under discretionary admission authorities, for humanitarian reasons, similar to US parole. It is primarily through these discretionary admissions that nations like Germany accepted over 13,000, as did the United Kingdom; Belgium received 6,500; Italy received over 8,000; France and Australia each received more than 5,000; and approximately 10,000 went to Canada. This was in 2021 alone; many more followed. For example, Canada received 40,000 Afghans by October 2024.

The United States accepted more Afghan evacuees than any of its allies, just as it had the most servicemembers in Afghanistan. Indeed, the data shows a strong correlation between the number of forces nations deployed to Afghanistan and the number of Afghan refugees they accepted. This correlation exists because, as then Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “we owe a debt of obligation” to those Afghans who served with them.

Policy Justifications for Evacuation and Resettlement

In 2021 US officials similarly argued the United States held an obligation to ensure the safety of Afghans who had demonstrated faithful service to the United States. These arguments did not merely surface in the face of a humiliating retreat but frequently appeared long before full withdrawal was certain. For example, in 2014, then US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard stood in Congress and advocated for a bipartisan effort to expand the SIV program. After emphasizing the importance of teamwork she stated we cannot succeed without acting together with Afghan partners as “members of a team.” She went on to argue that bringing these Afghans to the United States was required to “honor our commitment to our team members.” The sentiment was felt across the globe among US allies and partners, as demonstrated by the synchronized and rapid response in accepting Afghan evacuees for resettlement.

When the dust settled from the chaos of late 2021, many allies conducted formal reviews of evacuation and resettlement efforts. Among many others, the Australian Senate initiated an independent review of its resettlement of more than 5,000 Afghan nationals. The review, completed in March 2023, included a series of lessons learned, and also provided a list of policy justifications for Australia’s actions. Those retrospective justifications are worth reviewing today.

According to the independent review, Australia’s efforts to evacuate and resettle Afghans were justified for four primary reasons.

First, to fulfill a moral obligation. This first, and primary justification is more fully explained below. The Australian review concluded that the moral obligation was felt keenly and almost unanimously by governments that provided forces in Afghanistan. But it was not unlimited. The Australian review notes the obligation must be balanced with competing policy concerns. Security and impartial humanitarian concerns are among those competing policy objectives. These concerns do not displace the moral obligation owed to those who faithfully served and are now at risk of harm because of it. But they do temper the obligation in a way that justifies reasonable limitations and prioritizations.

Second, to create an incentive for employment or partnership with Australia. Here the review makes the obvious point that loyalty is crucial to maintain alliances and attract new partners. The new US National Security Strategy is still committed to cultivating and attracting new alliances. Those efforts are assisted by strategic efforts to protect partners if they become vulnerable through associations to the US and its allies.

Third, to facilitate the settlement of skilled employees in Australia. The review emphasized that Afghans who qualified for the program were generally fluent in English and “job ready” on arrival. In this regard, Afghan evacuees were unlike many others admitted through the traditional refugee admissions process and often made immediate contributions to Australian communities.

Fourth, to provide an important measure of closure for Australians who served in Afghanistan. According to the report, Australian Defence Force personnel felt a “deep and personal” connection to Afghans partners. To abandon these Afghans would aggravate feelings that their efforts had been futile, or worse, had placed their partners at greater risk. The evacuation and resettlement of Afghan partners was, therefore, a form of relief to the memory of servicemembers who served their country in Afghanistan.

Conclusion

Finally, the question of moral obligation deserves further consideration today. Holding a moral responsibility to Afghan partners was the primary, and often the only, policy justification offered by government officials to evacuate and resettle Afghans. There is general consensus that there was no binding obligation in international law to evacuate and resettle Afghan partners. This is true despite nuanced domestic court rulings in the Netherlands and Italy that ordered resettlement of Afghan plaintiffs after they served with those governments. New Zealand’s High Court ruled differently, and in a way that seems more generally accepted, holding that its Government should consider Afghan partners for resettlement under domestic processes, but is not required to admit them under international law.

Similarly, legal obligations do not arise from principles of jus post bellum, the emerging branch of international law that seeks to regulate post-conflict transitions to peace. In the absence of a robust legal framework, jus post bellum principles rely on responsible behavior. They do not create legal obligations to evacuate or resettle. Indeed, jus post bellum has, historically, often focused partially on reparations and accountability following armed conflict, in an embrace of the maxim fiat justitia ruat caelum (do justice even if the heavens fall), as applied by victors. Michael Walzer and others have instead argued for obligations under jus post bellum that focus on the preservation of life. The goal of jus post bellum, he argues, should be “to stop the heavens from falling.” He went on to argue, long before the fall of Kabul, that the minimum expectation of a foreign occupier is that when they leave, they “must make sure that the men and women who cooperated with the occupation in any capacity will be safe in its aftermath—and if any of them are not safe, they must be given the opportunity to leave with the occupying force and be taken to the occupying state.”

This is the lex ferenda obligation the United States holds for Afghans who gave faithful and loyal service to the US mission in Afghanistan. It is not an unlimited obligation. But the evidence suggests that responsible governments take reasonable steps to ensure their allies are not placed at greater risk of harm because of past assistance to that government.",https://i0.wp.com/opiniojuris.org/wp-content/uploads/poppy-field-afghanistan-flower.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683,N,,2025-12-16 22:57:42.005405

What tipped the balance was not agreement with one parent over the other, but how the decision was made.

The European Court of Human Rights said Finland’s courts approached the case with the care required in cross-border child abduction disputes, balancing the competing interests at stake under the Hague Convention rather than defaulting to an automatic return.

Finnish judges, the court said, examined claims that the children faced psychological harm, assessed whether their objections were mature enough to carry legal weight and weighed how a return to Russia would affect their ability to maintain contact with their father.

After weighing all of that, the Strasbourg-based court concluded Finland stayed within the narrow boundaries the Hague Convention sets for blocking a child’s return.

At the center of the dispute was a Russian father who brought his two young sons, then 9 and 11, from Russia to Finland in September 2022 without their mother’s consent.

Once in Finland, he applied for asylum for himself and the children, telling authorities that his opposition to Russia’s political leadership and the war in Ukraine put him at risk if he returned.

Finnish officials later agreed, granting him asylum and extending that protection to his sons.

But while the asylum case was moving forward, the children’s mother took a separate legal route. She asked Finland’s courts to step in under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty meant to undo wrongful cross-border removals by sending children back to where they normally live.

That set up a direct legal clash: When a parent wins asylum, does that protection stop a court from ordering a child’s return under the Hague Convention?

Finland’s Supreme Court answered that question in the negative. On Tuesday, the judges said that approach was compatible with Europe’s human rights standards.

The Hague Convention, the court stressed, is designed to quickly undo unilateral removals by returning children to their home country, unless narrow exceptions apply — including where there is a “grave risk” of physical or psychological harm.

After reviewing the record, the judges said Finland’s courts considered the exceptions and gave detailed, defensible reasons for rejecting them.

The court underlined that the Finnish Supreme Court did not ignore the children’s fears or objections. Judges interviewed the older child directly, with child welfare officers present, and assessed whether his views were mature and independent. They also considered evidence about schooling in Russia, including claims that the children had previously attended classes with military-style elements.

Ultimately, however, the Supreme Court found no sufficient proof that returning the children would expose them to serious harm, an assessment the judges saw no reason to disturb.

Judges stressed that while all three applicants had been granted asylum, the children’s protection flowed automatically from their father’s status — meaning the Finnish Supreme Court was not required to reopen its earlier Hague Convention analysis, having already assessed whether the boys faced a serious risk of harm.

That distinction proved decisive. The court stressed that asylum law and the Hague Convention serve different purposes and that a grant of asylum does not automatically bar a return order under the child abduction treaty.

The judges acknowledged that returning the children to Russia would make it harder for them to maintain contact with their father, who cannot safely travel back. But they said that difficulty alone cannot outweigh the convention’s core logic, which ties a child’s best interests to the “restoration of the status quo” and seeks to prevent a parent from gaining an advantage through a unilateral move.

Taken as a whole, the court concluded that Finland’s judges had done enough, finding that “the reasons given by the Supreme Court to justify the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their family life were relevant and sufficient.”

That approach, legal scholars say, closely tracks the human rights court’s established case law. Paul Beaumont FRSE, professor of private international law at the University of Stirling, said the judges followed a well-settled playbook.

In his view, the chamber “faithfully followed” the court’s landmark X v. Latvia ruling, which requires Hague Convention exceptions to be interpreted narrowly, and was therefore entitled to uphold Finland’s return order even though the children had been granted asylum through their father.

As Beaumont put it, the Supreme Court’s reasoning was “not automatic and stereotyped” but sufficiently detailed to justify the return as “necessary in a democratic society,” including in a case where an older child objected.

Others see the judgment as signaling a narrower path for asylum-based challenges to return orders.

Katarina Trimmings, a professor of law at the University of Aberdeen, said the ruling points to a more cautious stance by the court when children receive asylum automatically through a parent, rather than on the basis of their own individual claims.

In her words, the judgment reflects “a more restrictive approach than some had anticipated,” with the court accepting that the children’s derivative asylum status did not, by itself, require Finnish judges to reopen their earlier risk assessment under the Hague Convention.

She said the decision signals that the human rights court is prepared to give national courts wide discretion when weighing child abduction rules against refugee protection, even where asylum has already been granted.

That procedural emphasis has drawn scrutiny from other legal scholars. Sanna Mustasaari, an associate professor at the University of Eastern Finland, said the judgment closely tracks the court’s recent emphasis on subsidiarity, meaning Strasbourg will step back so long as national courts can show they examined the right questions and followed proper procedure.

But she cautioned that the ruling gave too little weight to the children’s asylum status, largely because it was granted automatically. In her words, “the court could have and should have deliberated more on the issue of asylum status of the children.”

In her view, that gap matters, since asylum law and child abduction law rest on different legal foundations and serve distinct protective purposes.

Similar concerns surfaced inside the court itself. In a joint concurring opinion, Judge Saadet Yüksel and Judge Hugh Mercer agreed with the outcome but flagged what they saw as a blind spot in how asylum was handled.

They took issue with the way Finland’s Supreme Court leaned on the fact that the children’s asylum status was granted automatically, without pausing to reconsider what that status might signal about the risks the children could face if sent back. As they saw it, asylum is not a technical label but a recognition that return itself carries danger, something that should not be brushed aside simply because protection flows from a parent.

As the judges put it, “it is inherent in the notion of asylum that there is a grave risk for those granted asylum if they are returned to their country of origin.”

Yüksel and Mercer did not say the return order should necessarily have been blocked in this case. But they warned that future courts should tread carefully. Treating asylum as a procedural detail rather than a warning sign, they cautioned, risks weakening protection against forced return in cases involving refugees, especially when children are involved.

The applicants’ lawyer echoed that concern, warning that the judgment places heavy weight on procedure at the expense of substantive refugee protection.

Harri Nevala, the lawyer representing the applicants, said the ruling reflects “a shift toward an emphatically procedural model of human rights supervision,” one that risks treating asylum as marginal in child abduction cases and raising the evidentiary bar for families who have already been granted international protection.

For now, the children will remain in Finland under interim measures, and the return order cannot be enforced unless the ruling becomes final or the court lifts its protective order.

Beyond the immediate outcome, the case underscores a growing strain across Europe, as judges are increasingly asked to untangle family disputes shaped by war, political repression and cross-border flight. Even so, the court signaled that the Hague Convention’s return system remains intact unless specific and concrete risks to a child can be shown.

Russia today is marked by a sharply constricted political and social space. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has expanded the use of “foreign agent” and “extremism” laws, tightened controls on independent media and civil society groups, and criminalized public criticism of the war.

Many opposition figures, journalists and rights organizations have been forced into exile or shut down, while courts have played a central role in enforcing the state’s crackdown. That broader environment forms the backdrop to the case, even if the human rights court’s legal analysis was confined to the narrow framework of the Hague Convention.

The judgment will become final in three months unless one of the parties asks for a review by the court’s Grand Chamber.

Finland’s Foreign Ministry said it was reviewing the judgment and declined to comment further at this stage.

“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted.","The BBC is preparing to argue Donald Trump’s $10bn court case against it should be dismissed, arguing it has no case to answer over the US president’s claims he was defamed by an episode of Panorama.

The development comes after Trump filed a 33-page complaint to a Florida court on Monday, accusing the broadcaster of “a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory and malicious depiction” of the president in the documentary.

On Tuesday, the BBC said it would defend itself over the suit. It is understood that the corporation is likely to argue that it did not have the rights to air the documentary in the US, and that the case should therefore be dismissed.

The move is an attempt to see the lawsuit off before litigation costs mount. It will be greeted with relief by supporters of the BBC who have argued that its editorial independence would be called into question if it sought to settle.

The Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast before the 2024 US presidential election. It spliced together two parts of the January 6 speech he gave before the attack on the US Capitol that day.

Trump’s complaint argues both that the programme defamed him and that it violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It says the broadcast caused Trump “massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects”.

The BBC will note that audiences in the US were unable to access the show via iPlayer, the BBC’s streaming platform.

The corporation is also arguing that Trump could not have suffered serious reputational harm from the programme because he won the presidential election. In Florida, Trump actually increased his vote share from his previous campaigns.

The lawsuit alleges that Florida residents may have been able to watch the programme using a virtual private network (VPN) or via the international streaming service, BritBox. The BBC has not responded directly to those claims.

The BBC board and lawyers are still working closely on the issue. The BBC’s legal department is guiding the discussions, but the board, together with the BBC chair, Samir Shah, are understood to be closely involved.

The suit also claims the documentary was distributed in the US through a company called Blue Ant Media Corporation. The company is not a defendant in the case.

However, a spokesperson for Blue Ant Media said none of its buyers had aired the Panorama episode in the US, while the version it was distributing did not include the infamous edit, which had been cut out to make the programme shorter.

The timing could scarcely be worse for the BBC, as it searches for a new director general. It comes after the resignation of current director general Tim Davie and head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, following the fallout from the Panorama edit.

It also comes with the government officially launching the process of renewing the BBC’s charter, which will see it fundamentally re-examine whether the corporation should be part-funded by advertising or subscriptions.

The spliced clips in the edition of Panorama suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”

The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.

Shah has already personally apologised to Trump and the BBC has said it gave “the mistaken impression” that the president had “made a direct call for violent action”. However, its lawyers have argued it did not defame him.

While there were no complaints about the documentary at the time it was broadcast, the edit came to light in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC. His memo was sent to the BBC board earlier this year and subsequently leaked to the Daily Telegraph.

At one point, Trump’s lawsuit cites former prime minister Liz Truss in support of its allegation that the BBC is “institutionally biased against President Trump”.

“No less an authority than the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, Liz Truss, discussed this bias, the need to hold the BBC accountable, and the BBC’s pattern of actual malice,” it states.

Keir Starmer has come under pressure to back up the BBC. Both the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddleston, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, urged the prime minister to use his relationship with Trump to persuade him not to pursue the legal action.

Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said it was “right that the BBC stand firm” against Trump’s claims of defamation and that he hoped “they will continue to do so”.

Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally who founded the Newsmax platform, said it would prove cheaper for the BBC to settle the case.

However, figures close to the BBC have urged it to fight the legal action. Former BBC Radio controller Mark Damazer said it would be “extremely damaging” to the BBC’s reputation to offer a settlement.

Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy, said he believed the claim was “meritless”, but that Trump was seeking political, rather than financial, gain.

“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted. “There are lots of legal defects in the complaint.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5de5a2274a01defdc6e2f027aea5477fcc8cba3/3639_1105_4892_3913/master/4892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=132c93ad46ca6fbaa3b2eabf9df3d0b9",N,,2025-12-16 16:57:56.311884
