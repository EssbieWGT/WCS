The Trump administration has rescinded guidelines that previously limited immigration enforcement actions at what were considered sensitive areas, including schools.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested a parent outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista Wednesday morning as families dropped off students for the school day, according to the school district.

The arrest happened just weeks into the new school year on a “public roadway” near Enrique S. Camarena Elementary school in east Chula Vista, Giovanna Castro, a spokesperson for Chula Vista Elementary School District, told inewsource.

Immigration officials have been accelerating arrests in recent weeks under President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda. Earlier this year, his administration rolled back a policy that once limited ICE activity at schools and other sensitive locations.

Multiple district officials said this was the first they’ve heard of ICE activity around Chula Vista schools.

The district’s superintendent, Eduardo Reyes, sent an email to parents notifying them of the arrest and the district’s policy for handling interactions with law enforcement.

“We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces,” Reyes said in the letter.

ICE officials did not immediately respond to questions from inewsource about the person who was arrested and whether officers had a warrant.

By Wednesday afternoon, news of the arrest had reached some parents who came to pick up their children from school. Most who talked to inewsource said they were surprised to hear of the arrest. Some expressed more concern about the incident.

One grandparent who did not want to be named said he felt “sorry” for the family of the person arrested.

“You come to drop off your kids at school and it could be the last day,” he said.

Another parent of two Camarena students who was pushing a stroller into school that afternoon said she was scared by the news. She said she is a U.S. citizen, but she’s worried about immigration officials stopping her because she is Mexican.

Zach Rhoads, who came to pick up his son that afternoon, read the email from the superintendent aloud to his wife earlier in the day. He said he was encouraged by the district’s response and that the arrest didn’t happen inside the school campus.

Rhoads isn’t worried about immigration enforcement affecting his family, but said “we definitely feel for the people that do have to go through that.”

ICE officials in San Diego have been increasing arrests recently, mostly of people who have no criminal records, only immigration violations.

Wednesday’s arrest wasn’t the first ICE incident near a school in San Diego County recently.

In June, two parents returning home after dropping off their child at Laurel Elementary in Oceanside were pulled over by ICE officials in SUVs. The father was handcuffed and arrested, Voice of San Diego reported.

Immigration advocates have criticized Trump’s rollback of the sensitive locations policy, saying it will lead parents fearful of immigration enforcement to keep their kids home from school.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta released guidance earlier this year for schools to prepare for potential immigration enforcement on campuses. School districts across the country have released their own policies for handling interactions and requests from immigration officials and pledged to keep their schools safe for students.

“The Chula Vista Elementary School District is committed to supporting every student, regardless of immigration status, and our highest priorities are our students’ safety, education, and well-being,” Castro wrote in an email to inewsource.",https://inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_8798-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 07:57:15.374554

Reassigning employees from FEMA who likely have no experience with immigration enforcement appears to be yet another attempt to bolster the ICE head count.","A number of employees with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) were informed via email late on Tuesday that they have been reassigned, effective immediately, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The workers had seven days to accept the reassignment, under threat of being removed from the civil service.

According to sources familiar with the matter, those reassigned were probationary employees with less than one year at FEMA, who because of presumed weaker civil service protections were fired early in the Trump administration but reinstated after a court order. Like at many federal agencies, these employees had been on paid administrative leave for months, among the over 100,000 men and women across the federal government who have been collecting a salary yet doing no work.

But now, these probationary FEMA employees on leave are apparently being shifted as a stopgap maneuver to bolster the ranks of ICE, which received tens of billions of dollars in the GOP mega-bill but faces the daunting task of hiring thousands of new agents to an unpopular agency with plummeting morale.

The Prospect reviewed an email from Sara Birchenough, an acting division director in staffing at the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The email, with the subject line “Management Directed Reassignment Effective August 5, 2025,” notified recipients that they would be reassigned to ICE “due to the mission requirements of the Department.” The Department refers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); both FEMA and ICE are under its umbrella.

It’s unclear how many employees were reassigned from FEMA in this manner and exactly how they would serve. Employees were told that the position description would be explained to them separately. They were given seven calendar days from receipt of the letter to accept or decline the appointment; a non-response would be considered acceptance. “If you choose to decline this reassignment, or accept but fail to report for duty, you may be subject to removal from Federal service as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 7513,” the email reads, referring to a portion of the U.S. Code.

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson told the Prospect, “Under President Trump’s leadership and through the One Big Beautiful Bill, DHS is adopting an all-hands-on-deck strategy to recruit 10,000 new ICE agents. To support this effort, select FEMA employees will temporarily be detailed to ICE for 90 days to assist with hiring and vetting. Their deployment will NOT disrupt FEMA’s critical operations. FEMA remains fully prepared for Hurricane Season. Patriotic Americans are encouraged to apply at join.ice.gov.”

Under federal rules, executive branch agencies do have the authority to involuntarily reassign employees within departments, as long as the employee gets notice and has the ability to reject the reassignment. Removal is allowable as a disciplinary measure for rejecting a reassignment.

AFGE Local 4060, the union local for FEMA employees, could not be reached for comment.

Reassigning dormant employees to ICE in particular signals how difficult it has been to add employees to an agency tasked with controversial abductions throughout the country.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act more than tripled ICE’s budget, allowing for the hiring of up to 10,000 new agents. But experts immediately questioned how successful this effort would be. In Trump’s first term, a proposed hiring surge failed to come close to reaching its goals. There’s less margin for error this time, with White House officials making brutal demands to round up, detain, and deport millions of people living in the country.

Since the law’s passage, ICE has advertised hiring terms that look increasingly desperate. It has offered signing bonuses as high as $50,000 as part of a program to lure back recent retirees. It has dangled student loan forgiveness and generous repayment plans for new recruits, while tightening student loan options for everyone else. It briefly offered cash bonuses to agents for rapid deportations before canceling the proposal.

Reassigning employees from FEMA who likely have no experience with immigration enforcement appears to be yet another attempt to bolster the ICE head count. If their task is to assist with hiring and vetting, as DHS says, it suggests a deficit of human resources professionals to vet new ICE agents. But the workers coming from FEMA are not necessarily trained in human resources, particularly in vetting agents who go out into the field for immigration operations.

A rushed process to boost staffing levels by any means necessary is likely to lead to relaxed hiring standards and improper practices. Already, American citizens have been detained and deported, numerous human rights violations have been alleged, and several detainees have died in custody.

The number of migrants being placed in removal proceeds has been increasing over the last five years, but will like see larger numbers in fiscal year 2025.

Immigration courts across the United States have been in a crisis for over a decade, research shows. This comes as the number of cases reaches nearly 4 million.

The number of immigrants appearing for their immigration court hearings in El Paso is declining, courthouse observers said.

Sister Leticia Gutiérrez, the director of the Diocese of El Paso's immigrant hospitality ministry, has been visiting the immigration court in the Richard C. White Federal Building as an observer since late May. She began just after masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began arresting immigrants upon leaving the courtroom, but in the last month she said that the number of migrants appearing is declining.

""The first day we arrived, the room was full of people for their court hearing, but since then, the presence of immigrants has been declining,"" Gutiérrez said. ""I don't know if it is because people are no longer following their process out of fear, because it is always difficult to proceed. But the truth is that every day ICE agents come.""

The migrants are either choosing to appear digitally or are not appearing at all out of fear of being detained for expedited removal after the judge dismisses their case.

She documented only three of 28 immigrants with appointments on July 30 who arrived for their morning hearings. The day prior, four of the sixteen immigrants appeared, with two appearing online and only two appearing physically.

The El Paso Times also observed a near-empty waiting room in the immigration court. Of 30 individual cases, only seven appeared for their afternoon hearing on June 25.

This trend has been increasing as news spreads about ICE officers arresting immigrants following their hearings as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up arrest numbers and deportations.

In some cases, federal lawyers ask immigration judges to dismiss migrants' cases, and then ICE agents apprehend migrants as they leave courtrooms and transport them for deportation.

At least 83% majority of immigrants historically appeared for their hearings, according to research. These numbers increase to 93% if they have a lawyer representing them.

But the current uptick is likely attributed to the high-profile arrests, but also to a lack of communication from the court, Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said.

""Arrests are deterring people,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""But also I think the lack of information and the overwhelmed DHS and immigration courts are also contributing (to people not showing up).""

Increasing 'in abstentia' removal orders

The number of ""in absentia"" removal orders — which are deportation orders issued if a migrant fails to appear for their hearing — has been increasing since 2022, with 62,791 orders being issued that fiscal year. Two years later, the number increased to 222,921 orders in fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 31, 2024, according to data from the U.S. Department of Justice.

'In absentia' orders have increased in fiscal year 2025, with 133,223 removal orders issued between October 2024 and March 2025. The number of orders in the third quarter of 2025 will likely be higher, Bush-Joseph said.

""Even under Biden, we were issuing record numbers,"" Bush-Joseph said, ""and they are on track to issue even more this fiscal year.""

The majority of the immigrants arriving at the El Paso immigration court lack legal counsel.

A crisis in immigration courts

The U.S. immigration court has faced a crisis over the last decade, seeing massive backlogs of cases, limited legal counsel for migrants and insufficient staffing. The Migration Policy Institute found in a 2023 report that the crisis has grown worse during the first Trump administration.

There were 1,979,313 pending immigration cases as of April 2023, according to the Department of Justice. Two years later, there were 3,923,439 pending immigration cases.

""The crisis at the immigration courts means that the system doesn't work well for anyone,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""It doesn't work for the judges who are under a lot of pressure to be quickly deciding these really complex cases, and it doesn't work for immigrants who are trying to navigate this extremely complex system.""

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" does little to ease the pressure on the courts, Bush-Joseph points out. The new law, which was approved by congressional Republicans in July, provides billions for the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement and deportations, but it caps the number of immigration judges at 800 and does not provide any more funding for the courts.

The Trump administration has removed judges as the administration seeks to carry out its expedited deportation policy. It is estimated that the courts would require 1,300 judges for at least 10 years to process the current backlog.

Lawsuits against ICE courthouse arrests

As immigrants have slowly stopped appearing for their hearings, courthouse arrests by ICE officers have continued. Ten immigrants were arrested during the afternoon hearings on July 31, Gutiérrez said.

But immigrant rights groups are seeking to block this rapid removal of immigrants following their hearings.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, UndocuBlack Network and CASA filed a lawsuit against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on June 11. The lawsuit was included in a previous complaint that looks to stop the stripping the parole that was granted to Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

The San Antonio-based RAICES, the National Immigrant Justice Center and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area filed another lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for courthouse arrests on July 16. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a dozen individuals who were detained across the country after they were arrested by ICE officers after their hearings were dismissed.

The arrests have generated fears for immigrants with hearings, as courthouse observers have noticed. It has driven them underground in attempts to avoid arrest and expedited removal.

""They are becoming more and more invisible,"" Gutiérrez said. ""They are remaining in an irregular siutation, which comes with a lot of disadvantages. It is a very big concern when it comes to families with children.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/05/PTX1/84053512007-i-ce-in-el-paso-1779.JPG?crop=3499,1968,x0,y182&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-07 04:57:00.806618

The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.
U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs.
This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.
Nevertheless, to gain asylum in an immigration court or with an asylum officer, victims of gendered violence will now have to prove a more specific reason for their suffering.","A new decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) will make it harder for people fleeing gender-based violence to gain asylum in the United States.

On July 18, the BIA published its decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, finding that people persecuted solely on account of their sex are unlikely to qualify for asylum because sex alone does not meet the definition of a particular social group (PSG), one of the five categories protected from persecution under U.S. asylum law. The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.

The case involved the asylum application of Ms. S.G., a woman who fled El Salvador for the United States after she was stalked and threatened by gang members in her community. Like many women who flee gender-based violence, she feared returning to El Salvador because of the persecution she suffered, and because her government would not protect her.

U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs. When these guidelines were created in 1951, member states had just emerged from the horrors of the Holocaust. It is no surprise that they focused on protecting people persecuted for their race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.

However, the United Nations’ guidelines also included a broad term, PSG, to describe people persecuted on account of an identity that did not fit into, but was similar to, the listed categories. After all, societies classify people in different ways over time, so no list could account for all the ways humans target each other for persecution.

Which groups of people meet the PSG definition — and which don’t — has been the subject of debate ever since, particularly when it comes to victims of domestic violence.

To gain asylum in the United States, a noncitizen like Ms. S.G. must show she is part of a listed protected category — race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a PSG — or that other people around her think she belongs to one of these protected groups. The immigration court or asylum officer then assesses whether the harm the noncitizen suffered, or fears, is “on account of” her protected group membership, and assesses a number of other factors.

If an asylum applicant claims membership in a PSG, she must prove that her PSG meets three criteria. Since 2014, the BIA has defined a PSG as a group of people who share a common characteristic they cannot, or should not, have to change (an immutable trait). The group must have defined boundaries (particularity), and others in the same society must view the group as set apart from the rest of the population (social distinction). This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.

In Matter of K-E-S-G-, the BIA decided that sex fails this three-part test. Even though it found that sex is an immutable trait, the BIA ruled that the PSGs comprised of “women” or “Salvadoran women” lack particularity because these groups are too diverse and have no unifying characteristic that unites their experiences. In particular, the BIA argued that women “encompass[] a diverse cross section of society of widely varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.”

But this justificationis troubling since racial, religious, national, and political groups also contain diverse cross-sections of society. Furthermore, the idea that women encompass a diverse cross section of society may be true in some cultures, but certainly does not apply where cultural norms punish women for straying outside expected behavior and block women from accessing specific parts of society, such as positions of religious, economic, and political authority. Nevertheless, K-E-S-G- states that “[g]roups defined solely by the characteristics of sex and nationality contain no narrowing features” — regardless of context.

The BIA also reasoned that if it were to decide that sex is a PSG in Ms. S.G.’s case, it would improperly create a new protected ground in asylum law, contrary to the intent of Congress. However, the BIA itself previously noted that an asylum applicant who seeks protection based on membership in a PSG must prove the existence of her PSG using information about her own social context. Before K-E-S-G-, for example, the BIA found that whether or not “married women in Guatemala unable to leave their relationship” was a PSG depended on “the facts and evidence in each individual case” because “any claim regarding the existence of a particular social group in a country must be evaluated in the context of the evidence presented regarding the particular circumstances in the country in question.”

The BIA also justified its ruling by stating that the U.N. didn’t think about sex when it created its refugee guidelines. But the PSG category often is used to capture categories of persecuted people the U.N. failed to anticipate. The K-E-S-G- decision approvingly cites other PSGs the U.N. drafters certainly did not consider, such as the gay community and victims of female genital cutting.

Importantly, as the BIA acknowledged in its K-E-S-G- decision, some circuit courts have previously expressed skepticism about prior BIA decisions finding that PSGs defined by sex and nationality are too broad and thus lack particularity. Under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright, courts need not defer to the BIA’s interpretations of the asylum statute. Advocates whose clients are denied asylum based on K-E-S-G- and ordered removed can therefore argue in petitions for review that the agency reading of the statute warrants no deference, and instead argue for an interpretation of “particular social group” that accords with the plain text, statutory context, legislative history and purpose, and any prior helpful circuit case law.

Nevertheless, to gain asylum in an immigration court or with an asylum officer, victims of gendered violence will now have to prove a more specific reason for their suffering. For example, a Salvadoran woman fleeing an abusive partner will no longer be granted asylum at this level based on her status as a Salvadoran woman, despite El Salvador’s status as the country with the world’s highest rate of intentional female homicides. But if she can show she’s being targeted as a single mother, and that single mothers are a distinct group in Salvadoran society, her asylum claim still has a chance. As a result, people fleeing gender-based violence are placed in a precarious position where they have to explain why they were targeted for persecution in more detail than their neighbor’s fleeing on account of other protected grounds.

The BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G- gives asylum seekers persecuted on account of their gender an uphill climb, and their advocates now have a great deal of work cut out for them in an environment where more is demanded of them.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-kesg-gender-violence-asylum.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:08.646948

The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.
This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs.","In a key win for immigrant rights organizations, a California Court of Appeal ruled that the University of California has not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its “discriminatory policy” barring the hiring of undocumented students from on-campus jobs.

A UCLA alumnus and a lecturer filed a lawsuit in October arguing that the UC system’s hiring policy violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.

Plaintiffs said that, without access to campus jobs, many undocumented students struggle to meet tuition costs and cover basic needs such as housing and food. These students are often forced into the underground economy and miss out on career-advancing opportunities such as research assistant positions.

Attorneys representing the UC system argued that its policy is justified because hiring undocumented students could run afoul of a federal law that bans the hiring of people without legal status and may provoke retaliation from the federal government.

A three-judge panel, however, ruled that the system’s policy violates California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act and that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds to uphold it.

“The University does not assert that it relied on the requirements of a federal statute or regulation in deciding to not to amend its policy — only on the risks associated with adopting a policy that the federal government might consider unlawful,” states the ruling. “Accordingly, we conclude that the University abused its discretion by relying on an improper justification for continued application of its facially discriminatory policy.”

The panel stopped short of ruling that UC must overturn its policy; rather, it ordered that the university system reconsider the policy based on proper legal criteria.

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs consider the ruling a victory and are calling on UC to open jobs to undocumented students.

“The court’s powerful opinion rejects the UC’s attempt to justify its policy discriminating against undocumented students. It is wrong — both morally and legally — to bar our state’s most talented students from access to crucial educational employment opportunities based on their immigration status,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, in a statement. “We call on the UC to comply with state law and treat all its students equally, regardless of immigration status.”

The UC system said it is reviewing the court’s ruling but has not commented on whether it will change its hiring policy.

“To the extent it’s compliant with the law, the University continues to believe undocumented students deserve the same opportunities as our other students,” said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook in a statement.

University officials have previously expressed fear that changing the system’s hiring policy could result in civil fines, criminal penalties and the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal funding. Last week, the Trump administration announced it was freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding to UCLA, citing concerns over antisemitism and the university’s handling of pro-Palestinian protests.

Tuesday’s court ruling comes after a years-long push to open campus jobs to students lacking documentation.

The debate over whether it is legal to do so revolves around the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which bars the hiring of people without legal status.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that this federal law does not apply to government employers such as the UC system. Attorneys representing UC did not argue that the IRCA applies to public universities but said that the federal government might believe it does.

In Tuesday’s ruling, the three-judge panel noted that UC had the option to file a lawsuit against the federal government to secure a court ruling on whether the university system is subject to the IRCA.

Under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — better known as DACA — undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children could get work permits. The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.

President Trump, however, terminated the DACA program in 2017, and although courts have challenged that decision, the program is no longer accepting new applicants.

There are now around 64,300 undocumented college students who are not eligible for DACA in California and, therefore, not eligible for work authorization — or campus jobs.

“As someone who was undocumented and a UC lecturer, I know firsthand the transformative power of on-campus work opportunities,” said plaintiff Iliana G. Perez in a statement on the court ruling. “UC must now act with urgency to dismantle exclusionary policies and ensure all students, regardless of immigration status, can fully participate in their education, contribute to their campuses, and shape California’s future.”

Students and faculty began advocating for the UC system to open jobs to all students regardless of their immigration status in 2022.

The UC regents established a working group to consider change its hiring policy in 2023, but the group suspended its work due to fear that doing so would violate the IRCA.

A year later, the California Legislature passed the Opportunity for All Act, requiring state public universities to open up employment to all students, but Newsom vetoed the bill, citing legal concerns over the IRCA.

This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs. A court initially denied this request, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court, which then ordered the state Court of Appeal to rule on the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal heard oral arguments in May and issued its ruling Tuesday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46fe4b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6224x3268+0+441/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2Fe4%2F76102e404d92a4cf28be9d5e89ab%2F1297686-me-uc-board-of-regents-daca-students-jlc-0517-10947.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:16.161804

GEO Group also expects to profit from increased electronic monitoring of immigrants.","On GEO Group’s second quarterly earnings call, the private prison company’s executive chairman, George Zoley, told participants that the company was pursuing “unprecedented growth opportunities” as President Donald Trump rapidly expands the U.S.’s detention and deportation apparatus.

As with their previous earnings call, GEO Group had much to celebrate. Notably, Zoley has donated thousands of dollars to Republican candidates and PACs, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has defended Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda at every turn, is a former GEO Group lobbyist.

“Congrats on the quarter and all the positive news” and the “fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” one participant told executives during the question and answer session.

For the second quarter of 2025, GEO Group reported total revenues of $636.2 million compared with $607.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, although the company’s expenses increased by approximately 7 percent. The company’s net debt totals approximately $1.7 billion, compared with $1.68 billion in debt at the end of the first quarter of 2025.

“We have increased our budget to approximately $100 million in physical plant and technology improvements to better position GEO in responding to ICE’s expanding needs,” said GEO Group CFO Mark J. Suchinski.

The Trump administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda has meant lucrative contracts for GEO Group. The company is under contract for approximately 20,000 beds at 21 facilities, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company’s history,” Zoley said. The company’s contracts represent “more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide.”

In 2024 alone, Zoley contributed more than $150,000 dollars to Republican candidates and causes, including Trump, the Republican National Committee, and Republican PACs, according to Truthout’s analysis of Open Secrets data.

Since January, GEO Group has entered into government contracts for an 1,800-bed immigration jail in Baldwin, Michigan, and a 1,000-bed immigration jail in Newark, New Jersey, which are expected to bring in more than $85 million and $60 million in annual revenues, respectively. In June, the company announced that it was reopening a lock-up in Georgia that can hold more than 1,800 people and, when operating at full occupancy, is expected to generate approximately $66 million in annual revenue. GEO Group also announced that month that it had entered into a five-year contract with the U.S. Marshals Service to provide transportation services across 14 states. The contract is expected to bring in approximately $29 million in annual revenue.

Zoley said that the Trump administration’s plan to detain people on military bases is another potential source of revenue for the company, and that they’re identifying “existing ICE facilities where we can add approximately 5,000 combined beds using temporary and permanent facilities.”

“All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long standing support services provider for ICE with a 40 year long track record,” he said.

GEO Group also expects to profit from increased electronic monitoring of immigrants.

“We’ve stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices, and are well-positioned to scale up the use of GPS tracking for non detained illegal aliens once the ICE detention capacity has been maximized,” Zoley said.

In July, GEO Group gave raises to Zoley and the company’s CEO. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company wrote that it had approved increasing the target bonus and target stock award from 100 percent to 150 percent of their base salary, in part because of the “unprecedented business opportunities that the Company is experiencing.” The chair’s base salary is $1.1 million, while the CEO’s is $1 million.

That good fortune comes at the expense of the thousands of people locked up in GEO Group’s immigration jails. The company has been repeatedly accused of detaining people in inhumane conditions. People imprisoned at Delaney Hall, the lock-up in Newark, New Jersey, have reported that they’re denied food, access to clean water, medication and visits with their family.

But on the call, there was no mention of human rights abuses or families torn apart. With good reason, executives were optimistic about the company’s future. “On a personal note, I would like to thank the GEO board for extending my employment contract to April 2029, allowing me to participate in guiding our company through the remainder of this presidential administration,” Zoley said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-6-Delaney-Hall.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:29.722925

José Pineda's attorneys have filed a complaint letter with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement recounting his ordeal. The letter is a required precursor to filing a lawsuit.

Pineda's attorneys say there's no clear explanation as to why he was pulled over and held, despite having on his person paperwork showing his right to be in the U.S.

"" It seems like the only reason why they actually did this is because of their racial animus and because he looked like a Latino man,"" Pineda's attorney, Victoria Miranda, said.

Pineda, 61, was born in El Salvador and has spent the last 30 years in the U.S. He is here under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, according to Lawyers for Civil Rights, who are representing him. That humanitarian status gives Pineda and other TPS holders the right to live and work in the U.S.

Despite that, on May 27 while Pineda was driving in Weymouth to a landscaping job in a company vehicle, he was stopped by ICE, according to the complaint letter. Five armed officers surrounded the vehicle. Pineda explained he was legally authorized to be in the U.S. and presented his driver's license to an officer.

""The same officer then disrespectfully and incorrectly insulted Mr. Pineda in both English and Spanish, saying that if someone was not born in the United States, they do not have any rights,"" the complaint states.

Pineda was arrested, cuffed and taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, a site that other detainees have called ""abysmal"" and ""inhumane."" WBUR has reported that the Burlington office, which was designed to hold people for just a few hours, has been used to hold some people for days or for more than a week.

Pineda was held in Burlington for 36 hours before he was released. During that time, he said he was kept in an overcrowded room with 40 to 60 people and only a small sink and one toilet. According to the complaint, Pineda had to stand for most of his time there and there was no room to lie down to sleep.

""This is someone who has been complying for 30 years and simply got pulled over, arrested, chained, cuffed, brought to a facility with inhumane conditions for no reason at all,"" his attorney, Miranda, said.

ICE officers confiscated Pineda's license, social security card, employment authorization card and credit card. The also seized $600 in cash, which was not returned, according to the complaint letter.

ICE declined to comment on Pineda's complaint.

In June, Lawyers for Civil Rights filed a similar complaint letter to DHS and ICE for a Chelsea family. Federal agents smashed he window of the family's vehicle and pulled Daniel Flores-Martinez out of the car in front of his wife and children on the way to church.

Miranda said Pineda had to ""succumb"" in the moment to ICE agents, despite his legal status. But she hopes other immigrants worried about similar stops will know their rights and be able to state them to authorities.

Perhaps, she said, ""immigration enforcement will get the message that this type of practice is not okay.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0716_burlingtonice-3-1-1000x530.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:34.176465

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin.
In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree.
She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.
Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.","Safe countries of origin are those whose citizens do not have to fear state persecution, according to assessments by the German government or the European Union. Whether such assessments are accurate is a matter for debate that often ends up in court.

Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that EU countries are allowed to designate safe countries of origin to fast-track asylum procedures if authorities disclose the sources for their assessment. The court also found that for a country to be designated as safe, it must offer adequate protection to the entire population, including minorities.

The Luxembourg-based court also said that while having a fast-track procedure does not violate EU law, the designation of safe countries must be subject to judicial scrutiny so migrants can challenge decisions made on their asylum claims.

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin. Asylum seekers from these countries hardly stand a chance of being granted asylum in Germany. Currently, eight European non-EU and two African countries are on this list.

Safe country candidates: Algeria, India, Morocco, Tunisia

The new German coalition government of center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) had agreed to add more countries to the list. ""We are continuously assessing whether more countries meet the requirements. In particular, a country will be classified as safe if fewer than 5% of asylum seekers from that country have been accepted over at least a five-year period.""

It remains to be seen whether these plans will be as easy to implement as it sounds in the coalition agreement following the ECJ ruling. A spokesperson for the interior ministry, which is responsible for asylum policy, said that the ruling will be reviewed.

Yet the German government still intends to reform the process for determining whether a country of origin is safe. In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree. This would mean that neither the Bundestag nor the Bundesrat (the upper house of parliament representing the 16 federal states) would have a say in the matter.

Interior Minister calls for reform to asylum law

The coalition has already submitted a draft bill on this issue, which is to be voted on after the parliament's summer recess. The first debate already took place last July. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt took that opportunity to criticize what he sees as an insufficient number of deportations of rejected asylum seekers: ""Our goal now is to remove the obstacles to effectively limiting illegal migration,"" he said.

One such obstacle that the CSU politician highlighted was the fact that, under current law, people who have been ordered to leave the country are entitled to legal representation before their planned deportation can be enforced. This is one of the regulations that is to be abolished. Dobrindt hopes that this will also speed up deportations to countries already listed as safe.

Within the European Union, there are already discussions about setting up joint centers for the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers. The interior ministers of EU member states discussed this at their meeting in Copenhagen last July.

This is an idea that Dobrindt is in favor of. He pointed out that it can be difficult for individual member states to reach deals with non-EU countries, while it could be more expedient when several EU countries work together. Several countries already have concrete plans in place. ""I wouldn't rule this out for Germany either,"" said the German interior minister.

'Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place'

In Dobrindt's view, many of the people who came to Germany in the past were not eligible for asylum. He hopes that the planned reform will send a clear message: ""People who come from a safe country of origin should not make the journey. Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place.""

Some members of the political opposition in Germany hope that the European Court of Justice's ruling will force the federal government to change its course on asylum policy.

""The ECJ ruling on safe countries of origin is a major success for human rights and the individual right to asylum in Europe,"" said Green Party MP Filiz Polat. She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.

The Left Party: Georgia and Moldova are not safe third countries

Clara Bünger of the Left Party has also called on the governing coalition to carry out a comprehensive review of the list of safe countries of origin.""Georgia and Moldova should be removed from this list immediately.

The reason given was the precarious human rights situation in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Also, the EU member state Czechia considers only parts of Moldova as safe, while the Transnistria region is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and therefore considered unsafe.

The ECJ ruling, according to Bünger, ""also represents a clear repudiation of the federal government's plans to classify other countries, such as Tunisia and Algeria, as safe.""

Same-sex sexual relations are punishable by law in both Tunisia and Algeria. Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.

The lawsuit, filed at a federal court in California, represents the latest legal challenge to two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that have been key to the State and Homeland Security Departments’ so-called ideological deportation policy. In several other cases brought around the country, judges have also been asked to weigh the constitutionality of the INA provisions and the administration’s policy around them.

The California case was brought by the organization that publishes The Stanford Daily and two noncitizen former college students who fear their pro-Palestinian views or advocacy could put them at risk of being deported. Attorneys for the newspaper said in the lawsuit that international students on staff are turning down assignments related to the war in Gaza or “seeking removal of their previous articles about it.”

“Since the Trump administration began targeting lawfully present noncitizens for deportation based on protected speech in March 2025, lawfully present noncitizen students working at and contributing to Stanford Daily have self-censored expression for fear of visa revocation, arrest, detention, and deportation,” attorneys from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which brought the new case, wrote in court papers.

One of the INA provisions at issue gives Secretary of State Marco Rubio the authority to decide that a noncitizen is removable if he “personally determines” that the individual’s views “would compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” The other gives the secretary the power to “at any time, in his discretion” revoke a visa.

The Stanford Daily and the two unnamed former students are asking a federal judge to bar the administration from using the pair of provisions to deport them and any noncitizen members of the newspaper’s staff based on their “protected speech.”

“The First Amendment cements America’s promise that the government may not subject a speaker to disfavored treatment because those in power do not like his or her message. And when a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights, the Constitution prevails,” the attorneys wrote.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of a weekslong bench trial in a separate case in Boston during which members of the Trump administration testified under oath about the government’s targeting of noncitizen pro-Palestinian students and scholars.

The trial, which concluded on July 21, highlighted how DHS began taking orders from the State Department as it went after certain professors and students to change their immigration status and work to have them deported. US District Judge William Young, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, is now deciding whether the government’s “ideological deportation policy” had the effect of unlawfully chilling the speech of certain professors.

Hundreds of migrants departed from Chiapas state in southeastern Mexico on Wednesday with the intention of reaching the nation’s capital, Mexico City, to settle there.

As foreigners and asylum seekers continue to be turned away under US border and immigration policies, many migrants now see Mexico as a destination rather than just a transit country.

Local reports estimate the caravan at around 300 people, primarily from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The group departed from Tapachula -- a city on Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala that has become a key point in hemispheric migration.

Unlike previous caravans, the newly formed group aims to reach Mexico City rather than the northern border as US President Donald Trump continues his crusade against immigrants.

Speaking to Anadolu, Gabriela Hernandez, the director of Casa Tochan -- a migrant shelter in Mexico City – explained the reason for the shift in destination for many asylum seekers.

“Because Trump has been decisive. Not only did he remove the CBP One app, but he also toughened the entire process of migrating legally.

“Obviously, those coming in that caravan can't return to their countries, which is why they see Mexico as an option. Besides, we already know -- even if it’s kept under wraps -- that Mexico has been accepting deportees from the United States who aren’t even Mexican. So Mexico ends up with both those being returned and those trying to arrive,"" she said.

Beyond the dismantling of legal pathways such as CBP One -- the US Customs and Border Protection app launched during President Joe Biden’s administration to help migrants schedule asylum appointments -- the Trump administration has also resumed deporting non-Mexican migrants to Mexican territory.

“The Mexican government continues with its approach of ignoring migrants. In no speech or political discourse does it address foreign migration, as if it didn’t exist. This makes it clear that it won’t take them into account, which is the most serious issue for people who have no other option but to stay in Mexico,” Hernandez added.

Echoing the US government’s tough approach, Mexico has increasingly moved to restrict migration. In an effort to placate Trump’s threats of imposing tariffs, President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration has deployed large numbers of military troops to control both borders. Raids on migrant camps at key entry points such as Tapachula and Mexico City have also intensified.

The caravan itself has been targeted by these policies. Mexican authorities recently arrested Luis Garcia Villagran, a well-known human rights defender of immigrants and organizer of the caravan.

Villagran, who has been vocal in criticizing the Mexican government’s anti-immigrant stance, was detained by local police on Aug. 5 in Tapachula after announcing the caravan's formation.

Human rights groups and migrant advocacy organizations have condemned his arrest as part of a persistent pattern of criminalization against those who defend migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico.

“Civil society organizations, collectives and human rights defenders express our concern over a pattern of criminalization against those who defend and support migrants, as part of the growing crackdown on immigration worldwide,” said a joint statement by several civil organizations in response to Villagran’s arrest.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/08/07/thumbs_b_c_ae6e9f1e5fd6d7299f8e5bdc92077c2f.jpg?v=080609,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:57.531553

The White House has enlisted the help of local law enforcement through cooperation agreements, and states such as Florida and Texas have volunteered to help, but any concerted effort will require hiring thousands more agents by an agency that has struggled with retention and retirements in recent years.

The administration also said that some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be detailed to ICE for 90 days to help hire and screen new applicants.

In addition to lifting the age restrictions, DHS is also offering a signing bonus of up to $50,000, student loan repayment assistance and other benefits to attract recruits, the agency said in a news release.

“ICE encourages Americans with a commitment to public safety, national service, and upholding the rule of law to apply today to jumpstart a fulfilling career in federal law enforcement,” it said.

ICE, which has about 20,000 personnel, has until required recruits to be at least 21. Candidates to be criminal investigators, with limited exceptions, could not be older than 37 and deportation officers could not be over 40.

The department said in a news release that it would waive age limits for new applicants so “even more patriots will qualify to join ICE,” the agency responsible for finding, arresting, detaining and removing people who are in the U.S. illegally.

The agency is at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Earlier this summer Congress passed a spending bill that gives ICE money to hire 10,000 more staff.

Currently, ICE applicants must be 21 years old and no older than 37 or 40, depending on what position they are applying for.

In an interview with Fox & Friends, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said applicants could be as young as 18.

“We no longer have a cap on how old you can be or you can continue at age 18, sign up for ICE and join us and be a part of it. We’ll get you trained and ready to be equipped to go out on the streets and help protect families,” Noem said.

The department said all recruits would have to go through medical and drug screening and complete a physical fitness test.

The agency promoted the age-limit changes on social media with enthusiastic tones, casting the immigration-enforcement efforts as not only patriotic but also epic and even cinematic.

One post was accompanied by an image that looked like a recruiting poster showing images of a young man and an older man, both wearing military style tactical gear and holding weapons with the words “NO AGE CAP JOIN ICE NOW” emblazoned on the bottom. “We’re taking father/son bonding to a whole new level,” it said.

Another showed an advertisement for a Ford Club Wagon — a large van once popular for how many people it could carry — with the words: “Think about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy?”

Written at the bottom of the image was the words “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” Absolute boys is a slang term used to praise someone.

ICE earlier announced a recruiting campaign aimed at finding and hiring the deportation officers, investigators and lawyers it will need to meet its hiring goals.

As part of that campaign the agency is offering an eye-catching bonus of up to $50,000 for new recruits as well as other benefits like student loan forgiveness and abundant overtime for deportation officers.

Until the laws are followed, environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams should issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction.
It makes no difference that the detention center holding hundreds of detainees was built by the state of Florida since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the suit said.
“The construction of a detention center is an action that is necessarily subject to federal control and responsibility,” they said in a recent court filing.
Ron DeSantis ′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida.","MIAMI — A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday over whether to stop construction of an immigration detention center built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” because it didn’t follow environmental laws.

Until the laws are followed, environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams should issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.

The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.

A second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 18.

The detention facility has ignored a review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act, and the lawsuit was meant to assert the public’s rights to make sure environmental harm does not occur, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified in court Wednesday. Samples noted that her organization was founded in 1969 by environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas in response to a failed effort to build a massive airport in the same location.

An attorney for the state of Florida questioned Samples during cross examination about whether Friends of the Everglades had filed any lawsuits or taken legal action against the airport or its owner, Miami-Dade County, over the past decade. She acknowledged they had not.

“Victories are sometimes imperfect,” she said.

When the attorney asked Samples if she agreed with the political decision to detain and deport immigrants, the judge shut down the question, saying the trial would be limited to environmental issues.

Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center’s construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.

It makes no difference that the detention center holding hundreds of detainees was built by the state of Florida since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the suit said.

“The construction of a detention center is an action that is necessarily subject to federal control and responsibility,” they said in a recent court filing. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.”

Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Judge Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Williams had yet to rule on that argument.

The lawsuits were being heard as Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.”

“The court’s preliminary settlement approval represents a crucial step towards compensating class members and recognizing their harm,” said MALDEF attorney Luis Lozada.
According to the lawsuit, NuVision denied Bautista Martinez a $35,000 auto loan after giving initial approval to his application because he is not a permanent resident of the United States.
As a DACA recipient, Bautista Martinez is authorized to work in the U.S. and possesses a Social Security number.
“This preliminary approval is a meaningful step toward justice, not just for me but for many others facing the same barriers,” said Bautista Martinez.","LOS ANGELES – A federal judge has granted preliminary approval of a class-action settlement between NuVision Credit Union and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and other immigrants who were denied loans and financial services based on their immigration status rather than their ability to repay.

MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) filed the lawsuit on behalf of Luis Saul Bautista Martinez, 29, of Los Angeles, a DACA recipient, and other immigrants who comprise the settlement class.

“Demonization of immigrants in the rhetoric of irresponsible national leaders does not justify unlawful discrimination in any area of the economy,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “The resolution of this case approved today should help to lead others engaged in discriminatory practices to cease that activity.”

As part of the agreement, preliminarily approved today, NuVision has agreed to create a settlement fund of $108,800 to compensate the class of immigrants affected by the challenged practice. NuVision has also ended the use of the challenged practice. The settlement is one of more than a dozen MALDEF has reached with financial institutions that deny services to DACA recipients and other immigrants because of their immigration status rather than their creditworthiness.

The settlement provides for $3,200 payments for each of the 34 class members. All class members are residents of California. NuVision must also pay attorneys’ fees and other costs.

“The court’s preliminary settlement approval represents a crucial step towards compensating class members and recognizing their harm,” said MALDEF attorney Luis Lozada. “Importantly, financial institutions are starting to promptly change their policies and practices, as well as resolve any lingering problems with us.”

In April 2023, Bautista Martinez applied for an auto loan from NuVision, based in Huntington Beach, California. According to the lawsuit, NuVision denied Bautista Martinez a $35,000 auto loan after giving initial approval to his application because he is not a permanent resident of the United States. As a DACA recipient, Bautista Martinez is authorized to work in the U.S. and possesses a Social Security number.

“This preliminary approval is a meaningful step toward justice, not just for me but for many others facing the same barriers,” said Bautista Martinez. “It reinforces that what happened was wrong and that financial institutions must be held accountable when they discriminate. I spoke up because I knew it wasn’t just about me, and I hope this shows others that no one should accept being denied what they’ve earned.”

The suit challenged NuVision’s denial of a loan to Bautista Martinez as a violation of Section 1981 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, immigration status, age, and other characteristics.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Western Division.

NuVision is a federally insured, member-owned credit union serving 160,000 members in Alaska, Arizona, California, Washington, and Wyoming with $3.3 billion in assets.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States.
Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.
That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.
For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.","Evgeny and Evgeniia faced an excruciating choice.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told the couple they could leave the United States with their child and return to their native Russia, which they had fled seeking political asylum. Or they could remain in immigration detention in the United States — but their 8-year-old son, Maksim, would be taken away and sent to a shelter for unaccompanied children.

In the end, they chose the agony of limbo in the United States over a return to a place where they saw no prospect for freedom or any future for their family.

“Interior separation is approved,” ICE officials concluded in writing after the couple insisted they could not return to Russia. The last time Evgeny and Evgeniia saw Maksim was on May 15, in a room at Kennedy International Airport in New York City, as ICE agents led them back to detention in New Jersey.

“A few days, right?” Maksim begged his parents that day. “A few days?”

The couple, who asked to be identified only by their first names out of fear for their family back in Russia, said they tried to keep their son calm. Maksim pleaded with his father, who told the boy what he wanted to hear. “I said, ‘Yes, yes, it will be just a few days,’” Evgeny said, recounting the moment in an interview.

Their case is an example of a little-known tactic the Trump administration is using to pressure undocumented immigrants to leave the United States. Officials have begun separating children from their families in small numbers across the country, in what appears to be a more targeted version of one of the most explosive policies of President Trump’s first term.

The New York Times has uncovered at least nine cases in which parents have been separated from their children after they refused to comply with deportation orders, according to internal government documents, case files and interviews.

The practice is not as widespread as the “zero tolerance” policy of Mr. Trump’s first term, when thousands of children were systematically taken from their parents as they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and sent to shelters and foster homes.

But the new cases suggest that the administration has decided to use family separation as a tool, at least in some instances, to persuade families to leave and to create a powerful deterrent for those who might come to the United States illegally.

“The parents had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully choose to not comply,” she said.

She denied that there was any new policy on family separations.

Previous administrations separated undocumented families for reasons including national security concerns, public safety and child endangerment. But Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, said that previous administrations, to her knowledge, did not use the threat of family separation as leverage to get people to leave the country.

“I’m not aware of ICE previously using family separation as a consequence for failure to comply” with deportation orders, Ms. Trickler-McNulty said.

Instead, she said, past administrations typically would have released such families into the United States with ankle monitors to track them as they awaited court dates, a practice that has contributed to enormous backlogs in the immigration system.

The notion of choice touches on a key difference between the separations from the first Trump administration and now.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States. Adults were criminally charged with illegally entering the country and imprisoned, while their children — some of them babies, just months old — were taken away.

The family separation policy was enormously divisive. Wrenching images of children being pried from the arms of their parents stirred global outrage, but administration officials argued privately that was the whole point — the policy was meant to deter people from making a dangerous and illegal journey.

Mr. Trump ultimately relented to pressure and ended the policy in 2018. The Biden administration later agreed to a settlement that blocked family separations at the border, with some exceptions, including if children were in danger.

Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.

The Trump administration insists that it is simply enforcing the law. Mr. Trump has made aggressive enforcement a key part of his deportation campaign and says the American people elected him in part to get tough on immigration.

“To be clear, refusing a judge’s deportation order is a crime,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “If law enforcement pulled an American citizen over with kids in the back seat and they chose to not comply with lawful orders, the parents would be arrested, and the children would be placed in safe custody.”

Still, deporting families has always been a struggle for presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic alike. Children, for the most part, cannot by law remain in federal custody for more than three weeks. That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.

At that point, the deportation challenge only grows. ICE agents would have the difficult task of arresting people with established ties to communities, who had been working or going to school and building lives in the United States.

During the Biden administration, officials considered various ideas, including arresting one parent or fining families who refused to comply with deportation orders, although they never put those policies in place, a former U.S. official said.

Evgeniia, speaking through an interpreter from ICE detention, said her family traveled to the Mexican border in hopes of getting an appointment under a Biden-era program that allowed people to enter the United States at a port of entry after registering with a government app. Mr. Trump canceled that program on Jan. 20, so she and her husband decided that driving to a port of entry and asking for asylum was the only way to reach safety.

They were immediately put into detention.

The American Civil Liberties Union is investigating the legality of the separations, said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the group.

“That the Trump administration has found a new form of family separation is hardly surprising given they have yet to acknowledge the horrific harm caused by the original policy and are now blatantly breaching provisions of the settlement designed to provide relief to those abused families, many of whom to this day still remain separated,” he said.

The court settlement banning separations specifically referred to the practice at the southern border. Now, however, the separations are not happening at the border — they are happening inside the country, so there may be legal wiggle room.

In at least one of the cases, ICE officials wrote that the separation fell outside the scope of the settlement, saying there were no “implication/requirements” when it comes to the court case.

Ms. McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said immigrants were taking advantage of the system and in some cases creating a public disturbance.

“We have seen recently illegal alien families have started to use a tactic where they refuse to board a commercial flight, often lashing out and posing a threat to the safety of their own children,” she said. As a result, Ms. McLaughlin added, the authorities “must ensure the children are safe and not in harm’s way until the family can soon be removed from the country.”

Regarding the case of Evgeny and Evgeniia specifically, Ms. McLaughlin said the couple “were acting so disruptive and aggressive they endangered the child’s well-being.”

The couple denied those allegations, and there was no mention of such a disturbance in the internal case file describing the separation, which was obtained by The Times. The file says that “since there is no other option to enforce the removal order in a safe manner as a family unit, interior separation is approved.”

A separate document, a referral of Maksim’s case to the agency that oversees custody of unaccompanied migrant children, said, “Subject was separated from his family on 5/15/2025 due to his parent’s refusal to board an aircraft for removal from the United States in violation of US law.”

Evgeny said he was trying to save his son from a longer separation in Russia because of what he believed to be a sure prison sentence there.

“I was explaining to them, to the officers, that our lives are in danger and our livelihood would be in danger,” he said. “And at some point, I kind of lost my bearings and started to cry.”

“I was explaining that I could not be deported, because I will face grave danger in Russia,” he said.

The couple had crossed the border with another Russian family, Pavel Snegir and his 11-year-old son, Aleksandr. They, too, were hoping for political asylum in the United States after Mr. Snegir’s wife was locked up in Russia for her political views, he said.

But after several weeks in border custody together, Mr. Snegir and his son were transferred to ICE custody in May and taken to an airport in San Diego. There, he was told he could take Aleksandr to New York City for a court hearing.

But once they got to the airport, Mr. Snegir refused to board the plane, having become convinced that he would be deported to Russia once he got to New York. Later that day, after the flight had left, an ICE official told him he would be separated from his son because he refused to be deported.

“I’m not giving my son away,” Mr. Snegir said, moving to shield Aleksandr.

The ICE official, Mr. Snegir recalled, told him that he would be taken to the ground, handcuffed and taken away if he did not relent.

“I did not move. I did not agree to do what she was asking, and everything she promised happened,” he said of the ICE official.

Aleksandr, who had witnessed his mother being arrested in Russia, appeared to be in shock, Mr. Snegir recalled: “He was asking why.”

After several weeks of separation, Mr. Snegir was visited by an ICE official who offered him another option: Go with your son, or we will deport you by yourself and you might not see him again.

This time, Mr. Snegir agreed to go back to Russia with his son.

But in a twist, the next day it emerged that Mr. Snegir had passed a protection screening for his claim of fearing torture in Russia. That means he can still be deported — just not to Russia.

For now, ICE is trying to deport him to a third country, but none have agreed to take him yet, according to internal agency documents. Until then, the two are being held separately, the father in ICE detention and the son in a shelter for unaccompanied children.

As it turns out, Evgeny and Evgeniia also passed their protection screening, which means the United States has determined that they, too, cannot be deported to Russia.

But as they wait for the next step, they remain in ICE detention. And Maksim is now in a foster home.

“It’s terrible, that’s what I can say,” Evgeniia said. “I wouldn’t wish it even to an enemy. It’s a constant grief and longing.”

She is allowed to speak on the telephone to her son, but she has no real answers to the first question he asks her: “Mama, when are you going to take me out of here?”

But for some parents, the danger is too great.

An Indian couple who were separated from their three children after they refused to board a commercial flight decided, in the end, to go back to India without the children, according to internal ICE records and their lawyer.

The couple asked not to be identified, but their case records showed that the first attempt to deport the family as a group had failed. The family unit, or FAMU, “refused to board the removal flight (commercial).”

The record went on to state that the family’s failure to comply with deportation orders was “a clear violation of law and hindrance to execute the removal order.”

“This is an interior enforcement separation,” it continued.

After several weeks, the couple were deported to India. In response to a request for comment, an ICE official said the agency was working to send the children back, too.

For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.

But inside her ICE detention facility, Evgeniia tries to think of a hopeful future.

“I’m imagining how I will hug him when we meet again,” she said of Maksim. “I even saved a couple of candies, because that’s what I was planning to give to him when I see him again. That’s what I imagine.”

Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week.
“My colleagues and I have been trying to get information regarding their operations and decision-making process before, during or after ICE raids occur,” said Rivas.
In addition, the lack of transparency is leading to confusion and misinformation about the use of ‘bounty hunters’ to conduct these raids,” Rivas continued.
The Push for Legislation Lawsuits against the Trump administration have made some progress in protecting immigrants and citizens alike from being targeted and racially profiled by federal agents.
Being the minority party in Congress, Rivas acknowledged that passing these laws can be more difficult than when she was a State Assemblywoman working with a supermajority in the state legislature.","When Rep. Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week. She knew, however, that the move from the California State Legislature to Washington – with an unpredictable president and Republican congressional majority – would test her prowess as an elected official.

Just over six months into her first year as a congresswoman, Rivas has already faced a direct attack on her community, with the increase of federal immigration raids that began in June targeting her district and other Latino communities across the Southland.

“I feel like it’s been six years,” Rivas said.

“It is challenging to be a new member of Congress during this time,” she continued. “But that’s our job – to protect and defend our communities.”

Rivas said she is “all in” on defending the San Fernando Valley community and becomes more motivated every time she is back at home in her district.

On Monday, Rivas visited the City of San Fernando City Council to speak directly with councilmembers and constituents about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and what her office is doing to combat President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy.

“It’s important for elected officials on all levels of government to stand together against the threat that ICE poses to our communities,” Rivas told the San Fernando Valley Sun/el Sol in an exclusive interview.

She noted that her office is partnering with local organizations, distributing “Know Your Rights” information, connecting constituents to legal aid and can help locate missing loved ones by calling federal facilities on behalf of residents who reach out to them for help.

Although witnesses have documented masked federal agents indiscriminately kidnapping people off the street and disregarding the rule of law, Rivas believes it’s still important for our communities to be informed of the rights available to them.

“If you don’t know that your rights have been violated, how do you know whether you can complain or file a lawsuit?” Rivas pointed out. “Someone should know if their rights were not respected. Like me – I knew that [my rights were violated] when they didn’t let me into the detention center.”

The day after federal immigration officials’ first show of mass force in LA, conducting multiple raids across the county, Rivas joined three fellow members of Congress in downtown LA at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building to exercise their right as elected officials to conduct an oversight visit of the federal detention center. The congressmen were checking on the conditions of detainees after reports surfaced of immigrants being held with limited legal access and restricted access to food, water and medicine.

They were illegally denied entry for a tour and blocked by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE personnel.

“My colleagues and I have been trying to get information regarding their operations and decision-making process before, during or after ICE raids occur,” said Rivas. “We will continue asking these questions and demanding answers.”

Rivas has also visited the Adelanto Detention Facility and has since joined colleagues in writing letters to DHS and ICE to demand accountability.

Rivas Calls for an In-Person Meeting with Immigration Authorities

Most recently, Aug. 4, Rivas drafted a letter to Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, and Rodney S. Scott, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), requesting an in-person meeting to “conduct direct and constructive oversight to ensure accountability and transparency into the recent raids that have taken place in Los Angeles.”

“ICE has used intimidation tactics that have sown fear and chaos in communities,” wrote Rivas. “This sharp uptick in arrests and detainments by agents who are masked and in unmarked vehicles has not only instilled fear in communities, it has also not met the stated goal of this administration to target the ‘worst of the worst.’”

According to ICE detention data as of July 27, approximately 71% of those detained have no criminal conviction, and many of those convicted have committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

In the letter, Rivas questions how and who is conducting the often violent operations, since agents refuse to identify themselves with visible labels or identification.

“Without the ability to properly identify agents involved, there is no way to adequately file detailed complaints or requests for investigation. In addition, the lack of transparency is leading to confusion and misinformation about the use of ‘bounty hunters’ to conduct these raids,” Rivas continued.

The congresswoman highlighted multiple incidents in the district, including inappropriate use of force by CBP agents during a raid in Pacoima, and individuals complying with government orders at the Van Nuys Courthouse having their cases dismissed and being turned over to ICE.

“As an elected official not just representing the hard-working immigrant communities of the San Fernando Valley, but as someone who grew up here, I seek transparency and accountability from all federal agencies,” she concluded.

The Push for Legislation

Lawsuits against the Trump administration have made some progress in protecting immigrants and citizens alike from being targeted and racially profiled by federal agents. Last Friday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the federal government’s appeal, upholding an LA district judge’s ruling granting temporary restraining orders (TRO) that prevent the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and require the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

“It’s a good step forward. I think it gave constituents or residents of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County hope that this could end,” said Rivas about the ruling. “But we need to keep our foot on the gas pedal.”

The Trump administration is expected to eventually appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the majority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents. If the case is overruled, the onus would once again fall on Congress to create protective legislation.

Rivas noted that she has signed off on seven bills aimed at curbing ICE’s power and holding the administration accountable. These include the No Secret Police Act, which would require ICE, DHS and CBP agents to display proper identification and would ban the use of face coverings; the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which would prevent federal agents from showing up at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals and churches; and the Born in the USA Act, which would prohibit any funds from being used to implement Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship.

The congresswoman has also cosponsored a bill, the American Dream and Promise Act, that aims to build pathways to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients.

It’s been almost 40 years – with both Democrat and Republican led legislatures – since the last comprehensive piece of legislation for immigration reform was passed.

Being the minority party in Congress, Rivas acknowledged that passing these laws can be more difficult than when she was a State Assemblywoman working with a supermajority in the state legislature.

“The mission stays the same. The issues and priorities I have are the same as I had as a state legislator,” she reassured. “It’s just going to take longer to achieve them and work towards them in Congress.”

Rivas said she is learning from and collaborating with her colleagues, and is determined to keep fighting for the Latino communities in the San Fernando Valley.

“It’s obvious that these agents are our racial profiling in our communities, and that’s one of the biggest reasons that I’m involved – because it’s directly affecting the 29th district,” said Rivas.

Constituents who are legal permanent residents and even U.S. citizens born in this country have expressed concern to the congresswoman – afraid that if they are not carrying proof of their legal status or a birth certificate, they too will be unjustly detained simply because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

“We can’t let Trump define who an American is,” Rivas said.",https://i0.wp.com/sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_04567_Page_2-e1754535598593.jpg?fit=1613%2C1095&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-07 02:56:47.176926

The Justice Department has been suing states to end tuition breaks for students without legal residency, starting with Texas in June. It has also filed lawsuits in Kentucky, Minnesota and, most recently, Oklahoma. Last year, Florida ended its tuition break for students living there illegally,

“Federal law prohibits aliens not lawfully present in the United States from getting in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens,” the Justice Department argued in a lawsuit this month in Oklahoma. “There are no exceptions.”

The tuition breaks once enjoyed wide bipartisan support but have increasingly come under criticism from Republicans in recent years.

Here's what to know about the tuition breaks:

Texas' tuition policy was initially passed with sweeping bipartisan majorities in the Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, as a way to open access to higher education for students without legal residency already living in the state. Supporters then and now say it boosted the state’s economy by creating a better-educated and better-prepared workforce.

The law allowed students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they had lived in Texas for three years before graduating from high school and for a year before enrolling in college. They also had to sign an affidavit promising to apply for legal resident status as soon as possible.

Texas now has about 57,000 qualifying students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. The state has about 690,000 students overall at its public universities.

The difference in tuition rates is substantial.

For example, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a 34,000-student campus along the border with Mexico, a state resident will pay about $10,000 in basic tuition for a minimum full-time class schedule in the upcoming school year. A nonresident student will pay $19,000.

Texas' law stood mostly unchallenged for years, but it came under fire as debates over illegal immigration intensified. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, Perry apologized after saying critics of the law “did not have a heart.”

The law withstood several repeal efforts in the Republican-dominated Legislature. During the legislative session that ended June 2, a repeal bill did not even get a vote.

But the ax fell quickly. After the Trump administration filed a lawsuit calling the law unconstitutional, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a key Trump ally, chose not to defend the law in court and instead filed a motion agreeing that it should not be enforced.

In Oklahoma, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, also a Republican, filed a similar motion.

“Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful,"" Drummond said in a statement.

At least 21 states and the University of Michigan system have laws or policies allowing tuition breaks for the immigrant students, according to the National Immigration Law Center, which favors them. Those states include Democratic-leaning ones such as California and New York, but also GOP-leaning ones such as Kansas and Nebraska.

According to the center, at least 16 states allow the immigrant students to receive scholarships or other aid to go to college.

Immigration lawyers and education advocates said they are assessing whether there are legal avenues to challenge the rulings.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/21211054-237a-42e5-97db-d363bd1bab60/wirestory_354d0a413e0e99fa6712d288e6fd381c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:37.663410

Obama calls GOP redistricting plans in Texas a 'power grab'

Former President Barack Obama criticized the GOP's congressional redistricting plans in Texas on social media this evening, saying the proposed revisions would undercut democracy.

""We can’t lose focus on what matters — right now, Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year’s midterm elections."" Obama wrote on X. ""This is a power grab that undermines our democracy.""

Texas Democrats left the state to delay votes on the plans, which would almost certainly give the GOP five more House seats in Congress. Their departure has outraged Republicans, with Gov. Greg Abbott suing to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office.

Rhode Island lawmakers grilled about Gaza during town hall

and

Rep. Seth Magaziner and Sen. Jack Reed — two Democratic lawmakers from Rhode Island — have been interrupted numerous times at a joint town hall in Johnston by people asking about Israel's war in Gaza.

Several people have asked them to take tougher stances against Israel and to call the loss of life in Gaza a “genocide” and for them to stop taking money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Reed called the conflict “complicated,” which elicited an audible laugh from an audience member who yelled in response that it wasn’t.

Magaziner called the scenes in Gaza “horrific,” adding later that neither he nor Reed had “anything kind to say about” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Sen. Michael Bennet tells town hall he’s 'incredibly angry' at Democratic Party for losing 2024 election to Trump

and

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a supportive crowd at a town hall today that he is “incredibly angry” at his party for losing last year's presidential election to Trump.

“We should never have lost this election,"" Bennet said at the event in Durango, part of the congressional district represented by GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd.

Bennet, who is running for governor, said that the election loss has been ""catastrophic"" and that the party was unprepared last year when it came to its policy platform.

""You tell me what the Democrats’ education policy was in the last election. You tell me what the Democrats’ health care policy was. You tell me if Democrats had an immigration policy that made any sense,"" Bennet said.

Bennet added that he is ""not here to blame them for that, but that’s part of what we have to figure out, as well.""

Responding to a question about Medicaid cuts by the Trump administration, Bennet said he would fight “to the death” for protections, adding that Democrats should message on the consequences of cuts to health care programs.

“People need to know what these Medicaid cuts are doing to our community. They have to know the unfairness of the tax bill that Donald Trump just pushed through, the cult of personality that he has in the U.S. Senate and other places. And we have to carry that message forward,” he said.

An attendee said Colorado “needs” Bennet in the Senate and shared her concerns about finding “someone equally competent” to replace him should he become governor.

“This decision was, for me, a matter of conscience. This was a moral decision,” Bennet said.

“This is not about quitting. It’s not about being worn out. It’s not about giving up. It’s not about even not wanting to spend one more day in the Senate with Ted Cruz, even though I don’t honestly want to do that,” he continued as the audience laughed. “It’s about being in the fight that you want to be in and making sure we can win that together.”

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has reached out to Trump about pardon, source says

Sean “Diddy” Combs’ defense team has reached out to Trump seeking a pardon after his conviction on prostitution-related offenses, a source close to the legal team told NBC News today.

In an interview with Newsmax on Friday, Trump said “they have talked to me about Sean” when he was asked about pardons, but Trump did not announce any decision.

The source close to Combs’ legal team confirmed that it has been in contact with Trump.

Combs, a musician and hip-hop mogul, was convicted in July of two counts of interstate prostitution and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced in October.

Texas governor sues to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus chair

Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition today with the Texas Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office after Wu and other Democrats left the state to delay efforts by Republicans to redraw congressional district lines.

The lawsuit argues that Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus chair, violated the state Constitution and that his absence amounted to his abandonment of office.

Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment this evening.

Abbott said in a statement that Wu and more than 50 other Democrats who left the state had failed to meet quorum requirements in refusing to return.

""Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,” Abbott said. “Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.”

Abbott had warned in a statement Sunday that he would seek Democrats' removal if they weren't present when the House convened the next day.

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin urges fellow Democrats to ‘go nuclear’ in redistricting fight

and

Reporting from Benton Harbor, Mich.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a rising Democratic star from Michigan, told NBC News that Democrats should “go nuclear” to counter Republicans’ push in Texas and other red states to redraw congressional maps in their favor.

Slotkin, a first-term senator who was chosen to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s joint address to Congress this year, said Democrats have to fight fire with fire.

“I’m going to urge and encourage blue states like a California or Chicago or Illinois to do the same thing. I don’t want to do that. I want the country to have a completely nonpartisan drawing of the lines based on the census. But if they’re going to do that and go nuclear, so am I,” she said in an interview after her first and only town hall of the August congressional recess last night.

Trump says FBI 'may have to' get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who left state

Trump said federal authorities ""may have to"" get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who absconded from the state to block Republicans from moving forward with mid-decade redistricting plans.

Asked by a reporter today whether the federal government and the FBI should get involved in locating and arresting the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, Trump said, ""Well, they may have to, they may have to.""

“A lot of people have demanded they come back. You can’t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That’s what elections are all about,"" he added.

Yesterday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s Department of Public Safety to arrest Texas Democrats who left the state after the Texas House voted to compel the sergeant-at-arms to “send for” the return of the lawmakers “under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”

Government agencies get access to AI from Anthropic, Google and OpenAI

The General Services Administration announced a partnership today with three artificial intelligence companies — Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — that will allow federal agencies to use AI tools across the federal government.

“Thanks to the amazing work of the Federal Acquisition Services team, these transformative AI projects are available for agencies to procure immediately,” Federal Acquisition Services Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said.

The uses of AI technology will vary. The AI tools can support a wide variety of applications, from back-office automation to critical mission functions, such as real-time translation, cybersecurity support and large-scale data analysis, a GSA spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said GSA adopted the technology first, claiming that the use of AI has saved more than 365,000 staff hours this year. The hope is that when it spread among the federal government — and when the workforce becomes more proficient and the AI technology improves — the time savings will allow more efficiency and innovation across the government.

On concerns about Americans’ data, the GSA spokesperson insisted the government is taking a cautious, security-first approach to AI that will ensure sensitive information remains protected but did not provide specifics.

GSA’s hope, according to the spokesperson, is that it will immediately translate to agencies, giving them access to tools that can improve workflow and citizen services — and for the AI companies, going through GSA gives them an entry point for offering services and products to the federal government.

Massachusetts governor hosts fleeing Texas Democrats but rules out mid-decade redistricting in her state

Reporting from Boston

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey this afternoon hosted nine Texas Democratic legislators who’d come to Bostonafter they left theirhome state amid Republican redistricting efforts.

Healey, a Democrat, offered her support to the Texas lawmakers but also ruled out pushing for redistricting in Massachusetts.

At a news conference in the Massachusetts state House, Healey, flanked by two Texas representatives and eight senators, called Texas Republicans’ efforts to push ahead with mid-decade redistricting a “partisan, craven, political power-grab attempt” by Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton. She added that the GOP move was meant to “further an agenda that’s about protecting them and their power.”

Healey offered her “support” to the lawmakers who left Texas, though she ruled out helping fund the fines they’ll incur as a result of abandoning the in-session Legislature.

And unlike her Democratic counterparts in New York and California — Govs. Kathy Hochul and Gavin Newsom, respectively, who've said they’d move forward with efforts that would allow their blue states to possibly also conduct mid-decade redistricting — Healey said she’d let Massachusetts’ existing congressional maps stand.

“We’re going to follow the rules. We just went through a customary and orderly process just a few years age,” she said.

Massachusetts, following the process that is typical in most states, redrew its congressional maps in 2021, after the 2020 census. The redistricting process in most states occurs at the start of each new decade, when new census data is available.

“We just did that,” Healey said. “The Massachusetts maps, in my view, are fair. They were drawn after a robust process and signed into law by a Republican — Gov. Charlie Baker.”

Meanwhile, Texas state Rep. Ana Hernandez, who, like her House colleagues, has been threatened by Texas Republicans with arrest and expulsion, told reporters that when it came to those threats, “that is not what we’re concerned about.”

“When we left, it was to make sure that our constituents have a voice, because that’s what this process is doing, it’s silencing our constituents,” she said.

Trump says for now JD Vance is 'most likely' successor of MAGA movement

Trump said this afternoon that Vice President JD Vance would ""probably be favored at this point"" to take up the helm of the MAGA movement when he concludes his second term in office.

The comment came in response to a reporter's question to Trump about whether he views Vance as the ""heir apparent.""

""Well, I think most likely, in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,"" Trump said, referring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""It's too early, obviously to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,"" Trump added.

The president's remarks came after he signed an Olympics-related executive order at the White House.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has another White House meeting with Trump

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she met with Trump today at the White House.

It was the Democratic governor's third meeting with the president there this year — and fourth overall when counting their appearance at an April event to announce a new mission for a Michigan air base.

In a statement provided to NBC News, Whitmer said she told Trump “and his team about the impact tariffs are having on Michigan’s economy, especially our auto industry, the harm Michigan will face due to changes in the Medicaid program, and ongoing recovery efforts following the ice storm in Northern Michigan this year.”

Whitmer, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, has faced criticism from other Democrats for cultivating a closer working relationship with Trump. And she caught grief after a New York Times photographer captured an image of her shielding her face with folders while visiting the Oval Office in April.

Whitmer and her allies have pointed to what they see as tangible wins from her visits, including the new mission for the Selfridge Air National Guard Base and a commitment to combating invasive carp in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve always said that I’ll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan,” Whitmer said in today’s statement. “That’s why I’ve continued to go to Washington, D.C. to make sure that Michiganders are front and center when critical decisions are being made.”

She added: “I will always do whatever I can to make life a little easier for Michiganders and strengthen our economy. We should do everything in our power to lower costs and grow more good-paying jobs in Michigan. I appreciate the president’s time and attention to the matters we discussed.”

Ghislaine Maxwell’s transfer to cushy prison camp is a ‘travesty of justice,’ ex-BOP official says

Not long after it was first reported that Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to one of the cushiest federal detention facilities in the country, a private Facebook group dedicated to current and former federal prison staffers erupted in shock and outrage.

The federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, is one of seven minimum security, dormitory-style federal security facilities that do not typically hold inmates like Maxwell, 63, who are convicted of sex crimes and serving lengthy sentences.

“As a retired BOP employee, this makes me sick,” wrote one person on the “Bureau of Prisons staff and retirees” Facebook page.

“Since when are sex offenders allowed at the camp?” another wrote. “I don’t care who she snitched on, she’s a damn human trafficker.”

Trump admin ends '5 things' email requirement for federal workers

The Trump administration is officially ending the Elon Musk-led “5 Things” program, which required federal employees to send five bullet points of their work accomplishments to HR each week.

“We communicated with agency HR leads that OPM was no longer going to manage the five things process nor utilize it internally,"" U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said in a statement to NBC News. ""At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so.”

Since its inception in February, agencies have exercised discretion as to whether and how their employees should comply with the requirement, with many phasing it out entirely.

Texas state House still lacks quorum amid redistricting clash

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows quickly gaveled the state House in and out of session today, lacking the minimum number of state lawmakers to move on to regular business after dozens of Democrats fled the state in protest of a GOP-led bill that would redraw congressional boundaries to benefit Republicans.

Addressing the 94 members who attended today's session, shy of the 100 needed for a quorum, Burrows criticized Democrats and accused them of shirking their responsibilities in the wake of terrible floods that killed more than 100 people outside of San Antonio earlier this summer.

""Today, the disaster preparedness committee is meeting to consider five priority pieces of legislation. Each will address the catastrophic flooding that has devastated homes and entire communities,"" he said. ""That's the kind of important work that's being done in the House and all elected members should be here representing their districts in those conversations.”

Democrats have argued that the GOP's focus on redistricting over flood response in the early days of the special session undercuts Burrows' argument.

Democratic legislators in 3 states unveil bills banning use of face masks by ICE agents

Reporting from Boston, Mass.

A group of Democratic state legislators across three states unveiled a series of bills today that would ban the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers — an attempt to curtail the much-criticized use of such items by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As part of Trump’s promises to deport undocumented immigrants, ICE officers have ramped up their presence in cities and towns across the U.S., conducting an expanded number of raids and enforcement actions — and increasingly doing so while wearing face masks that shield their identities.

The bills from Democratic state lawmakers in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania would ban the use of such coverings. Enforcement of the laws, if enacted, would be overseen by the attorneys general in those states.

“The biggest problem is with ICE federal agents who are appearing as if they are masked militia,” New York Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy, who’s sponsored the bill in her state, said at a news conference on the sidelines of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ annual summit in Boston. “We think a dangerous line is being crossed here, and that immigration enforcement is really turning into more of a paramilitary type secret police,” she added.

Massachusetts state Rep. Jim Hawkins, who sponsored the bill in his state, said his proposal “is a step towards mending the divide and fostering trust between law enforcement and the public with transparency identification and reason.”

“There should be no need for disguises while performing their duties to the communities they serve,” he added.

“You don’t see our local police running around masked up,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Paul Friel, who sponsored the bill in his state, said. “You don’t see judges making decisions behind shields, behind the curtain. You don’t see lawmakers making bills anonymously.”

All three lawmakers acknowledged that their proposals have no support from Republicans in their legislatures. That might not be a problem in New York and Massachusetts, where Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship. But Pennsylvania’s split state government — the state has a Democratic governor and a GOP-controlled state Senate, while Democrats hold only a one-seat majority in the state House — effectively ensures no movement on the bill.

GAO says that the NIH violated law by withholding funds

The Government Accountability Office said in a report today that the National Institutes of Health ""violated"" the Impoundment Control Act by withholding funds that had been appropriated by Congress.

NBC News reported in May that an analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicated the Trump administration had cut more than $1.8 billion in NIH grants. The legality of the funding cuts is playing out in court.

The GAO, which is the watchdog arm of Congress, emphasized in its 21-page report that the president does not have ""unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.""

The report said that HHS' resumption of meetings to review grants ""alone does not ensure"" that funds were not being improperly withheld.

""If the executive branch wishes to make changes to the appropriation provided to NIH, it must propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,"" the report concluded.

Reached for comment, an HHS spokesperson relayed the department’s submitted response to GAO, indicating that the NIH has ""moved rapidly to reschedule and hold meetings impacted by the short pause, and to process grant applications."" The response also pointed to thousands of new grants issued by the NIH, which is housed within HHS.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he would consider calling a special session to reopen his state’s congressional maps.

The state is already one of the most gerrymandered in the country, with Democrats holding 14 of the state’s 17 seats.

When asked if he would consider calling a special session to redraw the state’s map, Pritzker said, “Donald Trump is a cheater, so is Gov. Greg Abbott, and Texas Republicans are carrying out their will.”

“If they’re going to cheat, then all of us have to take a hard look at what the effect of that cheating is on our democracy, and that means we’ve all got to stand up,” he said, adding that “everything’s on the table.”

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who attended the same news conference, told NBC News that his party should use “all tools at their disposal,” noting the possibility that other GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Missouri could try to change their maps, too.

Rwanda says it reaches a deal with U.S. to take in up to 250 migrants

The United States and Rwanda have agreed for the African country to potentially accept hundreds of migrants deported from the U.S., the spokesperson for the Rwandan government and an official told Reuters, as the Trump administration takes a hardline approach toward immigration.

“Rwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement, and our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation,” said the spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo.

How Trump is reshaping government data

Meteorological data collected by some weather balloons has been halted. Statistics for HIV among transgender people were scrubbed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. And basic public figures, like how many people work for the federal government, have been frozen or delayed for months.

Across the federal government, Trump has been wielding his influence over data used by researchers, economists and scientists, an effort that was playing out largely behind the scenes until Friday, when he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

GOP lawmaker says Speaker Johnson needs to 'show some leadership' and end redistricting 'chaos'

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., is calling on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to ""show some leadership"" and end the redistricting ""chaos"" that is unfolding in several states across the nation.

""The old saying is that voters should choose their representatives; representatives shouldn’t choose their voters,"" Kiley said in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. ""And I think that what’s happening right now across the country, and especially in California, is a very unhealthy thing for democracy.""

Kiley has introduced legislation in the House to nullify any new redistricting maps adopted by states before the 2030 census.

He argued the latest redistricting efforts in Texas and his home state of California are ""not a good thing for the current members of Congress, it’s not a good thing for voters, it’s not a good thing for either Democrats or Republicans, it’s certainly not a good thing for the country.""

""I think that the speaker and Leader Jeffries need to show some leadership here to bring this chaos to an end,"" he said, referring also to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

The speaker's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zelenskyy says he had 'a productive conversation' with Trump

and

Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke today, according to Zelenskyy and a White House official.

Zelenskyy said in a post to X that the call was ""productive"" and the two spoke about sanctions against Russia, aid from Europe and defense cooperation with the U.S.

""Of course, we spoke about sanctions against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in the post. ""Their economy continues to decline, and that’s exactly why Moscow is so sensitive to this prospect and President Trump’s resolve. This can change a lot.We discussed joint European decisions that can help our defense.""

The White House official did not share details on the discussion.

GOP Sen. John Cornyn urges FBI to locate or arrest Democratic legislators who fled Texas

and

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is urging the FBI to assist Texas law enforcement agencies in findingor arresting Democratic legislators who fled the state over the weekend to block a Republican redistricting plan from proceeding.

In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel today, Cornyn said he wants the FBI to aid in the efforts ""to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.""

""I request the FBI’s assistance, as federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law,"" Cornyn wrote. ""The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime. Specifically, I am concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.""

Cornyn is running for re-election next year and is facing a GOP primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who called for the arrest of the lawmakers yesterday.

There are no plans to use federal agents to arrest the Democratic lawmakers, a Trump administration official said yesterday. “Gov. Greg Abbott can handle his own state,” the official said.

House committee subpoenas the Clintons and several top former DOJ officials for testimony on Jeffrey Epstein

and

The House committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case announced it issued subpoenas today to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several top former Justice Department officials for their testimony.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said it had sent out the deposition subpoenas to the Clintons; former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Bill Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales; and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller “for testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.”

Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., also issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for “records related to” Epstein, a convicted sex offender who was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

DNC Chair Ken Martin says his party is bringing a 'knife to knife fight'

Reporting from Chicago area

AURORA, Ill. — Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said today that his party is “not rolling over” to Trump as he warned that Texas Republican attempts to go through with emergency redistricting would only spur other states to do the same.

Martin joined Gov. JB Pritzker and a throng of Texas House Democrats who have been taking refuge in the blue Midwestern state since Sunday to break a legislative quorum back home.

He pledged to help Democrats fight attempts by Texas Republicans to redraw the state political map to yield its party potentially up to five more congressional seats, a request that publicly came from the president.

“This is not the Democratic Party of your grandparents, who would bring a pencil to a knife fight,” Martin said. “This is the new Democratic Party that will bring in a knife to a knife fight.”

Democrats have said that if Texas goes through with its plan, they would attempt to take similar steps in California and potentially other states.

Trump says JPMorgan, Bank of America didn't want him as a customer

Trump told CNBC this morning that two of the nation's largest banks closed his bank accounts or rejected him as a customer.

Speaking in a wide-ranging interview, Trump said JPMorgan Chase told him he had to take ""hundreds of millions of dollars in cash"" out within 20 days. Trump then said Bank of America's CEO told him he could not open an account there despite what he characterized as its CEO's kowtowing to him ""when I was president.""

""So I went to another one, another one, another one,"" Trump said.

""The banks discriminated against me very badly, and I was very good to the banks,"" he said.

Bank of America declined to comment on the president's comments, but JPMorgan Chase said in a statement: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.”

Ex-Russian president warns enemies of ‘new reality’ as Kremlin ditches nuclear treaty

Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev has warned that the country’s rivals now faced a “new reality” as the Kremlin formally announced it was no longer bound by a treaty limiting the use of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles.

Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council and is known for issuing frequent apocalyptic threats on social media, was continuing a war of words that prompted Trump to redeploy two nuclear submarines last week.

Modi was ready to ‘make India great again,’ then Trump put America first

The U.S. and India’s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.

At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump’s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump’s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India, moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan, and mocked India’s “dead” economy.

Swiss leaders travel to the U.S. to discuss tariffs

and

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Vice President Guy Parmelin will travel to the U.S. today to discuss tariffs, the country's government said in a news release.

State Department unveils plan for travelers from certain countries to pay thousands before entering the U.S.

The State Department unveiled plans that will make travelers from certain countries to pay a $5,000 to $15,000 bond in order to visit the U.S.

The one-year program, which targets people from countries with “high visa overstay rates” and other factors, aims to prevent people from overstaying visas, according to the documented published today in the Federal Register.

Travelers would have the funds returned if they leave the U.S. on time and comply with travel permission rules.

Most affected people will be expected to pay a $10,000 bond, although the amount can be set at $5,000 or $15,000 depending on travelers’ circumstances. The program is set to go into effect Aug. 20, and the State Department will announce affected countries on its website.

The program is “intended to encourage foreign governments to take immediate action to reduce the overstay rates of their nationals when traveling to the United States for temporary visits, and to encourage countries to improve screening and vetting and the security of travel and civil documents, including in the granting of citizenship,” the document said.

The first Trump administration also initiated a temporary bond program, but the plan was not fully implemented because of the impact of the Covid pandemic on travel.

Trump says he'd 'like to run' for president again but will 'probably not'

Trump said he'd ""like to run"" for president again, though it is prohibited by the Constitution.

Asked on CNBC if he would run for president again despite the Constitution, Trump said, ""No, probably not,"" chuckling.

""Probably not,"" he continued. ""I'd like to.""

""I'd like to run,"" he repeated, going on to claim he has ""the best poll numbers I've ever had,"" and noting he won the popular vote in 2024.

Polling averages place Trump's job approval rating at 43% in recent weeks, a few percentage points higher than at the same point in the first year of his first term.

Trump says 'we are entitled to five more seats' in Texas

Trump said on CNBC that Republicans were ""entitled"" to more congressional seats in Texas, where the state GOP is pushing to redistrict the state in a way that would give an advantage to the party in next year's election.

""We are entitled to five more seats,"" Trump said.

The president pointed to gerrymandering in blue states as well, claiming that Republicans should have more seats in Congress.

Trump says E.U. imports to face 35% tariff if the bloc does not invest $600 billion in U.S.

Trump said that if the European Union did not invest $600 billion in the U.S. as he previously announced, imports from the bloc would face 35% tariffs.

The tariff rate will be set at 15% for imports from the E.U. after Trump announced a trade agreement last month.

Trump takes Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve

Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he's taking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve chair.

Trump said Bessent wants to remain at the Treasury Department.

""I asked him just last night, is this something you want? 'Nope. I want to stay where I am,'"" Trump said Bessent told him.

For Fed chair, Trump said he was considering current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and at least two other unnamed people.

Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term will end in May. Powell has come under continual criticism from Trump for not moving quicker to lower interest rates.

U.S. bans travelers from Burundi, citing 'repeated' visa violations

U.S. visas for travelers from Burundi are temporarily banned, the U.S. embassy in the East African country said, citing “repeated violations” of visa rules.

“Every Burundian who travels carries the hopes of their family and community. Respecting visa rules isn’t just personal, it is national,” the embassy said yesterday in a post on X. “Sadly, due to repeated violations, U.S. visas for Burundians are temporarily banned.”

Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, was among seven countries whose citizens were partially blocked from entering the U.S. in a June proclamation by Trump. The proclamation cited a U.S. government report saying Burundi had an overstay rate of more than 15% for business and tourism visas.

Nebraska Republican faces rowdy town hall with questions about Epstein files and fired BLS chief

and

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., held a town hall last night that started with boos shortly after he took the stage and ended with chants of “vote him out” when it ended.

In between, Flood was consistently heckled as he responded to questions about the release of more information on Jeffrey Epstein, Trump’s firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and cuts to Medicaid in the GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Rep. Adam Smith says an aide was ‘physically assaulted’ at his town hall

and

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a post on X last night that one of his staff members was “physically assaulted” during his town hall at Renton Technical College in Washington, calling it “an act that crosses every line of civil discourse.”

“Today’s town hall was intentionally disrupted to attempt to silence a democratic conversation between a Representative and his constituents,” Smith said in the post. He emphasized that while peaceful protest is protected, “violence and coordinated efforts to shut down public dialogue are not.”

Kshama Sawant, a socialist running for Smith’s seat, posted a video on X of what appeared to be individuals being handcuffed. Sawant called them “3 peaceful anti-genocide activists” who she said were merely chanting at Smith's event.

In a statement, Sawant criticized Smith's voting record on Israel: ""Adam Smith has blood on his hands. He needs to be thrown out of office and put on trial for war crimes.""

Smith's office declined further comment.

Workers Strike Back, which Sawant co-founded, shared her post, saying the activists were from their group.

A spokesperson for the Renton, Washington, police department confirmed that three people were arrested on trespassing charges. They were booked into jail, spokesperson Meeghan Black said.

Nine protesters ""took over the stage at the town hall, shouting and disrupting the meeting,"" which was then canceled by Smith, Black said. Three of the protesters refused to leave, she said, adding, ""They were warned they’d be arrested if they didn’t leave.""

""They didn’t go and were arrested,"" she said.

Two officers were at the event when it began, and other officers began to arrive an hour later, she said.

Switzerland says it will make U.S. a ‘more attractive’ trade offer

Switzerland, which was surprised to find itself facing one of the highest U.S. tariff rates in the world, says it is determined to continue talks and that it is ready to make a “more attractive” trade offer to the Trump administration.

“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking U.S. concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” its government said in a statement yesterday.

Trump said last week that he would impose a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland, below only Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%) and Syria (41%). Swiss officials said the rate is far higher than those on comparable U.S. trading partners such as the E.U. (15%), Japan (15%) and Britain (10%).

Switzerland said over 99% of U.S. goods have entered the country tariff-free since the start of last year and that its trade surplus with the U.S. is not the result of any unfair trade practices. It said it was not considering any retaliatory measures.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250802-trump-ch-1628-cb3f01.jpg",N,,2025-08-07 02:56:56.505120

Conclusion Unlike the public outcry following the first travel ban in 2017, the response to the June 2025 travel ban has been notably subdued.","Executive Summary

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban targeting 19 countries. This marks a significant expansion of the travel bans President Trump issued during his first term, and reflects a more aggressive use of the president’s authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals who would otherwise qualify to come to the United States. Media reports have confirmed the administration is weighing imposing restrictions on 36 additional countries—primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

Banning immigrants from these countries, many of whom come to the United States to reunite with family, will cause hardship and emotional stress for them and their relatives. Because many also come to study or work, it will also lead to major disruptions in higher education, labor markets in essential U.S. industries, and tax revenues and consumer spending.

The targeted immigrant groups hold significant economic clout, and the travel ban will have adverse impact on local businesses and communities across the United States. This report analyzes the scope, stated rationale, and consequences of the June 2025 travel ban, drawing on recent and historical data to assess its potential impact on the U.S. economy and on American communities and families.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 travel ban is concentrated on two regions of the world: the Middle East and North Africa; and sub-Saharan Africa. The five countries covered by the new bans (full or partial) in the Middle East and North Africa are home to 45 percent of the region’s population. The eight countries affected by full or partial bans in sub-Saharan Africa are home to 6.4 percent of that region’s population.

Additionally, the administration has signaled it may further target sub-Saharan Africa for future travel bans. Twenty-four of the 36 countries that have been identified as future ban candidates are in sub-Saharan Africa. If all 24 were to be hit with bans in the future, an additional 71 percent of the region’s population would be affected.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries Last Year?

In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 visas in categories that would be subject to the June 2025 travel ban. These included both immigrant and non-immigrant visa categories, such as tourist and temporary worker visas, and were led by visas issued to nationals of Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba.

Half of the immigrant visas issued in the categories affected by the June 2025 travel ban, 12,738, were for extended family members of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, including adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and spouses or unmarried children of lawful permanent residents. The next largest numbers were for diversity visas and employment-based visas.

Of the non-immigrant visas in the affected categories, 86.5 percent were for tourists and business travelers, followed by students (7 percent) and commercial sea or international airline crewmembers (2.6 percent).

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Bans?

The number of immigrant visas issued to the six countries most affected by the Trump administration’s previous travel bans—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—dropped by 69.9 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019, with Iran and Somalia seeing the biggest declines.

The number of non-immigrant visas issued for these six countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent, between FY 2016 and FY 2019, led by Libya and Yemen.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the 2025 Travel Ban?

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries named in the most recent travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022. These new arrivals made significant contributions to the U.S. economy. In 2023 alone, households led by these recent arrivals earned $3.2 billion in household income, paid $715.6 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These nationals made important contributions in U.S. industries that are facing labor shortages and rely on foreign-born workers. Those who worked were concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The manufacturing industry alone could face a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033.

An additional 88,900 nationals of the 36 countries that might be subjected to future travel bans also entered the United States in 2022. Households led by these immigrants collectively earned more than $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1 billion in spending power the following year.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population?

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many foreign-born individuals already living in the United States will be unable or afraid to reunite with family members living overseas. Even those who need to travel abroad will face uncertainty about whether they’ll be allowed to return.

About 4.3 million immigrants from countries affected by the ban lived in the United States in 2023, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens. More than one-third (41.8 percent) lived in Florida, followed by California, Texas, and New York.

The expansion of the previous travel bans for 19 countries—and potentially 36 more—will have far-reaching consequences for the country, disrupting family reunification, discouraging international talent from coming to the country to study and work, and threatening key sectors of the U.S. economy that depend on immigrant labor. It also undermines the economic and social contributions that long-standing immigrant communities have made across the country.

As this administration weighs future actions on the June 2025 travel ban, it is critical that policymakers pay close attention to the humanitarian and socioeconomic costs of such sweeping restrictions and hold the administration accountable for the consequences of its actions.

Introduction

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban to restrict or prohibit entry for individuals from 19 countries.

It follows a series of bans President Donald Trump enacted during his first term, beginning in 2017, when the federal government barred entry for nationals from several Muslim-majority countries. That first ban set off protests at airports, sparked a flurry of court challenges, and underwent multiple revisions before a final version was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. Two years later, the administration added six additional countries to the ban, citing purported national security and screening concerns. The Biden administration fully repealed the ban in January 2021.

The newly implemented travel ban targets a greater number of countries and has a broader geographic scope than the earlier bans. But it bears structural similarities to the previous iteration—specifically in exemptions like for legal permanent residents—that was upheld by the Supreme Court and has a slower roll-out period, a combination that could make it harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

Days after the new travel ban took effect on June 9, reporting revealed that the Trump administration had written an internal memo about the possibility of adding 36 more countries—primarily in Africa—to the travel ban list, if they are unable to meet the U.S. government’s requirements on vetting and screening within 60 days. The U.S. Department of State has reportedly indicated that a nation’s willingness to accept third-country nationals deported from the United States will play a factor in the decision.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce declined to discuss the specifics of the cable. However, she confirmed that the administration is urging countries to strengthen their passport vetting procedures, cooperate in accepting deported nationals from the United States, and take additional measures to ensure their citizens do not pose a threat to American security.

The June 2025 travel ban, and its potential expansion, have broad implications for immigrant communities. Reports have already emerged about children unable to reunite with their parents in the United States, foreign doctors kept away from patients awaiting them in U.S. hospitals, and immigrant entrepreneurs hesitating to take international trips needed for their businesses. This report examines how this ban will have consequences that ripple across American society.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 order imposes a full ban on twelve countries. Individuals from these countries cannot seek either an immigrant visa, which results in lawful permanent residency after entry to the United States, or any non-immigrant visas, which are temporary in nature and for specific purposes like tourism, work, or study.

It imposes a separate, partial ban on an additional seven countries. People from countries under the partial ban may be eligible for certain non-immigrant visas only. They will still be banned from all immigrant visas as well as some non-immigrant visas.

People with current visas are exempt from the new travel ban, along with other groups, including legal permanent residents; dual nationals; immediate relatives (spouses, minor children, or parents) of U.S. citizens; refugees; Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders; and members of athletic teams traveling for major sports events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The 19 countries included in the June 2025 travel ban were home to about 429.6 million people—roughly 5.3 percent of the world’s population—in 2023. Thirteen of these countries, or 68 percent, are in Africa and the Middle East. Combined, the populations of the affected countries made up 45 percent of the total population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and 6.4 percent of the total population of sub-Saharan Africa.

Adding the 36 countries being considered for the travel ban would add 1 billion people to the affected population. These countries include a higher representation of sub-Saharan Africa, with 24 of the 36 making up 71 percent of the region’s population.

Furthermore, the administration will have the option to add or remove countries from the list of banned nations. Starting on September 2, 2025 (90 days after the announcement of the June 2025 ban), the secretary of state can forward recommendations to the president every 180 days with any suggested adjustments to the order. As a result, the number of people ultimately affected by the ban could fluctuate.

What Are the Stated Justifications for the Travel Ban?

In the text of the June 2025 order enacting the travel ban, the Trump administration gives three main reasons for targeting the 19 countries: inadequate vetting and information sharing; high rates of visa overstays; and recalcitrant countries refusing to accept their nationals who have been ordered deported from the United States. Specifically, the order claims that 10 of the 19 countries conducted inadequate vetting and information-sharing; 15 had high overstay rates; and eight were recalcitrant.

While the first justification, claiming inadequate vetting and information sharing, has legal precedent—affirmed by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii—the others are new and are arguably questionable. To start, existing immigration law already provides mechanisms to address recalcitrant countries, such as visa sanctions. This proclamation appears to bypass those statutory tools in favor of a more aggressive use of presidential authority.

Next, the connection between visa overstay rates and the imposed restrictions is often tenuous. For example, the administration bans the issuance of immigrant visas for several countries based solely on non-immigrant overstay rates, even though immigrant visas are intended for permanent immigrants and are therefore not subject to overstays.

Moreover, the administration’s claims rely on Department of Homeland Security estimates that have faced criticism for failing to accurately reflect unrecorded departures or instances where individuals legally extended or adjusted their immigration status. The government is limited in its ability to match immigration records across agencies, leading to some individuals falsely being deemed “suspected overstays.”

Finally, most of the countries cited for high overstay rates (all but Haiti and Venezuela) actually have a relatively small number of overstayers that is likely an overcount: In FY 2023, an average of 545 people per country reportedly overstayed their visas. As an example, Chad, with a population of over 19 million, had only 451 suspected visa overstays in FY 2023.

Exemptions in the current travel ban raise additional questions. While the ban exempts immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who can prove identity through DNA, it denies similar flexibility to individuals in other family-based categories, such as the children of green card holders or the siblings of U.S. citizens.

Taken together, these inconsistencies cast doubt on the ban’s stated purpose of improving vetting and reducing visa overstays. The policy’s overinclusive design sweeps in individuals whose entry poses no clear risk, while its exceptions allow many others to continue entering the country—undermining the administration’s own security rationale. Rather than a narrowly tailored national security measure, the ban appears to function primarily as a tool to restrict immigration from countries disfavored by the administration.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries?

In FY 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 immigrant and non-immigrant visas to nationals of the affected countries in the categories that would be subject to the new travel ban, excluding immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, and visas covered by the exemptions. These visas included 68,557 visas issued to individuals from countries under the full travel ban and 93,430 visas issued to countries under the partial travel ban. The highest number of visas were issued to nationals of Venezuela (39.4 percent), followed by Iran (12.6 percent), and Cuba (10.7 percent).

The number of all visas issued included 25,086 immigrant visas: 14,263 to people from the 12 countries under the full travel ban; and 10,823 to people from the seven countries under the partial travel ban.

About 51 percent (12,738) of the immigrant visas were issued in the family-based categories, including adult children and siblings. The greatest number of these were to people from Cuba (5,540), Yemen (1,714), and Haiti (1,485).

More than one-third of the immigrant visas (42 percent) were diversity visas, granted through lottery to people from countries with low immigration rates. These primarily went to people from Sudan, Iran, and Cuba. Just 4.7 percent were employment-based immigrant visas, for individuals sponsored by a U.S. business, notably to nationals of Venezuela and Iran.

In the same fiscal year, the U.S. government issued 136,901 non-immigrant visas to people from these countries: 54,294 to individuals from countries subject to full visa restrictions; and 82,607 B-1, B-2, F, M, and J visas to individuals from countries under the partial travel ban.

About 86.5 percent of the non-immigrant visas were B-1 and B-2 visas, for visitors like tourists, business travelers, and those visiting family temporarily, with Venezuela and Iran receiving the largest number.

F visas, for international students, made up 7 percent of non-immigrant visas issued to affected countries; D visas, for crewmembers (workers on commercial sea vessels or international airlines), made up 2.6 percent; J visas, for exchange students and scholars, comprised 1.9 percent; and K visas, for the fiancés of U.S. citizens, comprised 1.3 percent. These are diverse groups of people who would not have been allowed into the country had they entered after June 9, 2025, constituting an abrupt shift that would disrupt international tourism and transportation, hurt educational and cultural exchanges, and separate families.

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Ban?

To fully understand the implications of the June 2025 travel ban, it’s essential to revisit the effects of the travel ban issued by the first Trump administration.

The executive order was signed on January 27, 2017, and went into effect mere hours after the text was published. Within 24 hours, around 375 travelers were affected, with 109 people detained while in transit and 173 people prevented from boarding flights to the United States before a court blocked the order. Within the first seven days, the State Department said, “roughly 60,000 individuals’ visas were provisionally revoked.” The ban was later revised, going through four iterations during the first Trump administration. The third version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, and in 2020 a fourth version added six more countries. Many of these countries saw their visa issuance drop significantly, even before the COVID-19 pandemic heavily restricted international travel.

The third version of the travel ban had targeted eight countries, although Venezuela was included only in a limited form, banning travel for government officials and their families; and Chad was removed in 2018 after the White House claimed that the country improved its information-sharing and identify-management practices.

The remaining six countries—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were under a broad travel ban for at least 30 months, until the Biden administration repealed it in January 2021. These six countries bore the brunt of the ban and are the focus of the Council’s subsequent analysis.

Between FY 2016 and FY 2019, the total number of immigrant visas issued to nationals of these six countries dropped by 69.9 percent. Iran saw the biggest decline, of 79 percent, from 7,727 visas to 1,634 visas, while Yemen’s visa issuance dropped to one-third of its FY 2016 level, from 12,998 visas to 4,379 visas.

The issuance of non-immigrant visas to these countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019. Under a full travel ban, Iran saw the number of non-immigrant visas issued to its nationals fall from 29,404 in FY 2016 to 4,244 by FY 2019, a decline of approximately 85.6 percent. Meanwhile, Libya, under a partial travel ban, experienced a drop of business and tourism visas issued to its nationals from 1,445 to 96.

The relatively few visas that were issued in this time period were due to the limited exemptions and waivers set for the previous travel ban, such as the exemptions for dual citizens and representatives of international organizations.

Meanwhile, these sharp declines in visa issuance highlight the immediate and profound impact of the administration’s travel ban.

Because the first Trump administration’s travel ban primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries—and was sometimes known as the “Muslim Ban”—it may have affected travel decisions throughout the Middle East. For instance, research from 2017 revealed that after the first travel ban, tourism from the Middle East to the United States dropped by one-quarter.

If tourists were anxious about traveling to the United States, so, too, apparently were students. A study of two Texas universities found that the 2017 travel ban significantly reduced the number of applications from international graduate students, especially those from Muslim-majority nations. Most notably, the universities experienced more than a 50 percent drop in applications from nationals of the seven countries specifically named in the first version of the travel ban. Prior research also revealed that the previous travel ban alarmed international doctoral students, leading to stress, confusion, and worries about travel, visa stability, and future job prospects.

International students often fill critical gaps in the workforce—particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields—furthering the ability of American researchers and businesses to succeed. Policies that limit their ability to study and work in the United States not only hamper local economies but also hamstring the research and innovation pipelines in American universities and companies—ultimately undermining U.S. global competitiveness.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the June 2025 Travel Ban?

While government records provide the most up-to-date counts of visa issuance, their insights into the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of those new arrivals are limited. To fill in the gaps, we use the latest American Community Survey (ACS) microdata, from 2023, which provides detailed information about the non-citizens who entered the United States in 2022 and lived in the country in the following year. This approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the populations most directly comparable to those who will likely be affected by the new travel restrictions.

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries targeted by the June 2025 travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022.i

About 69,700 nationals of countries named in the full travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with the majority from Haiti (34.9 percent), Afghanistan (33 percent), and Iran (17.4 percent). About 228,900 people from countries named in the partial travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with almost all from Cuba (65.2 percent) and Venezuela (33.8 percent).

At least 5 percent of these new arrivals, or 15,700 people, were enrolled in colleges and universities in 2023. This population represents a significant pipeline of international talent tapped by American businesses and organizations.

About 34 percent of the new arrivals had already received at least a bachelor’s degree, and 10 percent held an advanced degree.

Banning people like this from coming to America to study, work, and reunite with family will not only cause hardship; it will also lead to a loss in tax revenues and consumer spending that could support local American businesses and communities.

In 2023 alone, households led by recently arrived nationals of the affected countries earned $3.2 billion in income, paid $715.6 million in combined federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These new arrivals were also more likely to be of working age than U.S.-born residents, and, as such, were key contributors to the U.S. labor force. About 77 percent were between the ages of 16 and 64, compared with 60.9 percent of the U.S.-born population, and most worked.

These new arrivals had an employment rate of 82.8 percent, helping to ease critical labor shortages in America’s vital industries.

These workers were mostly concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The June 2025 travel ban threatens to exacerbate labor shortages in these industries, many of which have trouble recruiting enough U.S.-born workers and rely on foreign-born employees.

The most common occupations for these new arrivals included construction laborers (6.1 percent), cooks (4.3 percent), truck drivers (3.7 percent), maids and housekeeping cleaners (3.7 percent), and janitors and building cleaners (3.3 percent)—jobs vital to the construction, transportation, and hospitality industries.

The manufacturing industry alone is projected to experience a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033. Meanwhile, construction laborers, janitors and building cleaners, and cooks are among the top occupations with the most potential for job growth between 2023 and 2033; they are projected to add 115,400, 75,800, and 244,500 jobs, respectively.

In 2023, there were already 1.7 job openings for every available worker nationwide, with an aging population expected to exacerbate the labor crisis. A drop in the number of new arrivals due to the June 2025 travel ban could further strain the workforce, hindering business growth, destabilizing wages, and intensifying inflation—raising prices for goods and services for American consumers.

Furthermore, 88,900 people from the 36 countries that may soon be added to the travel ban entered the United States in 2022; 24.1 percent were from Nigeria, 18.6 percent were from Ghana, and 9.2 percent were from Ethiopia.

Collectively, households led by nationals of these 36 countries who arrived in 2022 earned $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1.0 billion in spending power in the year after their arrival. Placing more countries on the new travel ban would significantly amplify the economic consequences.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population and the U.S. Economy?

In 2023, about 4.3 million immigrants from the 19 countries named in the June 2025 travel ban lived in the United States, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens and 1.9 million non-citizens.

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many of these people will not be able to see family members living abroad. Even those who need to travel internationally will have to worry about whether they can return.

Under the June order, existing visas cannot be revoked, but those who need to leave the United States and renew their visas after they expire could be subjected to the ban instead of being allowed to return.

Foreign-born residents from Cuba make up the largest share of those affected by the June 2025 travel ban, with over 1.4 million individuals: 832,600 naturalized citizens and 598,900 non-citizens. Haiti follows with 775,000 foreign-born residents, 58.8 percent of whom are naturalized citizens. Venezuela ranks third, with 766,400 individuals, while Iran and Afghanistan have 421,600 and 226,100 people, respectively. Myanmar and Laos also have sizable numbers, particularly among naturalized citizens.

The majority of foreign-born residents from the affected countries (60.9 percent) have been in the United States for at least a decade, building their lives and raising families.

These immigrants and their families hold significant economic clout. In 2023 alone, households led by immigrants from the affected countries earned $175.7 billion in income and paid $45.3 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. After taxes, they retained a spending power of $130.4 billion, money used to pay for food, housing, and supplies from American businesses, fueling broader economic activity across the country.

Households headed by Cuban immigrants stood out, with $12.3 billion in tax contributions and $39.6 billion in spending power, followed by households headed by immigrants from Iran and Haiti, who combined paid $17.9 billion in taxes and held $45.8 billion in spending power.

Nearly 95 percent of immigrants from the countries affected by the June 2025 travel ban were employed in 2023, most often in healthcare (16.3 percent), professional services (11.7 percent), transportation and warehousing (11.1 percent), manufacturing (10.3 percent), and retail trade (10.3 percent).

These foreign-born residents were heavily concentrated in a few key states. In 2023, 41.8 percent of immigrants from the affected countries—including both recent arrivals and long-term residents—lived in Florida, an immigrant hub due to its established support networks, economic opportunities, and proximity to countries like Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela.

California, Texas, and New York also have significant populations, together making up nearly a quarter of the immigrant population from the affected countries. The travel ban’s effects—such as family separation, labor shortages, and reduced tax contributions and consumer spending—will be felt most acutely in these regions.

If the administration expands the travel ban to the 36 additional countries listed in the leaked memo, the shocks will be even more far-reaching. About 2.2 million foreign-born residents from those countries lived in the United States in 2023, including 1.4 million naturalized citizens. The following year, households led by these foreign-born residents collectively earned more than $107.3 billion in income, paid $29.1 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $78.1 billion in spending power.

Conclusion

Unlike the public outcry following the first travel ban in 2017, the response to the June 2025 travel ban has been notably subdued. However, this muted reaction does not mean the public approves.

Legal advocates and civil rights organizations remain engaged, but many are stretched thin by a dizzying volume of immigration-related challenges, from visa revocations to arrests and deportations. Additionally, the more deliberate rollout of the June 2025 ban—with exemptions and a publicly announced implementation timeline—has both removed the element of surprise that fueled the 2017 backlash and made the ban harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

However, this quieter reception should not obscure the policy’s far-reaching implications. The expanded scope of the June 2025 ban means it will affect an even larger and more diverse population, and it will bring significant consequences for American families, educational institutions, and labor markets. The absence of mass protests should not be mistaken for the absence of harm.

Furthermore, the ban—and its consequences—may be expanded even further, with 36 more countries under consideration and the potential for more to be added at each mandated 180-day review.

Each country added to the ban compounds the strain on American communities, institutions, and economies. A broad ban not only deepens the economic and humanitarian consequences already observed but also threatens to undermine U.S. diplomatic relations and global standing. This underscores the urgent need to ensure that future decisions are grounded in evidence, aligned with national interests, and mindful of the broader socioeconomic costs.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-passengers-1024x385.png,N,,2025-08-07 02:57:03.434336

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”, established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while maintaining ultimate congressional oversight.
The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably require congressional legislation.
The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.","Donald Trump is threatening to strip Washington DC of its local governance and place the US capital under direct federal control, citing what he described as rampant youth crime following an alleged assault on a federal employee who worked for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president said he would “federalize” the city if local authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults.

“Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run.”

The threat received backing from Elon Musk, after the billionaire described an incident in which a member of the Doge team was allegedly “severely beaten to the point of concussion” while defending a woman from assault in the capital.

“A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC,” Musk posted on X. “A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC.”

The victim was identified by friends and the police as Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old known as “Big Balls”, one of Doge’s most recognizable staffers who joined Doge in January. He reportedly left in June, and is currently employed at the Social Security Administration. According to a police report obtained by Politico, Coristine was assaulted at approximately 3am on Sunday by about 10 juveniles near Dupont Circle.

Police arrested two 15-year-olds from Maryland, a boy and a girl, as they attempted to flee the scene, and charged them with attempted carjacking. A black iPhone 16 valued at $1,000 was reported stolen during the incident.

Trump’s post, which included images of a bloodied and shirtless Coristine, concluded: “If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”, established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while maintaining ultimate congressional oversight. No president has attempted to revoke this arrangement since its creation.

Trump’s threat could theoretically take several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law enforcement officers or national guard troops under executive authority, as he did during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside the White House over local officials’ objections.

But fully stripping the city’s home rule would probably face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Any such move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could block or attempt to challenge in federal courts.

The president targeted DC’s juvenile justice system specifically. “The Law in D.C. must be changed to prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting at age 14,” he wrote, referring to alleged attackers he described as “local thugs” and putting the word “youths” in quotation marks.

Washington DC, with a population of about 700,000, has seen violent crime decline in the first half of 2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low, according to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.

The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c7d4709cd11f9a042d85495903f4fab17c50033/240_0_3587_2870/master/3587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b68f4772fae6ec44a999ab424301bede",N,,2025-08-07 02:57:07.708745

The big picture: An April Department of Homeland Security notice stated that recipients were prohibited from ""limiting commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies"" in order to qualify for assistance, but this wording was not included in a later August version outlining the terms and conditions for FEMA applicants.

The latest: The change became apparent after the DHS pushed back on Axios' earlier report on the matter via a post to X.

What they're saying: DHS did not immediately answer Axios' questions on when and why it changed its terms and conditions, but the URL indicates it was in August.

However, a DHS spokesperson told Axios, ""There is no FEMA requirement tied to Israel in any current [Notice of Funding Opportunity]. No states have lost funding, and no new conditions have been imposed.""

The spokesperson added, ""FEMA grants remain governed by existing law and policy and not political litmus tests. DHS will enforce all anti-discrimination laws and policies, including as it relates to the BDS movement, which is expressly grounded in antisemitism. Those who engage in racial discrimination should not receive a single dollar of federal funding.""

State of play: States rely on these funds to cover search-and-rescue equipment, emergency manager salaries and backup power systems, among other expenses, according to a Reuters analysis.

The requirement targets the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led movement advocating for Palestinian rights and ""urges action to pressure Israel to comply with international law,"" per its website.

At least 34 states passed anti-BDS laws between 2014 and 2023, according to a University of Pennsylvania law journal report.

Representatives for emergency and disaster agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment earlier on Monday.

Why it matters: The decline followed protests over the waves of raids by masked immigration agents in June — particularly in Southern California — that led to court orders that have hindered some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, at least for now.
By the numbers: ICE agents booked an average of 990 arrests per day from July 1 to July 27, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).
That was down from an average of 1,224 daily arrests in June — and well short of senior White House adviser Stephen Miller's stated goal of at least 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

Another factor in the falling arrest numbers: Trump's own flip-flop on whether to pause raids targeting the agriculture and hospitality industries.

Meanwhile, removals of immigrants from the U.S. rose in July to an average of 84 more per day compared to June. NBC News reported that more than 18,000 immigrants were removed in June.

By the numbers: ICE agents booked an average of 990 arrests per day from July 1 to July 27, according to data collected by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).

That was down from an average of 1,224 daily arrests in June — and well short of senior White House adviser Stephen Miller's stated goal of at least 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

The Trump administration appears to have backed off that goal — at least in court.

In a case challenging expedited removals of immigrants, a Justice Department attorney told the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week that ICE leadership hasn't been directed to meet any numerical quota for arrests, Politico first reported.

The 56,945 people currently in ICE custody also mark a slight decrease from the 57,861 detainees reported four weeks earlier, according to the TRAC data.

State of play: The stepped-up campaign of raids that began in June — dubbed the ""Summer of ICE"" by immigration activists — generated protests across the nation.

The raids, in which masked agents in plain clothes swept into communities to make arrests, left many immigrants no choice but to abandon their children, their vehicles, work tools and family dogs and cats.

U.S. citizens — many of them Latinos — reported being detained for various periods by immigration agents in what critics say were instances of racial profiling and overzealous policing.

Last month, immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of deliberately targeting brown-skinned individuals in Southern California as part of its crackdown.

A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court's order halting many of the tactics the administration has been using in immigration stops and arrests in Southern California.

What they're saying: The Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin confirmed to Axios that arrests were down in July but said they were only down 10% — from 31,000 in June to 27,000.

""Despite a historic number of injunctions — including the (temporary restraining order) in Los Angeles — ICE continues to arrest the worst of the worst,"" McLaughlin said.

""From gang members and terrorists to pedophiles, everyday ICE is removing these barbaric criminal illegal aliens from American communities. Secretary [Kristi] Noem has been clear: nothing will stop us from carrying out the President and American people's mandate to carry out the largest deportation of criminal illegal aliens in American history.""

Variety has reached out to Comedy Central for comment on Homeland Security’s decision to use “South Park” to promote ICE.

It remains unclear whether or not the ICE-related footage in the “South Park” teaser will actually be included in the upcoming episode, as series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone often create new episodes of “South Park” in the days leading up to airtime so they can be as timely as possible. The duo recently admitted that a Season 27 trailer that dropped in April included footage created specifically for the promo and not from actual episodes in the season.

“South Park” Season 27 kicked off July 27 with an explosive episode that made national headlines for targeting Trump. The premiere featured the president begging for sex from Satan and included a Deepfake-assisted PSA where Trump stripped naked. The PSA ends with the slogan: “Trump. His penis is teeny-tiny, but his love for us is large.”

Trump’s White House blasted the “South Park” in a statement after the premiere, saying: “This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”

In responding to the Homeland Security tweet, the official “South Park” X account posted: “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks.”

And the Department of Homeland Security did not provide the family a reason for Go’s release, Joseph said. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously described Go in a statement as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed her visa that expired more than two years ago.

Go, who lives in Scarsdale, New York, with her mother, Kyrie Kim, came to the U.S. for Kim’s work. Kim, who became the first woman ordained in the Seoul Diocese of the Anglican Church of Korea, had been invited to develop the Episcopal church’s connection to Asian communities, said Mary Rothwell Davis, an attorney for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where Go’s mother is a reverend.

“It was an initiative to begin a new ministry, reaching out to Asian clergy, Asian families, and … to help strengthen and grow that aspect of our Episcopal and Anglican community,” Davis said, just hours before Go’s release. “Rev. Kim is the person who was chosen to do that.”

Go, a rising sophomore at Purdue, had a smooth, uneventful visa hearing, Davis said, and was given a date to return to court.

“Everything seemed to go perfectly well,” Davis said. “So she had no idea this was coming. None.”

Davis said she has seen the visa herself and was unsure why McLaughlin had claimed Go overstayed her visa.

“We have no idea why they are alleging this, because we have a piece of paper that says she has a visa till December 2025,” Davis said. “This is what lack of due process does. We have evidence on our side. They’re making allegations. We are not being given the opportunity to sort it out.”

Go’s detention drew massive backlash across faith and local New York communities. Over the weekend, friends, loved ones and more gathered in downtown Manhattan to rally around the student. Davis said that as Go was being transferred to Louisiana from the facility in New York, she caught a glimpse of the supporters.

“She was leaving the building by bus, and she saw the Episcopal Diocese rally that was taking place in front of the courthouse,” Davis, who’s been in constant communication with the family, said. “It was very bittersweet.”

New York Assemblymember Amy Paulin, who spoke to Go on the night of her release, said in a statement that she is “overjoyed” that so many individuals spoke out for Go.

“The pain, fear, and uncertainty she and her family endured over the past five days should never have happened,” Paulin said in the statement. “But tonight we celebrate her freedom and the strength of a community that refused to stay silent.”

Kim told reporters that though she’s relieved that her daughter is back home, it’s also critical to remember that many others continue to contend with circumstances similar to Go’s detention.

“There’s more who need the support,” Kim said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250805-Yeonsoo-Go-ch-1047-e7e5f5.jpg",N,,2025-08-06 08:56:29.720950

DHS’ attempt to cherry-pick Bible verses to justify its policies is a battle it can’t win.","Ostentatious religiosity is often an attempt to overcompensate for some decidedly less-divine behavior. The Trump administration’s draconian deportation regime’s defending such evil with Bible verses is a recent example of this timeless tradition.

Twice in the past month, the Department of Homeland Security has posted Bible-themed propaganda on its social media accounts. Isaiah 6 was the first passage DHS bastardized. As images of helicopters and tactical agents ominously scroll, the narrator says: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I; send me.’”

The Department of Homeland Security has posted Bible-themed propaganda on its social media accounts.

The second hype video mirrors the first. Dark images of militaristic immigration enforcement actions are paired with Proverbs 28: “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.”

In addition to the Bible memes, another recent DHS social media post displayed the painting “American Progress” with the caption “A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.” The 1872 painting is one the most famous images of Manifest Destiny, which gave a religious justification to the unchecked westward expansion of the United States and the genocide of Indigenous people.

These posts come as DHS begins a hiring spree to add an additional 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel authorized by the megabill Trump signed into law July 4.

Why the sudden biblical references from the militarized Trump immigration machine as it creates a concentration camp in Florida? As the brutal cruelty and injustice behind its actions comes more clearly into view, perhaps it feels the need to give the rank and file a sense of religious fervor.

Imbuing millions of deportations with a divine mandate acts as a sort of pre-emptive pardon for actions that would otherwise be condemned by basic morality. Nothing girds the conscience like saying you’re on a mission from God.

DHS’ Bible craze also arrives at a time when the department is facing increasingly vocal opposition from a broad spectrum of religious groups in the United States.

A growing number of Americans are souring on Trump’s deportation policies, according to an NBC News analysis of recent polling.

A fourth lawsuit from religious groups was filed last week in federal court demanding that ICE stop desecrating houses of worship by storming in to make immigration arrests. There’s already a federal order in place preventing ICE from targeting a group of Baptist, Quaker and Sikh houses of worship on religious freedom grounds. When the National Guard and the Marines were needlessly deployed in Los Angeles, faith groups protested. And Leo XIV, the first American pope, has consistently criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

There is growing pressure on DHS to release two clergy members, Imam Ayman Soliman and Maryland pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal, from immigration detention. Soliman served as a chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital before his asylum status was revoked. Fuentes Espinal pastored for 15 years and was detained for overstaying his visa. A growing number of Americans are souring on Trump’s deportation policies, according to an NBC News analysis of recent polling.

From “Alligator Alcatraz” to a South Africa refugee resettlement plan that reportedly welcomes only white people, the Trump administration’s blatant cruelty stands in stark contrast to the message of welcome consistent across faith traditions.

DHS’ attempt to cherry-pick Bible verses to justify its policies is a battle it can’t win. Anyone who has a basic understanding of the Bible understands that God’s concern for immigrants and refugees is clear throughout Holy Scripture. No fewer than 92 verses in the Old Testament refer to the Hebrew word for immigrant. In the New Testament, Jesus makes it clear that how we welcome immigrants is a reflection of how we would welcome him.

The Trump administration officials who created this propaganda either don’t understand basic concepts in the Bible or are attempting something much more sinister. What if they do understand the consistent call across faith traditions to welcome immigrants? What if they understand it so deeply that they need to create this propaganda to muddy the waters? The religious appeal would then become less than some benign Christian nationalism and morph into a state-sponsored attempt to undermine a core religious teaching.

Let’s be clear: U.S. immigration enforcement agents aren’t on a religious mission.

Let’s be clear: U.S. immigration enforcement agents aren’t on a religious mission. Implying so undermines the secular nature of government. But there’s more going on here: invoking God’s name is a desperate attempt to sanctify an agenda that is abominable.

DHS’ Bible-quoting recruitment video is a confession of moral bankruptcy. A government confident that its policies are just wouldn’t need to borrow God’s authority to sell them. By wrapping itself in scripture, the Trump administration has only confirmed what its critics, including many devout believers, have been saying all along: This deportation crackdown isn’t a divine mandate, it’s a national disgrace, and faith communities will not be fooled into blessing it.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250718-noem-ch-0909-3d7863.jpg",N,,2025-08-06 08:56:35.228883

Gretchen Whitmer published Tuesday is asking her to reject federal grant funding for new immigration enforcement detention centers in Michigan.

The letter was drafted by the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition following the July announcement of a nationwide support grant program operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with $608 million for the construction of new centers like Florida’s “Alligator Alacatraz.” Opponents have called the facility’s conditions inhumane, but it has been lauded by supporters of President Donald Trump and his administration’s immigration policies.

More ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ centers to be built by states flush with cash, experts predict

With the Florida facility already facing lawsuits challenging rights violations, as well as prisoner reports on the lack of food and water at Alligator Alcatraz, the No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition is asking Whitmer to back away from any deal offering federal money to build new centers in Michigan.

“Conditions such as these are endemic to the U.S. immigration detention system. They will only worsen as the Trump administration continues its push for an unprecedented expansion of the detention and deportation machine, with increasing reports nationwide of death, medical neglect, discrimination, abuse, and punitive transfers,” the letter said. “We know that whatever new prisons are built will come with their own incentives to be filled, and that the continued growth of this cruel apparatus represents a key facet of an emboldened white nationalist program.”

The federal government has already allocated more than $150 billion for immigration enforcement, which includes money to reopen previously-shuttered prisons, including the former North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan.

Now referred to as the North Lake Processing Center, it was a federal immigration-only prison beginning in 2019. It was shut down in 2022 but reopened with an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract in June of this year. The facility is now the largest ICE detention center in the Midwest and one of the largest in the nation.

Advocates noted that immigration raids in Michigan have escalated in frequency in recent months, which trends with the reopening of the Baldwin center. They have also cited Whitmer’s lack of a public commitment to not participate in FEMA’s grant program. The coalition said it had concerns that the state-funded Michigan Works! employment agency has collaborated with the Florida-based GEO Group on hiring staff for the North Lake center.

The letter also urged Whitmer to ensure that Michigan Works! no longer collaborates with GEO Group.

“The Trump administration’s current attempt to weaponize FEMA as an additional tool of mass imprisonment and deportation is emblematic of a white supremacist agenda that prioritizes the sadistic scapegoating of immigrants over the provision of resources needed for all people’s safety and flourishing,” the letter to Whitmer said.

Richard Kessler, a member of the coalition that sent the letter, said the last thing Michigan needs is more prisons – for immigrants or otherwise.

“It’s already unacceptable that Michigan Works! is funneling taxpayer money and resources toward the GEO Group so they can cash in on tearing families apart and locking up our immigrant neighbors in Baldwin,” Kessler said in a statement. “The news about FEMA is another reminder that private prisons aren’t the only problem. What allows companies like GEO to swoop in and profit from suffering is the agenda set by the federal government. And it’s very clear to us that this administration will go after immigrants with whatever methods they can.”

Whitmer’s office deferred comment to the Michigan Department of Corrections.

Jenni Riehle, public information officer, said the North Lake Correctional Facility located in Baldwin is owned and operated by the GEO Group, a privately-owned company.

“The federal Department of Homeland Security has contracted with this facility,” Riehle said. “The facility has never been owned or operated by the State of Michigan, or the Michigan Department of Corrections, and the state of Michigan has no authority over its operations.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6669-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 04:56:40.369931

But that too had to be reworked when the High Court ruled the cohort could not be treated punitively.
In the interim, the government has promised the High Court that the man would not be removed from Australia until his case was resolved.
It is unclear when the High Court will make a judgement in the case.
""It must demonstrate that respect by following this direction from the UN Human Rights Committee and halting these deportations.""","The United Nations has urged Australia to halt plans to deport a man to Nauru while it investigates the human rights implications of his case.

Australia is seeking to deport three people released under the NZYQ decision to the tiny Pacific nation in exchange for an undisclosed payment but their removal has been stalled since February due to court challenges.

The men, one of whom has a prior murder conviction, were among a group of hundreds released into the community following the High Court's dramatic 2023 ruling that their indefinite detention was unlawful.

The United Nations' Human Rights Committee wrote to the Australian government last week requesting the deportation of one of the trio be halted while they consider his complaint to the body, which was submitted days earlier.

It cannot compel the government to follow its direction, which it issued as an interim measure while the matter is under investigation.

""The principle is simple; if your visa is cancelled, you have to leave Australia,"" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement.

""That's a pretty consistent principle, applied in every functioning immigration system around the world.""

But the Human Rights Law Centre, which is representing the man, argues the government has an international legal responsibility not to deport people to places where they might be killed or suffer inhumane treatment.

Their complaint to the United Nations on behalf of their client argued that sending him to Nauru breached this obligation because he would not be able to access adequate medical treatment, would be separated from his family, could face violence or discrimination and there is no guarantee the Nauruan government would not deport him back to Iraq, where he faces the risk of persecution.

""This insidious plan affects more than just three people. It shows the Albanese government believes that some people in this country deserve fewer rights than others, and deserve repeated, lifelong punishment,"" associate legal director Josephine Langbien said.

""These deportations would set a dangerous new baseline for how all migrants and refugees can be treated. We must demand better from our political leaders.""

Nauru deal first test of new laws

In February, the government announced it had struck a deal with Nauru, which offered to grant visas to members of the NZYQ cohort in exchange for payment.

The group — many of whom were convicted of violent offences but have served their sentences — were previously being kept indefinitely in Australian immigration detention because they had failed character tests but also had no reasonable prospects of deportation.

That was until the high court's landmark decision in the case of one man, identified only as ""NZYQ"", triggered the cohort's release into the community.

The judgement sent the government scrambling to find an alternative solution, which included attempts to monitor the cohort using ankle bracelets and curfews. But that too had to be reworked when the High Court ruled the cohort could not be treated punitively.

Announcing the deal with Nauru, Mr Burke said he expected that more than the three men would eventually be deported after the initial legal challenges were cleared.

It is the first test of the new laws that the government passed last year to strengthen its powers to send people without a visa to a third country for resettlement.

In the interim, the government has promised the High Court that the man would not be removed from Australia until his case was resolved.

Court documents show he was convicted of a crime and sentenced to a total of five years' jail before being released on parole and taken into immigration detention.

His lawyers argue the ruling about his visa was not made lawfully. It is unclear when the High Court will make a judgement in the case.

""The Albanese government claims to respect international law and urges other countries to do the same,"" Ms Langbien said.

The agreement cleared the way, for now, for Mr. Suri to return to his job and life at the university, where he has also taught undergraduates, even as his case challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to remove him from the country moves forward.

Most immediately, the settlement headed off a hearing scheduled for Friday in which Mr. Suri’s lawyers were set to argue that the Trump administration should reinstate records of his legal status in a Department of Homeland Security database and cease efforts to deport him. Officials had terminated those records in March, claiming without evidence that he had worked to spread “Hamas propaganda” on Georgetown’s campus.

Mr. Suri, an Indian national, had previously faced detention in an immigration facility in Texas as one of a handful of prominent students and academics the Trump administration detained in a wave of arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators in March. The arrests and threatened deportations of legal immigrants on campuses have set off a series of court clashes, with judges freeing many of those targeted, and raised fears that the Trump administration is chilling free speech.

Like several others, including Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, Mr. Suri was abruptly arrested by masked immigration agents and shuttled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a number of facilities in Virginia and Louisiana in what his lawyers have said in court was an attempt to prevent them from immediately locating him.

Unlike some who took on more visible roles in campus demonstrations, Mr. Suri appears to have been arrested based on a vague combination of social media posts and his association with his wife, a U.S. citizen whose father, Ahmed Yousef, formerly served as a senior political adviser to the Hamas leadership in Gaza.

Mr. Suri was never charged with a crime and said in a statement after his arrest that he had “never even been to a protest.”

In May, a federal judge ordered Mr. Suri released from detention in Texas, and a federal appeals court allowed him to remain free while he continued litigation fighting for his ability to remain in the country on constitutional grounds.

By terminating Mr. Suri’s records, the government also jeopardized the legal status of his two children, whose student status remains tied to Mr. Suri’s.

As part of the deal on Tuesday, the government agreed not to terminate his children’s records and to provide at least 21 days’ notice before acting again based on “newly discovered, independent legal grounds” for canceling those records in a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

While Mr. Suri and his contemporaries at other schools who faced arrests on similar grounds have notched a string of legal wins, the more overarching fight over the Trump administration’s student deportation policy is only just now reaching a crescendo.

The question of whether the Trump administration abused its power in seeking to deport a number of like-minded student demonstrators over their criticism of the Israeli government was the focus of a two-week trial before Judge William G. Young in Boston in July.

Lawyers in that case had argued that the administration set a policy of pursuing “ideological deportations” against those students in violation of their freedom of speech and association. The groups suing also filed a post-trial brief summarizing that argument on Tuesday evening.

But Judge Young expressed some skepticism throughout the trial that the Trump administration had misused the narrow but real power afforded to the secretary of state to cancel noncitizens’ visas or even to designate green card holders deportable. He is expected to rule in the coming days.

The “one-in, one out” deal coming into effect on Wednesday will see migrants ineligible to stay in the UK sent back across the Channel, in exchange for taking those who have links to Britain.

But the terms of the treaty indicated that migrants who had arrived in the UK via small boat could frustrate attempts to deport them to France, as the agreement contains a clause that says in order for people to be returned to France the UK must confirm they do not have an “outstanding human rights claim”.

Critics have argued this could risk bogus applications being made to frustrate the deportation process and cause delays.

But speaking to Sky News on Wednesday morning, cabinet minister Lisa Nandy claimed this was not the case, instead saying human rights cases would be heard in France.

""The deal that we've struck will allow people with us to send people back to France who have human rights claims”, the culture secretary said.

“Those claims will be heard in France. So I know that the Conservative Party has been saying that this is a loophole. It isn't, and we're really confident about that.""

However, Home Office sources said that migrants with an ongoing human rights claim would not be removed from the UK until their claim is complete in UK courts.

If, however, a claim hasn’t been commenced then an individual can be removed, with any further legal challenges being dealt with in the French courts.

It is also understood that people with claims that have been ruled as unfounded can be removed even where there is a possibility of future legal challenge.

The row came after shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the treaty offered “an easy loophole for lawyers”, adding that “France will not give us any data on the people they are sending our way… so we have no idea who they really are”.

On Tuesday, borders minister Dame Angela Eagle hit back at his remarks, claiming that the clause was included “precisely to ensure no-one can use ‘clearly unfounded’ human rights claims to avoid being returned”.

She added: “And we will do full security checks on any applicants, and reject anyone who poses a risk.”

The treaty also appears to give France and other EU member states an effective veto over which individuals are returned, as well as stating that the UK will pay all costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France.

“If France considers that an individual would be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen States...France shall refuse the readmission request”, the document says.

When the agreement was announced by Sir Keir Starmer in joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, the prime minister said it was a “breakthrough moment” which would “turn the tables” on the people smugglers who bring them here.

This week home secretary Yvette Cooper conceded that the accord is not a “silver bullet” to stop small boat crossings, but said it marked a step change as migrants will be sent back across the Channel for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, she declined to put a number on how many people would be returned under the agreement ahead of time, saying that she believed it could aid criminal gangs.

She added: “We will provide regular updates, people will be able to see how many people are being detained, how many people are being returned, and it is right that we should be transparent around that.”

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal would likely result in only small numbers of migrants being swapped with France and is “not going to make any difference whatsoever”.

Asked whether the Conservatives were partly to blame for the immigration and asylum situation, she told reporters: “No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.”

Bruno Retailleau, France’s interior minister, said the agreement “establishes an experimental mechanism whose goal is clear: to smash the gangs”.

The treaty was ratified on Monday, meaning that anyone entering the UK on a small boat can be detained immediately on arrival and returned to France by the UK government – with the Home Office expecting detentions to begin within days.

The EU Commission, Germany and other member states have also given the green light to the agreement - quashing previous concerns that the bloc could oppose the deal.

Immigration Enforcement have set aside space at immigration removal centres, the government said, while Border Force have an operational strategy ready to identify and process groups of inadmissible migrants for removal.

The Home Office also said it had learnt lessons from the lengthy legal challenges which hampered the Tories’ failed Rwanda scheme, saying it is “prepared to robustly defend any legal challenges to removal within the initial trial phase”.

Labour has put a pledge to crack down on the number of people coming to the UK on small boats at the centre of its plan for government.

But with boat crossings at a record high, and the asylum backlog still above 75,000, there is mounting pressure on ministers to take more drastic action - pressure which is exacerbated by the success of Reform UK in the polls.

Last week figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel topped 25,000 – the earliest point in a calendar year at which the 25,000 mark has been passed since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018.

It comes amid escalating protests across the UK opposing the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with a number of people arrested after a protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf in London on Sunday.

In Democratic-leaning states, by contrast, ICE is frequently arresting immigrants from worksites, streets and mass roundups that have sparked protests and intense backlash in cities such as Los Angeles. Most of those arrested don’t have any criminal record.

The ICE data shows that overall, more immigrants are being arrested in red states than blue states – both in the community and, especially, in prisons and jails. But there is a clear divide in where ICE is apprehending people: 59% of arrests in red states took place in prisons and jails, while 70% of arrests in blue states took place in the community. That partisan gap between red and blue states existed before Trump’s second term began – but it has widened since last year.

Trump officials say the differing tactics are simply a downstream effect of sanctuary policies in many Democratic-controlled states and large cities, which can limit prisons and jails from cooperating with ICE. In many of those states, local authorities can’t hold immigrants in custody based on ICE orders alone – so they’re often released before immigration officials can arrest them.

“Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want, more agents in the communities and more worksite enforcement,” Trump border czar Tom Homan told reporters last month. “Why is that? Because they won’t let one agent arrest one bad guy in a jail.”

But advocates for immigrant rights say the community arrests – from raids at factories and restaurants to surprise detentions at ICE check-ins – are punitive measures aimed at instilling fear in blue states and cities.

The aggressive tactics reflect “a deliberate federal strategy to punish Massachusetts and other immigrant-friendly states for standing up against Trump’s reckless deportation machine,” argued Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based nonprofit that represents immigrants in court.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on CNN’s analysis.

The divide is especially dramatic in Massachusetts, where 94% of immigrants arrested by ICE were apprehended in the community, and 78% of them had no criminal record.

The state has a court decision and local policies that limit law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. The agency’s regional office was also led until March by Todd Lyons, who is now the acting ICE director, and who has described the focus on community arrests in Massachusetts, his home state, as a direct response to sanctuary policies.

“If sanctuary cities would change their policies and turn these violent criminal aliens over to us, into our custody, instead of releasing them into the public, we would not have to go out to the communities and do this,” Lyons said at a press conference in June.

Regardless of the cause, the varying local laws and ICE tactics are creating a “patchwork system” across the country, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute.

Immigrants are facing “really divergent outcomes based on where people live,” she said.

Different playbooks for arrests

CNN’s analysis is based on ICE records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Deportation Data Project, a research group associated with the UC Berkeley law school. The analysis covers the period since Trump took office through late June.

In its annual reports, ICE defines arrests in two categories: those that happen in prisons and jails, and “at-large” arrests in the community. In prisons and jails, ICE typically sends a detainer request to corrections officials for undocumented inmates, and then agents come to the facilities to arrest them before they leave custody.

Community arrests, by contrast, include everything from workplace raids to teams trailing and apprehending immigrants.

In 2024, under President Joe Biden – whose administration said it was prioritizing arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records – about 62% of ICE arrests were from prisons and jails, while 27% were in the community, the data shows.

So far in Trump’s term, arrests overall are up, and the balance has changed: 49% have been in prisons and jails, and 44% in the community.

But those percentages diverge widely between the 31 states won by Donald Trump and the 19 states won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, which have similar total undocumented populations, according to 2023 estimates from the Center for Migration Studies, a nonprofit.

In the Trump-voting states, ICE is not only more likely to arrest immigrants already in custody, but they’re also more likely to have a record: 41% of those arrested in red states had a prior criminal conviction, compared to 36% of immigrants arrested by ICE in Harris states. Most prior convictions are for lower-level crimes like traffic offenses, immigration violations and other non-violent charges, a CNN analysis of internal ICE data found earlier this summer.

In part, that disparity comes from how states and cities without sanctuary policies respond to ICE detainer requests. In most red states, those detainers are honored, allowing ICE to pick up thousands of undocumented immigrants directly from jail or prison.

But in many blue states and cities, sanctuary policies direct officials to refuse ICE detainer requests without a court warrant. Some states go further in limiting local police’s collaboration with ICE: Boston prevents officers from even asking about immigration status, for example.

The ICE data suggests that some sanctuary policies are blocking the agency from arresting immigrants – to a point.

In Mississippi, for example, which has banned the establishment of sanctuary policies in the state, 87% of immigrants ICE filed a detainer request for through the end of May were later arrested by the agency in prisons and jails. In New York, which has state and local policies limiting cooperation with ICE, only 4% of the immigrants that ICE had requested detainers for were arrested in prisons and jails.

So in blue states, the Trump administration has instead relied more on a different policy: immigration raids and community arrests. In Los Angeles, where those raids sparked unrest earlier this summer, Trump deployed the National Guard. The administration later sued the city for its sanctuary policies, saying the city was contributing to a “lawless and unsafe environment.”

Many activists, though, say the nature of those blue-state raids – and especially ICE’s efforts to promote and publicize them – show they serve a broader purpose beyond just evading sanctuary policies.

Those aggressive tactics are “shocking and they’re such a departure from the norm,” Bush-Joseph said. “But their intent might be more so about deterrence and trying to dissuade people from coming to the US-Mexico border, as well as trying to get people to self-deport.”

Overall, ICE’s arrest and detention machine may just be ramping up. The recent budget reconciliation bill signed by Trump includes billions in new funding for the agency. And a growing number of local and state law enforcement agencies – largely in red states – are signing up for an ICE program that allows them to help enforce immigration laws.

Massachusetts neighborhoods seeing impact of ICE arrests

ICE’s embrace of public arrests is particularly pronounced in Massachusetts.

While Massachusetts doesn’t have a formal sanctuary law at the state level, a 2017 state supreme court ruling bans law enforcement from holding anyone beyond the time they would otherwise be released on the basis of an ICE detainer request. Boston and several other cities also have policies that go further, preventing law enforcement from coordinating with ICE more broadly.

Lyons, the acting ICE director, led the Boston ICE office – which is responsible for arrests in Massachusetts and five other New England states – before being elevated to his current role. In interviews and statements, he’s decried sanctuary policies in the state.

“Boston’s my hometown and it really shocks me that officials all over Massachusetts would rather release sex offenders, fentanyl dealers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and child rapists back into the neighborhoods,” he told reporters this summer – without addressing the fact that a large majority of immigrants arrested in the state this year had no criminal convictions.

In May, ICE carried out what officials described as the largest enforcement operation in the agency’s history, arresting more than 1,400 people in communities across Massachusetts. Around New England, other high-profile cases have included ICE officers detaining a Tufts PhD student who co-wrote a student newspaper op-ed critical of Israel and smashing the window of an immigrant’s car and yanking him out of the passenger seat in front of his wife.

ICE’s aggressive tactics in the region have been defined by “a general level of mean-spiritedness and brutality,” said Daniel Kanstroom, a Boston College law professor who founded the college’s immigration and asylum law clinic. “We’ve never seen masked agents before. We’ve never seen students arrested for writing op-eds before. We’ve never seen people dragged out of immigration court before.”

Stepped-up community arrests are having a marked impact on immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in the Boston area, local advocates say. In suburbs like Chelsea and Everett, which have large Salvadoran and Central American communities, some immigrants are staying home out of fear of ICE raids.

“We’re seeing people not going to their doctor’s appointments, kids not going to school, folks not going grocery shopping,” said Sarang Sekhavat, the chief of staff at the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition. “You’re seeing a lot of businesses in some of these neighborhoods really suffering because people just don’t want to leave home… bustling, active neighborhoods that have become very quiet now.”

ICE’s dragnet has picked up people like Geovani Esau De La Cruz Catalan, who was arrested by immigration agents on the street outside his Chelsea home in June – just days after he crossed the stage at his high school graduation.

The 20-year-old, who has no criminal history, came to the US from Guatemala in 2022. He told CNN his hopes to build a new life in America were dashed when he was detained.

“I thought they were going to take away all the dreams I had,” De La Cruz said in Spanish. “I was in shock.”

De La Cruz spent two weeks in ICE custody before being released with a future immigration court date. His stepmother, Mayra Balderas, said he has a work permit, but it’s unclear whether he’ll be allowed to stay or deported back to Guatemala.

Balderas, an American citizen who immigrated to the US more than three decades ago, said ICE agents were frequently patrolling her Chelsea neighborhood, something she’d never seen before Trump took office.

“Since I’ve been here, I never have any experience like that – going into the neighborhoods and pulling people and doing what they’re doing,” Balderas said. “They are scaring people.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-07-17t173959z-413476354-rc2cofai6u1w-rtrmadp-3-migration-usa-new-york-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-06 04:56:56.328203

They want to shelve the dispute at least until Trump leaves office, pointing to a potential conflict should a state court seek to exercise authority over the nation’s top executive. The case is in Florida because Trump and one of the board members live here.

A state trial judge and the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal rejected that argument, ruling there was no need to delay adjudication of the case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that presidents were not immune from lawsuits against themselves while in office.

Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.

At trial and before the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals, the Pulitzer board had argued the case should be dismissed or at least halted until Trump leaves office. Trump, who brought the case, argues the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.

“When the president is a willing participant, courts do not risk improperly interfering with the essential functioning of government,” the the 4th DCA concluded.

“The president — by virtue of his exceptional position — is uniquely equipped to determine how to use his time, to assess the attention a lawsuit will require, and to decide whether the lawsuit will divert him from his official business. When an officeholder chooses to initiate litigation, courts must assume the officeholder already has weighed the burdens on their official duties.”

Pulitzer attorneys argue that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts they believe could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as president.

In a Tuesday filing in the Supreme Court, Trump’s attorneys counter that the high court should decline review because the lower courts “chartered no new territory, the issues are unlikely to recur, and petitioners’ arguments are so obviously wrong.”

“The two courts below resolved Petitioners’ motion to stay the litigation against them on the not-so-novel proposition that a party generally lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights of others,” Trump’s St. Petersburg-based lawyers wrote.

“This Court only has jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary review of a district court’s opinion when the court below ‘construes’ a constitutional provision. Since that did not occur in this case, this Court must decline review,” Trump’s attorneys wrote.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Trump-pointing-ottumwa-_-jay-waagmeester-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 03:56:34.065418

That list followed President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list.

The DHS list prompted confusion from some jurisdictions and outcry from local sheriffs, and was subsequently taken off line within a few days.

The Department of Justice also published a list of “sanctuary jurisdiction characteristics,” which include public declarations of sanctuary status; local laws or rules limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and restrictions on information about “immigration status of detainees with federal authorities” to name a few. The DOJ notes the jurisdictions included in Tuesday’s list “were made after a thorough review of documented laws, ordinances, and executive directives by the listed jurisdictions. This initial list of designated Sanctuary Jurisdictions will be reviewed regularly, to include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws. Each state, county, and city will have an opportunity to respond to its placement on the list.”

Sanctuary studies

As of the beginning of July, 34 cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, had asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda, including Albuquerque (Santa Fe is already part of the suit).

Filings for that suit note that Albuquerque “has been a welcoming city” since 2000, when the city council passed “its first immigrant-friendly city resolution,” which states that “municipal resources cannot be used to apprehend individuals solely on the basis of their immigration status, unless required by law.”

On July 21, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller signed an executive order reaffirming the city’s position as an “immigrant-friendly city,” as some members of the City Council said they would push further protections in city ordinances later this year.

New Mexico’s largest city affirms ‘immigrant-friendly’ status

“In the face of federal actions and proposals that undermine human rights and respect, sow fear and destabilization among our families, and damage our economy and threaten our public safety, the City of Albuquerque reaffirms its moral, legal and policy duty to uphold civil rights, public safety and serve all residents with dignity,” Keller said during a signing event for the order.

In a news release announcing the new USDOJ list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement that “sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design. The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

A statement provided to Source NM by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s Director of Communications Michael Coleman said the Trump administration’s “designation of Albuquerque as a sanctuary city invites the same kind of federal overreach we’ve seen play out disastrously in cities like Los Angeles. Gov. Lujan Grisham fundamentally opposes this administration’s approach to indiscriminate detention and deportation. It’s cruel, inhumane, and unconstitutional.”

The question remains, Coleman’s statement continued, as to “how the City of Albuquerque plans to manage this situation. Those questions should be directed to the mayor’s office. The Lujan Grisham administration will continue fighting unconstitutional federal overreach in court. But right now, what Albuquerque needs most is for [the Albuquerque Police Department] to focus on real crime in real neighborhoods across the city—not to get pulled into immigration enforcement battles that distract from public safety.”

Source requested comment from Keller on Albuquerque’s inclusion on the list and received a statement from him that said: “Albuquerque is a welcoming city and where crime is now actually going down in every category this year.

X’s design choices and opaque practices continue to pose human rights risks that demand greater accountability, not just scrutiny.
Amnesty International is calling for effective regulatory enforcement and robust accountability measures to address the systemic harms created by X’s design choices.","Social media platform X, formerly Twitter, played a central role in the spread of false narratives and harmful content which contributed to racist violence against Muslim and migrant communities in the UK, following the tragic murder of three young girls in the town of Southport, Amnesty International has established in a technical explainer which was published today.

A technical analysis of X’s open-source code (or publicly available software) reveals that its recommender system (or content-ranking algorithms), which drives the “For You” page, systematically prioritizes content that sparks outrage, provokes heated exchanges, reactions and engagement, without adequate safeguards to prevent or mitigate harm.

“Our analysis shows that X’s algorithmic design and policy choices contributed to heightened risks amid a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-migrant violence observed in several locations across the UK last year, and which continues to present a serious human rights risk today,”

Pat de Brún, Head of Big Tech Accountability at Amnesty International.

On 29 July 2024, three young girls – Alice da Silva Aguiar, Bebe King and Elsie Dot Stancombe – were murdered, and 10 others injured, by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana. Within hours of the attack, misinformation and falsehoods about the perpetrator’s identity, religion, and immigration status flooded social media platforms, and were prominent on X.

Amnesty International’s analysis of X’s open-source recommender algorithm uncovered systemic design choices that favour contentious engagement over safety.

X’s algorithmic ranking system, revealed in X’s own source code published in March 2023, reveals that falsehoods, irrespective of their harmfulness, may be prioritised and surface more quickly in timelines than verified information. X’s “heavy ranker” model – the machine-learning system that decides which posts get promoted – prioritizes “conversation” – regardless of the nature of the content. As long as a post drives engagement, the algorithm appears to have no mechanism for assessing the potential for causing harm – at least not until enough users themselves report it. These design features provided fertile ground for inflammatory racist narratives to thrive on X in the wake of the Southport attack.

Further analysis of the system also uncovered built-in amplification biases favouring “Premium” (formerly Blue) verified subscribers whose posts are automatically promoted over those of ordinary users. Before official accounts were shared by authorities, false statements and Islamophobic narratives about the incident began circulating on social media. Hashtags such as #Stabbing and #EnoughisEnough were also used to spread claims falsely suggesting the attacker was a Muslim and/or an asylum-seeker.

An account on X called “Europe Invasion”, known to publish anti-immigrant and Islamophobic content, posted shortly after news of the attack emerged that the suspect was “alleged to be a Muslim immigrant”. That post garnered over four million views. Within 24 hours, all X posts speculating that the perpetrator was Muslim, a refugee, a foreign national, or arrived by boat, were tracked to have an estimated 27 million impressions.

The Southport tragedy occurred in the context of major policy and personnel changes at X. Since Elon Musk’s takeover in late 2022, X has laid off content moderation staff, reinstated previously banned accounts, disbanded Twitter’s Trust and Safety advisory council, fired trust and safety engineers and restored numerous accounts which had been previously banned for hate or harassment, including that of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist better known as Tommy Robinson.

Inflammatory posts

Tommy Robinson told his 840,000 X followers that there was “more evidence to suggest Islam is a mental health issue rather than a religion of peace” further stoking hostility against Muslims.

X’s owner Elon Musk – who has 140 million X followers on his personal account – also notably amplified the false narratives that were exchanged regarding the Southport attack. On 5 August 2024, as the riots were spreading, he commented on a video posted by Ashley St Clair, saying “civil war is inevitable.”

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer intervened, calling for the protection of Muslims amid waves of targeted attacks by mobs on mosques, refugee shelters and Asian, Black and Muslim communities.

In response, Elon Musk publicly retorted: “Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?”

Amnesty International’s analysis shows that in the two weeks following the Southport attack, Tommy Robinson’s posts on X received over 580 million views – an unprecedented reach for a figure banned on most mainstream platforms for breaching hate speech rules.

We wrote to X to share our findings in a letter dated 18 July 2025 and provided the company with an opportunity to respond. The company had not responded by the time of publication.

Time for Accountability

Amnesty International’s analysis of X’s design and policy choices raises serious concerns about how the platform’s recommender system functions in crisis situations. The way the system weighs, ranks, and boosts content, particularly posts that generate heated replies or are shared or created by “blue” or “premium” accounts, can result in harmful material being shared with larger audiences.

“Without effective safeguards, the likelihood increases that inflammatory or hostile posts will gain traction in periods of heightened social tension.

Pat de Brún.

Where such content targets racial, religious and other marginalized groups, this can create serious human rights risks for members of these groups. X’s failure to prevent or adequately mitigate these foreseeable risks constitutes a failure to respect human rights.

Whilst regulatory frameworks such as the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) and the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) now establish legal obligations for platforms to assess and mitigate some systemic risks, these obligations must be robustly enforced to have any effect. X’s design choices and opaque practices continue to pose human rights risks that demand greater accountability, not just scrutiny.

Amnesty International is calling for effective regulatory enforcement and robust accountability measures to address the systemic harms created by X’s design choices. The UK government must also address remaining gaps in the current online safety regime to hold platforms like X accountable for broader harms caused by their algorithms.

A new immigration detention camp just opened in Florida.

The conditions at the camp are, reportedly, “horrible.” Prisoners are denied water and food for long stretches; the food they are given has pests in it. The lights are kept on 24/7, I assume to keep the prisoners awake. Prisoners aren’t allowed to bathe.

Even if you have a zero-tolerance policy toward violating immigration law, that doesn’t automatically justify jailing all your suspects, and it could never justify such conditions. This treatment is unsafe, unsanitary, unconstitutional and unconscionable.

The camp is part of the Trump administration’s policy of mass deportation. The White House set a quota of 3,000 new detainees per day nationwide. Government agents are attempting to meet this target via widespread racial profiling, arresting random brown people off the street —- often with no pre-existing suspicions about their actual immigration status, no evidence demonstrating they require jailing. Legal residents and U.S. citizens have been imprisoned and removed from the country in this dragnet.

But also, many of those arrested who did enter the country illegally have lived here peacefully for years; most have committed no crimes since arriving. In fact, research shows that immigrants generally commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born people, and that crime doesn’t rise (there’s evidence it may actually decrease) in communities where immigrants settle. Nor is crime rising in the U.S overall. Quite the opposite: Crime’s been going down for decades. As Pew Research states: “Both the FBI and [Bureau of Justice Statistics] data show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s.”

So using the supposed “danger of crime”, whether by immigrants or in general, as an excuse for these civil and human rights violations, is deceitful. Worse, it’s fear mongering to justify ethnic cleansing in America.

Dame Angela Eagle denied the agreement with France would allow for spurious claims to be used to avoid deportation after shadow home secretary Chris Philp questioned the wording of the document.

The “one-in, one out” deal coming into effect on Wednesday will see migrants ineligible to stay in the UK sent back across the Channel, in exchange for taking those who have links to Britain.

The agreement contains a clause that says in order for people to be returned to France, the UK must confirm they do not have an “outstanding human rights claim”.

Critics have argued this could risk bogus applications being made to frustrate the deportation process and cause delays.

Mr Philp said on Tuesday this section offered “an easy loophole for lawyers”, adding that “France will not give us any data on the people they are sending our way… so we have no idea who they really are”.

Borders minister Dame Angela said he was wrong, and that the clause was included “precisely to ensure no-one can use ‘clearly unfounded’ human rights claims to avoid being returned”.

She added: “And we will do full security checks on any applicants, and reject anyone who poses a risk.”

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper conceded earlier that the accord is not a “silver bullet” to stop small boat crossings, but marked a step change as migrants will be sent back across the Channel for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, she declined to put a number on how many people would be returned under the agreement ahead of time, saying that she believed it could aid criminal gangs.

She added: “We will provide regular updates, people will be able to see how many people are being detained, how many people are being returned, and it is right that we should be transparent around that.”

Speaking to reporters earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal would likely result in only small numbers of migrants being swapped with France and is “not going to make any difference whatsoever”.

Asked whether the Conservatives were partly to blame for the immigration and asylum situation, she told reporters: “No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.”

It has been reported that about 50 a week could be sent to France. This would be a stark contrast to the more than 800 people every week who on average have arrived in the UK via small boats this year.

The lawsuit between the administration and top state and city of Denver officials is ongoing in federal court.","The Trump administration again took aim at Colorado on Tuesday, calling the state a “sanctuary” for people not authorized to be in the country.

In a new list issued by the Justice Department, Colorado and Denver are listed with the designation of “sanctuary jurisdiction,” among 35 counties, cities and states and the District of Columbia nationwide.

And in an updated complaint filed in a lawsuit against Gov. Jared Polis, state Attorney General Phil Weiser, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and the Denver Sheriff Elias Diggins, federal attorneys cited the Caroline Dias Goncalves case as proof the state is still unfriendly to the federal government’s efforts to step up deportations.

Dias Goncalves was pulled over in Mesa County earlier this summer by a sheriff’s deputy, who then notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a Signal chat that she may be in the country without authorization. She was eventually pulled over by ICE and detained for more than two weeks.

Weiser has since sued that deputy for cooperating with ICE, and the Mesa County Sheriff has sanctioned him, though he criticized state officials for their actions.

The federal government also thinks the state is wrong to seek sanctions against a deputy cooperating with ICE.

“When officers choose to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies to keep their communities safe and enforce federal law, the state of Colorado hauls them into court as punishment for doing their jobs,” the updated complaint in USA v. Colorado said.

Federal attorneys also called out a new law passed earlier this year that broadened the group of state and local employees prohibited from sharing Coloradans’ personal information with immigration officials for the purposes of deportation.

Now, in addition to law enforcement officers, pretrial officers and pretrial services office employees are now on the list of employees covered by the statute.

“This hampers local law enforcement’s ability to arrange interviews between federal immigration authorities and inmates,” the lawsuit said. “The … bill severely restricts employees from collecting or sharing information with federal immigration enforcement authorities.”

In the new “sanctuary” list released by the U.S. Department of Justice, the administration argued that state and Denver policies jeopardized the safety of U.S. citizens.

“Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi, in a statement. “The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

Weiser had no comment on the updated list due to the pending litigation. A spokesman for the Denver mayor, Jon Ewing, said, “And here we thought the Trump Administration didn’t like lists!”

“Denver protects the rights of all residents while enforcing federal, state, and local law. Any suggestion otherwise is untrue,” Ewing noted in an email.

The Tuesday sanctuary list is updated from a May effort that included more of Colorado’s cities and counties. Then a number of counties embarked on a heavy lobbying effort to remove themselves from the list, including El Paso County, and it was amended.

Within a short time, the May list was scrapped entirely by the Trump administration and the Justice Department started over. The list currently has no implications beyond the court of public opinion, but could eventually be cited as justification for denying or clawing back federal funds.

The list draws curious distinctions between communities, though every place in Colorado is bound by the same state laws.

Denver does not allow ICE agents to access non-public areas of the jail, for example, as is the policy in several other counties. Denver, like other counties, also won’t hold people beyond the posting of bail or the expiration of their sentences strictly at the request of ICE on civil immigration violations. That’s state law, and it is followed across Colorado. But only Denver, where Trump won less than 21 percent of the vote in the 2024 election and officials have been vocal about welcoming newcomers, was singled out.

On Tuesday, El Paso County, which was not included in the most recent sanctuary list, didn’t have anything fresh to say about it. They re-released a statement from May, when members of Congress and local leaders worked with the Department of Justice to remove themselves from the initial sanctuary list.

“We are working to reverse Colorado’s sanctuary laws, and we are fully collaborating with ICE officials, as state statute allows. Together, we have provided testimony, called attention to the rising crime rate, and fortified El Paso County as an anti-sanctuary,” said spokeswoman Natalie Sosa, in a statement. “Let us be clear, we will not pander to Denver politicians, whose political agenda has made Colorado less safe for everyone.”

Major categories of crime have fallen across the state in recent months, including in Denver.

The “one-in, one out” deal coming into effect on Wednesday will see migrants ineligible to stay in the UK sent back across the Channel, in exchange for taking those who have links to Britain.

The agreement contains a clause that says in order for people to be returned to France, the UK must confirm they do not have an “outstanding human rights claim”.

Critics have argued this could risk bogus applications being made to frustrate the deportation process and cause delays.

Mr Philp said on Tuesday this section offered “an easy loophole for lawyers”, adding that “France will not give us any data on the people they are sending our way… so we have no idea who they really are”.

Borders minister Dame Angela said he was wrong, and that the clause was included “precisely to ensure no-one can use ‘clearly unfounded’ human rights claims to avoid being returned”.

She added: “And we will do full security checks on any applicants, and reject anyone who poses a risk.”

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper conceded earlier that the accord is not a “silver bullet” to stop small boat crossings, but marked a step change as migrants will be sent back across the Channel for the first time.

Speaking to the BBC, she declined to put a number on how many people would be returned under the agreement ahead of time, saying that she believed it could aid criminal gangs.

She added: “We will provide regular updates, people will be able to see how many people are being detained, how many people are being returned, and it is right that we should be transparent around that.”

Speaking to reporters earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal would likely result in only small numbers of migrants being swapped with France and is “not going to make any difference whatsoever”.

Asked whether the Conservatives were partly to blame for the immigration and asylum situation, she told reporters: “No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.”

It has been reported that about 50 a week could be sent to France. This would be a stark contrast to the more than 800 people every week who on average have arrived in the UK via small boats this year.

It is co-published here with permission.

Since federal agents descended onto Los Angeles streets in early June, several United States citizens have been detained and held in immigration detention centers. A Capital & Main review of local reporting, video and social media posts found at least nine citizens were taken into custody by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection after protesting near or observing immigration raids in the Los Angeles area since June 6. Two are currently facing federal charges.

Job Garcia arrived at the Home Depot in Hollywood for his delivery gig for another company on the morning of June 19 expecting to have a regular day. But moments later, Garcia—a U.S. citizen—was tackled, arrested and detained by federal agents.

Garcia said he spotted vans pulling into the store’s parking lot, and began filming as federal agents started breaking the window of a truck with a man sitting behind the wheel. Videos taken by Garcia and other bystanders show several masked men in green vests that read “POLICE” and “U.S. Border Patrol” approach Garcia and tackle him to the ground.

More from Capital & Main

“Give me your fucking hand! You want it, you got it,” one agent said. “You want to go to jail? You got it.”

The agents took Garcia to Dodger Stadium, where he told Capital & Main he was held for hours before being transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A. The federal prison’s basement has been turned into a detention facility for people apprehended by federal immigration enforcement officers, where civil rights advocates say detainees are being kept in grossly overcrowded, dungeon-like conditions. One of the Border Patrol agents who detained Garcia is the same man who was subsequently arrested and charged with assaulting a Long Beach police officer and resisting arrest in a separate incident, according to Capital & Main’s review of the footage. “This matter is under investigation,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to Capital & Main.

“This is a case of Border Patrol and ICE essentially punishing citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights. It goes against the values of this country,” said Ernest Herrera, an attorney at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who is representing Garcia in a claim against Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, and ICE. “It looks more like the behavior of a crackpot military dictatorship in a different country. But it’s here. This is happening right now in our country.”

It’s unclear how many U.S. citizens federal agents have arrested since undertaking a series of immigration raids in Southern California starting in June. Federal officials did not answer Capital & Main’s questions about the detention of U.S. citizens.

“Threats or acts of violence toward law enforcement officers will NOT be tolerated,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, adding that Secretary Kristi Noem “has made it clear: If you threaten or attempt to harm a law enforcement officer, we will find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.”

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the law firm Public Counsel, said that ICE agents are not permitted to detain citizens. “Are they permitted to do that? Absolutely not, absolutely not. But in Los Angeles, citizens … are carrying around their passports in order to substantiate that they are citizens.” Rosenbaum is representing Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups who are suing the Department of Homeland Security. The complaint alleges that the agency has unconstitutionally arrested and detained people in order to meet arbitrary arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

In a landmark decision in the case on July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that the roving immigration patrols were conducted without reasonable suspicion of lawbreaking, and that the government was denying detainees access to counsel.

In at least three instances reviewed by Capital & Main, Los Angeles Police Department officers were present as federal agents took U.S. citizens into custody. Immigration rights and press freedom advocates have pointed to officers establishing traffic blocks around immigration raids and officers’ brute force during anti-ICE protests as evidence of collaboration with federal immigration agents. The LAPD has prohibited its officers from initiating action to determine someone’s immigration status since 1979.

Many immigration raids and protests have occurred in Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado’s district.

“We don’t want our local government to look like the oppression that’s coming from our federal government. … It may not look like we’re getting a lot of answers and sometimes the answer is we don’t have one yet,” Jurado said of LAPD’s actions.

“This is the way a democracy dies. … Local officials should not be handmaidens to the federal government,” Rosenbaum said.

The Guardian reported that U.S. immigration officers have made false and misleading statements in their reports about several Los Angeles protesters they arrested during protests. The Justice Department has charged at least 26 protesters, but prosecutors have been forced to dismiss at least nine cases.

The ongoing raids led a group of six California Republican state legislators to send a letter to President Donald Trump asking for ICE and DHS to change course.

“We have heard from employers in our districts that recent ICE raids are not only targeting undocumented workers, but also creating widespread fear among other employees, including those with legal immigration status. This fear is driving vital workers out of critical industries, taking California’s affordability crisis and making it even worse for our constituents,” the legislators said in their letter.

“No one wants to be caught up in the pathway of those raids because it could compromise the family as a whole,” California State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh told Capital & Main. “From what we’ve heard and understood is that they don’t want to be exposed to that so they won’t send their children to school or they won’t go to work because they don’t want to be placed in a scenario where the family could be compromised.” She supports removing undocumented people who have been classified as public safety threats, and advocates that California rescind a state law that prevents state and local law enforcement agencies from using their resources to investigate or arrest people for federal immigration enforcement purposes.

Garcia and other citizens who were detained said they and their families are both dealing with considerable trauma.

“My mom was so relieved to see me. She had not slept,” Garcia said. “I’ve had nightmares multiple times of being arrested again. I see a lot of these officers. I know their faces.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23333/download/Cap%20and%20Main%20080525%20home.jpg?cb=026ac4d5fd1dd43bb65d662ebdfefeb6&w=717,N,,2025-08-06 03:56:44.251980

President Donald Trump’s administration argued that Oklahoma state law violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to find the statute invalid.

Oklahoma Attorney Gentner Drummond, a Republican, whose office represents the state and public officials in litigation, filed a motion Tuesday in support of the lawsuit.

Attorneys for the Department of Justice argued that the law extends eligibility for in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants while not extending that treatment to U.S. citizens in other states.

“This unequal treatment of Americans is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law, which expressly provides that ‘an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident,’” the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit references executive orders from the Republican president, this year that “emphasize that federal and state governments must not grant greater benefits to individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States than to American citizens.”

Oklahoma is one of 23 states and Washington D.C. that provides in-state tuition and financial aid benefits to undocumented students, according to an analysis by the Higher Education Portal, which is a platform for data, resources and policy analysis regarding immigrant student populations.

Oklahoma law allows requires in-state tuition be offered to anyone who graduates high school in the state and resides in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation.

The lawsuit also argues that under the law, undocumented immigrants are eligible. Students who meet the residency requirements and provide one of Oklahoma’s colleges and universities with their application or a petition to legalize their immigration status can be eligible for state scholarships or financial aid, according to the lawsuit.

Angela Caddell, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said in a statement Tuesday that the Regents are in the process of determining how many students will be impacted.

“The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education will follow federal law,” she said. “State system institutions will determine their next steps in concert with their respective campus governing boards.”

Drummond, in his motion, sided with the Trump administration and requested that the court prevent the state statute from being enforced.

“Today marks the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers, who for many years have subsidized colleges and universities as they provide unlawful benefits to illegal immigrants in the form of in-state tuition,” Drummond said in a statement. “Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/trumpdojmarch142025_1-2048x1401.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 03:56:48.315106

SACRAMENTO – Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Department of Justice (DOJ) have acted as a first and last line of defense against an onslaught of illegal executive orders, baseless actions, and wholesale dismantling of our government and the rule of law. Today, Attorney General Bonta reported on DOJ’s progress in safeguarding California’s funding, protecting programs and services, and defending California’s values amid ongoing illegal attacks from the Trump Administration. In just over six months, Attorney General Bonta has filed 37 lawsuits, leading or co-leading 23 of them, and separately filed more than 40 amicus briefs in support of other litigation against the Trump Administration. In the 19 cases where he has sought and a district court has ruled on early relief, he’s succeeded in 17 of them, with 13 orders blocking President Trump’s illegal actions currently in effect. He’s also secured concessions and reversals outside of court, including the Department of Education’s recent decision to restore funding it had illegally frozen just days after California filed a lawsuit.

Attorney General Bonta has ensured that roughly $168 billion continued to flow to the state through a single early lawsuit challenging the President’s illegal and sweeping freeze of federal funding. He has also protected an estimated $11.1 billion in federal grant funding from successive targeted efforts by the Trump Administration to terminate, impound, or condition specific funding for education, healthcare, transportation, and more; defended constitutional rights like birthright citizenship and the right to vote; and stopped the dismantling of federal agencies like U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) and AmeriCorps, among other relief to the states. Looking ahead, Attorney General Bonta and CADOJ remain committed to holding the President and his administration accountable each and every time they break the law.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full-third of California’s budget – and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks. When the Administration’s first effort to freeze all federal funding to California failed, it changed course, flooding the zone with near-constant attempts to cut off funding like a dangerous and unruly game of wack-a-mole. But this is not a game. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods, their health, their education, and in some cases, even their lives. That’s why every time the President breaks the law, my office stands ready to take him to court,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. “For every dollar we’ve been given by the Governor and the Legislature in Special Session funding, we’ve returned more than $33,600 for the state. I’m proud of my incredible team who has been working around the clock to protect California’s people, values, and resources in the face of relentless attacks. We know that this work is just the beginning, but we are not backing down. Too much is at stake, whether it be school programs for our kids, research for our future, medical care for our sick, or infrastructure that keeps our cars driving and planes in the air. California will continue to fight at every turn to hold the President and his Administration accountable to the Constitution they swore to uphold.”

“California’s early, proactive, and defensive actions have helped California maintain its values in the face of wholesale attacks against our families and communities, while also serving as a backstop against tyrannical actions by President Trump and those who aim to ignore the rule of law,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “As the federal government continues to attack our state, California will keep defending itself, its values, and its people.”

WHAT WE’RE SAVING

1/3 of the State’s Budget: After the Office of Management and Budget issued a directive that purported to freeze nearly $3 trillion in federal funding, Attorney General Bonta led a multistate coalition in filing a lawsuit. He secured an immediate temporary restraining order and subsequent preliminary injunction, preserving roughly $168 billion in federal funding for California, representing about one-third of the State’s budget. These are tax dollars coming back into California, which contributes to the federal budget as a net-donor state.

Transportation Funding: California receives approximately $7 billion in grant funding from U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) each year to support and maintain the roads, highways, railways, airways, and bridges that connect our communities and carry our residents to their workplaces and their homes. In June, Attorney General Bonta secured a court order blocking the DOT from imposing unlawful immigration enforcement conditions on this grant funding.

Education Funding: Attorney General Bonta protected $939 million for California schools last week when the U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to withhold vital education funding just weeks before the school year was set to start in the face of a multistate lawsuit. This funding supports key programs for after school and summer learning, teacher preparation, and to support students learning English.

Public Health Funding: Attorney General Bonta also protected approximately $11 billion in critical public health funding nationwide, including roughly $972 million for California through litigation challenging and subsequent court orders blocking the abrupt termination of federal funding for grants that provide essential support for a wide range of urgent public health needs, including identifying, tracking, and addressing infectious diseases; ensuring access to immunizations; and modernizing critical public health infrastructure.

Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Funding: After the Trump Administration sought to withhold billions of dollars in funding approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Attorney General Bonta filed a lawsuit and secured a court order restoring more than $300 million in funding previously awarded to California.

WHAT’S AT STAKE

Stopping the Dismantling of the Federal Government: From his first days in office, President Trump has made clear his desire to eliminate many federal agencies and has sought to do so by dismantling the federal government from within. Attorney General Bonta has fought to halt these efforts, securing court orders restoring AmeriCorps programs and funding; blocking the mass firing and restructuring of HHS; and reversing the dismantling of several smaller agencies including the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

Defending Birthright Citizenship: In the Attorney General’s first case against the second Trump Administration, just one day after President Trump took office, he filed a lawsuit challenging the President’s unconstitutional executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. At stake are an estimated 24,500 children born in California each year that would be denied the citizenship they are entitled to under the U.S. Constitution. Attorney General Bonta, with a coalition of attorneys general from across the country, has won multiple court orders barring implementation of this order nationwide while litigation continues.

Safeguarding California’s Sensitive Private Data: Attorney General Bonta has filed multiple lawsuits to protect Californians’ personal and private data from misuse by the federal government. He secured a court order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Americans’ financial data; sued the Trump Administration for illegally sharing Medicaid data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s illegal demands that states turn over the sensitive and personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients.

OTHER WORK

Filing Amicus Briefs: Attorney General Bonta has filed more than 40 amicus briefs, including briefs defending law firms against President Trump’s retaliatory attacks; pushing back against the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal agencies; demanding ICE end unconstitutional immigration stops in Los Angeles; and standing up for our immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities.

Sharing Guidance: Attorney General Bonta issued guidance to law enforcement, prosecutors, public institutions, school officials, and more to assist them in complying with state laws like SB 54, which limits the use of state and local resources for immigration enforcement.

Issuing Consumer Alerts: Attorney General Bonta is committed to ensuring that Californians understand their rights and protections under state law in the face of the Trump Administration’s attacks. The Attorney General has issued a number of consumer alerts helping immigrants understand their rights and the public to avoid notario fraud and other scams, watch out for fake ICE officers, and understand tenant protections.

Providing Resources: Attorney General Bonta and a multistate coalition advised businesses and nonprofits of the ongoing viability and importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. A similar coalition issued separate guidance clarifying that despite the Trump Administration’s recent efforts to mislabel and undermine these critical efforts, public and private entities can still lawfully engage in environmental justice work.",https://oag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/og-link-card-24.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:08.448867

They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.
On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.
California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.","California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said Monday that his office has spent more than $5 million fighting the Trump administration in court over the last six months, but saved the state nearly $170 billion.

“That means that for every one dollar we’ve been given by the Legislature and the governor from special session funding to do this work — and we are very grateful for that funding — we’ve returned $33,600 for the state,” Bonta said during an afternoon news conference alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom. “Just to put it in perspective, if you told a Wall Street investor they’d get a $33,000 return on every one dollar invested, they would trip over themselves to get in on that deal.”

Bonta’s calculations are based on a mountain of litigation his office has filed against the administration since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, including 37 lawsuits — many alongside other liberal-led states — and 47 amicus briefs backing other litigants’ lawsuits against the administration.

The vast majority of the savings Bonta claimed were the result of one particular lawsuit, in which California and other states successfully challenged a Trump administration effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal funding to the states — including what Bonta said was $168 billion for California alone.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full third of California’s budget — and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks,” Bonta said.

Bonta also cited court orders his office has won protecting $7 billion in transportation funding to maintain roads, highways, bridges and other infrastructure; $939 million in education funding for after-school and summer learning and teacher preparation; $972 million in healthcare funding for identifying, tracking and addressing infectious diseases, ensuring immunizations and modernizing public health infrastructure; and $300 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. However, it has previously derided California’s efforts to block Trump’s agenda in the courts. Last month, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Times that Newsom was “destroying” the state and that Trump has been trying to “step in and save Californians from Gavin’s incompetence.”

The state Legislature during a special session in February allocated Bonta’s office an extra $25 million to staff up and fight Trump in court. As part of that allocation, the Legislature required that Bonta provide regular reports on how the money is spent. Bonta and Newsom’s news conference Monday followed the first of those reports being submitted to lawmakers.

Bonta said much of the $5 million his office has spent to date was used to pay for in-house attorneys and paralegals, and that none has been spent on outside counsel. He also said that, given the pace and scope of the work to date, his office will eventually need more funding.

“We’re grateful for the $25 million and the ability to draw down that $5 million so far. We do think we will need more going into the future, and I’m hopeful that through the conversations that we have — talking about what we would use it for, our success so far, what the continuing threats are down the road — that we’ll get to a place that will work for everybody,” Bonta said.

Newsom, citing Bonta’s financially consequential wins in court already, promised he’ll get the funding.

“Let me assure you, he will not be in need of resources to do his job,” Newsom said. “This report only highlights why I feel very confident in his ability to execute and to deliver results for the people of this state.”

Bonta’s report outlined 36 lawsuits his office had brought against the Trump administration through Wednesday. Those lawsuits challenged Trump’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, cut healthcare funding and research, dismantle the Department of Education and reduce education funding. They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.

On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.

Newsom said Bonta’s work to date shows exactly why it was necessary for him and other California leaders to call a special session and allocate the additional funds. California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.

“We were mindful that past is prologue,” Newsom said, and the added resources provided to Bonta’s office “have come to bear great fruit.”

Bonta said there is no time to slow down now as the Trump administration continues to violate the law, and that his team is ready to keep fighting.

“We know that this work is just the beginning,” he said, “but we are not backing down.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/694eafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2F07%2F0d007d784dd49f0a43cb49300e8d%2F1497898-me-bonta-office-behind-the-scenes-05-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:12.792252

Harris learned she was fired for a third time during her daughter’s high school graduation. It was a gut punch, she said, on what was meant to be a happy occasion.

The former chairwoman of an obscure but critical panel that mediates federal employee discipline, Ms. Harris was among an early slate of federal employees President Trump fired without cause. She sued the administration and went through four months of employment limbo before the Supreme Court ordered that she remain fired while her case wound through the legal system.

“Right now, I’m really laser-focused on getting my case to a win, however long it takes,” Ms. Harris said in a recent interview.

As she carves a path expected to lead back to the Supreme Court, she has added a new law firm to her team of lawyers. The four-lawyer firm, called the Washington Litigation Group, is the latest to join a coterie of pro bono organizations that have emerged in recent months to challenge the Trump administration, which is already facing about 375 lawsuits, according to The Times’s latest count.

The firm plans to focus on clients with cases likely headed to the appeals process with the potential to set precedents strengthening civil service protections and reining in executive power. Two of its lawyers, James I. Pearce and Mary Dohrmann, even share Ms. Harris’s experience of being fired by Mr. Trump. Mr. Pearce and Ms. Dohrmann were fired from the Justice Department in January because of their work on Jack Smith’s special counsel team investigating Mr. Trump.

The new group aims to bring appellate expertise to the very beginning of a client’s case, an approach that its founders say will improve the odds of making a successful argument before the Supreme Court.

It’s a game plan straight out of the Big Law playbook. But when many large firms receded from this type of work to avoid drawing Mr. Trump’s wrath, it created a void.

“Our purpose is to help fill that gap,” said Peter Keisler, one of eight members on the firm’s steering committee.

“We’ve just never before seen this kind of systematic effort by a government to use all possible levers of government power against perceived opponents,” said Mr. Keisler, a founder of the conservative Federalist Society and a former assistant attorney general and acting attorney general for President George W. Bush. The firm is applying for tax-exempt status and is seeking donations from foundation and donors. It has received some initial funding to cover the salaries of the four lawyers, a spokesman said.

The left-leaning group Democracy Forward, one of the biggest nonprofits fighting the Trump administration, has also recognized the gap in appellate expertise. The group is opening its own appellate shop this week, designed to mirror those at the big law firms, and has already hired more than a dozen lawyers, said Skye Perryman, the group’s president. The group is funded by foundations and donations.

The shift in pro bono representation is subtle but potentially significant in the legal challenges against Mr. Trump’s assertions of executive power, including the ability to carry out mass and targeted firings of civil servants and the elimination of federal programs authorized by Congress.

Now is a natural time to start thinking more about appeals, said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a professor at Stanford Law School, where he is a director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.

“Once the cases get up to the appellate level, that’s when people start to think about which one is going to have the right timing and package of arguments and facts that’s going to be well positioned” for a hearing before the Supreme Court, Mr. Fisher said.

The appeals-focused model was intriguing to Mr. Pearce, one of the firm’s four lawyers who was previously a longtime Justice Department prosecutor. Last year, Mr. Pearce presented the government’s argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against Mr. Trump’s claim that he was immune from charges of plotting to subvert the 2020 election. He was among more than a dozen Justice Department lawyers who worked on the two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump who were fired in January.

Mr. Pearce is disputing the firing at the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal employee discipline panel that Ms. Harris served on before her own termination.

“I think that a lot of the fighting will be on the scope and extent of a president’s Article II powers,” Mr. Pearce said, referring to powers outlined in the Constitution. “You see this in the independent board cases. You certainly see it, I think, in my firing and in the firing of other civil servants.”

Those powers are at the heart of the case pursued by Ms. Harris, who argues that the president did not have the authority to fire a member of a congressionally mandated independent board without cause. She said her challenge, as she waits for a decision from the federal appeals court in Washington, was not simply about getting her job back.

“It’s about much bigger principles of democracy and the balance of powers,” she said.

The Supreme Court's most recent term reshaped the legal landscape on immigration, transgender rights, and free speech. But behind the decisions, procedural shifts like limits on nationwide injunctions and expanded use of the emergency docket signal a court increasingly driven by politics.

At the ACLU we believe that information is power, and that informed opinions make a more perfect union. That’s why we’ve taken a hard look inside this Supreme Court term and analyzed what the court’s cases reveal about its values, and how its direction and influence impacts our civil liberties.

To help us all better understand the civil rights and civil liberties issues at hand this Supreme Court term, our series, “Your Questions Answered,” brings your questions directly to ACLU experts for informed answers. In this installment, our legal director, Cecillia Wang, answers your most pressing questions on the Supreme Court.

Some have said the Supreme Court is conservative. Is the Supreme Court affiliated with a political party or ideology?

The Founders designed the Supreme Court to be an independent judicial body, not a political one. Justices are not elected and don’t represent political parties. They are appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and hold lifetime appointments. This structure ensures that Supreme Court justices make decisions based solely on the Constitution and the law. But in practice, presidents typically nominate justices based on how their judicial opinions align with an administration’s political beliefs. The Senate confirmation process has also become increasingly partisan.

What is the emergency docket?

The emergency docket refers to cases that reach the court through a request to temporarily block a lower court’s decision from going into effect, or order relief the lower court denied, while litigation continues. It’s possible that more cases could end up on the emergency docket outside of the Supreme Court’s regular term.

The emergency docket was particularly fraught this term because of the large number of cases challenging the Trump administration’s actions. The Supreme Court sided more often with the Trump administration on emergency docket cases, allowing the government to move forward with actions the lower courts said were unlawful.

For example, the Supreme Court issued emergency orders in two of the ACLU’s cases challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to rationalize the detention and deportation of Venezuelan nationals without due process. In Trump v. J.G.G., the court granted the Trump administration’s request to pause a lower court order that blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The court ruled that the case should have been filed in the districts where our clients were detained, not in Washington, D.C. The ACLU then brought 10 new cases in district courts around the country.

The Supreme Court ruled on birthright citizenship. Did it eliminate this constitutional right?

No. The court only considered a technical — but important — question about when federal courts can block a law or policy nationwide, instead of for a particular person or group of people.

The Supreme Court ruled in June that federal judges should tailor injunctions, or blocks on a law, to reflect how the plaintiffs who brought the case are harmed. It disapproved of injunctions that block a law or policy nationwide without making that analysis. While it is clear that certain kinds of nationwide relief are still available under the court’s decision — including injunctions in nationwide “class actions” brought on behalf of groups of people — none of the existing birthright citizenship injunctions fit those molds. The Supreme Court ultimately did not answer the question of whether the existing injunctions were enough, leaving it to the lower courts to decide that.

This opened the door to the possibility that the government could partially enforce Trump’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship, putting thousands of U.S.-born children at risk of being denied their constitutional rights based on the citizenship status of their parents. The ACLU filed a new nationwide class-action case, Barbara v. Trump, seeking a nationwide injunction — so that even if the court orders were cut back, the unconstitutional executive order would not be applied to anyone born in the United States. We won that injunction in early July.

The government continues to try to argue that the executive order is lawful in various courts nationwide, including in its appeal of our first birthright citizenship case, which is being heard by the First Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1. The nationwide injunction in Barbara helps to ensure that babies are not wrongly stripped of their citizenship while the litigation continues.

Why is it important to fight for our rights before the Supreme Court – regardless of how the court rules?

The Supreme Court is the highest court in our nation. It’s charged with ensuring equal justice under the law, as well as upholding rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The court’s decisions shape how our rights are interpreted over the course of generations, and in some cases even centuries. That's why at the ACLU we believe any case we argue before the court has a direct impact on our rights.

For example, in U.S. v Skrmetti, the court ruled against protecting gender-affirming care for minors in Tennessee. Yet this loss still elevates how discriminatory efforts are impacting the trans community and why we must keep fighting to protect LGBTQ individuals in all states, including Tennessee.

A loss can still help lay the groundwork towards shaping a future that better reflects our civil rights and liberties. For example, In 1872, the court upheld a state law barring women from becoming lawyers in Bradwell v. Illinois. The court said that the “natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfit it for many of the occupations of civil life.” A century later, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged a different law that heightened scrutiny towards laws that discriminate based on gender. We’ve come a long way. At the ACLU, we recognize that the path to upholding our civil rights and civil liberties can sometimes be a long and complex one.

If the Supreme Court rules against our rights, what do we do?

The U.S. Supreme Court is not our only option to protect and expand civil liberties and civil rights. State supreme courts have the highest judicial authority in each state and make final decisions on state-based laws targeting constitutional issues. The ACLU launched the State Supreme Court Initiative to fight for the expansion of rights through state supreme courts. With lawyers in every state, the ACLU is dedicated to using state supreme courts to affect change at the state level to, ideally, influence federal or national policies.

The Supreme Court term is over, what happens now?

This term, the court served as an essential check on executive power at key moments. But in several high-profile cases, the justices issued rulings that favored the president. As a result, legal scholars and commentators have raised concerns about “the very real possibility that at least some of the justices . . . are worried about how much capital they have to expend in confrontations with President Trump.”

As the term concludes, attention now shifts to what lies ahead. The court may be in recess, but the constitutional stakes remain high. With the Trump administration continuing to press the boundaries of executive authority, fresh legal battles are all but certain. We expect the administration to continue to pursue its agenda through the emergency docket, forcing the court to act and limiting transparency into its procedures.The next term promises renewed challenges to the separation of powers, individual rights, and the rule of law.

The ACLU will be ready. Already we’ve filed challenges to expand and protect transgender rights, to end Trump’s assault on birthright citizenship and preserve free speech for all. Whether in federal courts or through public advocacy, we will stand at the front lines to defend civil rights and civil liberties from governmental overreach.",https://www.aclu-nm.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_og_image_1200x630/public/protest-in-front-of-scotus-s.jpg?itok=4xgE_g-e,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:20.811794

“I was being driven back to school and started talking with the cabdriver, and he said, ‘What do you do?’” the chief justice recalled at Georgetown’s law school in May. “I said, ‘I’m a history major at Harvard.’”

The cabdriver responded that he, too, had been a history major at Harvard.

The exchange was a turning point. “I decided — nothing against cabdrivers — that law school seemed like a reasonable alternative,” Chief Justice Roberts said.

The chief justice might have tried to leave history behind, but it has caught up with him. As the Supreme Court’s decisions increasingly turn on their understanding of the distant past, the number of supporting briefs from historians has exploded and their influence has grown.

Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in 2023 that such filings, which lawyers call amicus briefs, are “probably today the most important kinds of briefing,” considering “the composition of the court and the direction it’s been moving in and its jurisprudence.” She was referring to originalism, which seeks to determine the meaning of the Constitution when it was adopted.

Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, a prominent federal appeals court judge, was already marveling at the beginnings of the phenomenon in a 2009 law review article, noting that “honest-to-goodness historians, as opposed to lawyer historians,” had filed supporting briefs in major Supreme Court cases on the Second Amendment and efforts to combat terrorism.

“By my count (an admittedly rough count),” he wrote, “historians filed more amicus briefs in the last four years than they filed in the preceding seven decades combined.”

Since then, bona fide historians have filed scores of additional briefs, according to a recent study in The Journal of American Constitutional History. And those filings have been cited by the justices at a sharply higher rate than other sorts of supporting briefs, except for those filed by lawyers for the federal government.

“With the rise of history-based arguments at the Supreme Court, we’ve had a rise in briefs filed by actual historians,” said M. Henry Ishitani, who conducted the study. A recent graduate of Yale Law School, he is teaching legal history at the University of Tulsa College of Law while finishing his history dissertation at Yale.

But the intersection of two sets of domains — of history and law, of scholarship and advocacy — can pose challenges.

Richard H. Fallon Jr., a law professor at Harvard who died last month, wrote about them in a 2012 essay prompted by a request to sign a supporting brief on a historical question.

The brief was informative, Professor Fallon wrote, and “its argumentation fell well within the bounds of what lawyers could permissibly say in a brief.”

But he said no.

“The brief’s presentation of the historical evidence bearing on the original understanding was not nuanced or balanced,” he wrote. “A purportedly scholarly book or article that asserted its claims without further qualification would attract derision as one-sided if not misleading.”

“The Oxford Handbook of Legal History” devoted a chapter to an exploration of “why historians often find amicus brief writing so vexed.”

But one of its authors, Sam Erman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the rising influence of historians was heartening.

“Courts take these briefs by historians seriously,” he said. “For all the concern about how courts do bad history and never listen to the historians, actually they do listen to the historians to some degree.”

What they are hearing is a generally liberal message.

“Self-described historians have overwhelmingly chosen to file briefs where they can support progressive causes,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. Indeed, he found, 95 percent of the historians who signed supporting briefs making history-based arguments between 1987 and 2022 took liberal positions.

A far larger number of supporting briefs drawing on history were filed by lawyers and others who did not hold themselves out to be historians. Those briefs were more ideologically mixed.

What accounts for the difference? “Undoubtedly,” Mr. Ishitani wrote, “much of the discrepancy results simply from the demographics of a discipline that reportedly votes around 80 percent Democrat and 4 percent Republican, at least at the academic level.”

Another explanation runs deeper. “Leading originalists have long waged a methodological war with constitutional historians,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. One of those originalists, Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown, has objected to what he called “the priesthood of historians” who claim to have the exclusive ability to “tell us the meaning of our fundamental law.”

That stance, Mr. Ishitani wrote, “connects with the broader populist suspicion against experts that has taken hold in recent decades on the right.”

Professor Erman said the prominent role of history at the Supreme Court has had at least one positive side effect, one that might have steered Chief Justice Roberts in a different direction in his college years.

“In an age when there are declining history majors and a terrible history job market, this is an audience of powerful people that care,” he said, referring to the justices. “It’s created jobs.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/04dc-bar1-fgzl/04dc-bar1-fgzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:25.811392

Affordable housing in California zoning In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.","East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.

New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.

The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country.

Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.

The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.

Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.

The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute.

That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.

Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation.

Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.

The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.

Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.

The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.

“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.

A growingbodyofeconomicresearch has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.

Affordable housing in California zoning

In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule.

Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project.

The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval.

“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”

The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.

“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”

Tradeoffs in housing policy

If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.

Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue.

But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.

That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.

“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.

Confirming the arrest, Department of Homeland Secuity's (DHS) assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek via email on Monday that Othmane's ""B-2 tourist visa expired more than nine years ago. He will remain in custody at ICE's Eloy Detention Center pending his removal proceedings.""

Alrashid said her husband has since been subjected to ""inhumane treatment."" The DHS told California news station KABC in a statement that detainees recieve ""proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.""

Newsweek contacted the family via GoFundMe for comment on Monday.

Why It Matters

The administration is pushing forward with plans to carry out widespread deportations as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained. Newsweek has documented dozens of cases involving green card holders and applicants who were swept up in the ICE raids.

What To Know

Alrashid told the AP her husband has lived in the U.S. since 2015, and though he overstayed his initial visa, a deportation order against him was dismissed in 2020. They married in March 2025 and Othmane promptly filed for his green card, Alrashid said.

On learning her husband had been stopped, Alrashid got into her car and tracked his location on her phone, the AP reported. She reached the scene just in time to catch a glimpse of the outline of his head through the back window of a vehicle as it drove away, the agency said.

""Agents blocked his car, did not show a warrant and did not identify themselves,"" Othmane's family said in a GoFundMe set up to raise financial support.

The family said Othmane suffers from chronic pain and has an untreated tumor.

Othmane remains in federal custody at an immigration detention facility in Arizona.

""When they took him, he was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and flip-flops,"" Alrashid told a rally of fellow musicians, immigration advocates and activists outside the facility more than a week after his arrest.

""So he was freezing. Also, there are no beds, no pillows, no blankets, no soap, No toothbrushes and toothpaste. And when you're in a room with people, bathrooms open, there's no door. So it's very dehumanizing, it's undignifying, the food is not great either.""

What People Are Saying

Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Monday: ""Rami Jilani Othmane, an illegal alien from Tunisia, was arrested by CBP on July 13. His B-2 tourist visa expired more than nine years ago. He will remain in custody at ICE's Eloy Detention Center pending his removal proceedings.

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are committed to restoring integrity to the visa program and ensuring it is not abused to allow aliens a permanent one-way ticket to remain in the U.S.

""The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice—they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported. The United States taxpayer is generously offering free flights and a $1,000 to illegal aliens who self-deport using the CBP Home app. If they leave now, they preserve the potential opportunity to come back the legal, right way. The choice is theirs.""

Dr. Wafaa Alrashid wrote in a post on GoFundMe: ""This is not just an immigration issue—this is a human rights crisis happening in downtown Los Angeles. My husband has been subjected to 12 days of inhumane treatment in a federal building. He is not a criminal. He is a kind, peaceful man with an open immigration petition. He should be with his family, not sleeping on a concrete floor without medical care.""

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to KABC: ""Any allegations that detainees are not receiving medical care or conditions are ""inhumane"" are FALSE. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.""

What Happens Next

Othmane will remain in ICE custody, pending further removal proceedings.

A dozen Democrats in Congress sued the Trump administration last week for limiting their access to ICE detention centers. The lawmakers argue that the DHS, which oversees ICE, has inhibited lawmakers’ oversight responsibilities and violated federal law in denying members of Congress access to the facilities.

“ICE and DHS have repeatedly and illegally arrested and detained American citizens and lawful permanent residents without due process,” said Speaker Hakeem Jeffries in a statement. “These extreme tactics, like raiding churches and schools and unleashing masked ICE agents on law-abiding communities, are extreme and unacceptable.”

The cruelty we’ve seen over the past several months extends far beyond this country’s borders.

The U.S. is still on track to destroy over $13 million worth of contraceptives, paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars, and intended for women in poor nations—a move that itself will cost an additional $167,000. Trump officials have also turned down offers from multiple aid agencies to distribute the supplies at no cost. CNN reported that the contraceptives are predominantly long-lasting forms of birth control, including IUDs and injectables.

“They have to double incinerate the products because they contain high levels of hormones and they don’t want to risk leaking the byproducts out in the environment, which likely adds to the cost,” a congressional aide told CNN. “The Trump administration is quite literally burning taxpayer money.”

In our Summer issue, we unpack just how much the destruction of USAID and its vital programs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, reproductive health and more is impacting women and girls around the world.

, , and

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said at a town hall tonight that Democrats need to come up with an ""economic war plan"" to counter Trump's agenda and ""not just constantly play defense.""

The event in Benton Harbor — Slotkin's only town hall of the August congressional recess — was held before a supportive crowd of seniors and largely focused on Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts, the economy and the future of the Democratic Party.

Slotkin warned that she was likely to oppose a government funding bill in September unless the legislation restored health benefits cut under Trump’s sweeping domestic policy law known as the Big, Beautiful Bill.

In an interview after the town hall, Slotkin said she thinks Democratic leaders are too old and out of touch.

Voters ""want to see a new generation of leadership,"" she said, citing Zohran Mamdani's campaign as the Democratic nominee in the New York mayor's race.

""They don’t see themselves in, in elected leadership,"" Slotkin said of young voters. ""And that’s why some of the youngest members of elected leadership get a ton of energy and enthusiasm around them, because it’s like, oh, that person understands my issues.

Pam Bondi orders grand jury probe of Obama administration review of 2016 election

Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia’s actions during the 2016 election, a senior Trump administration official said.

The move comes after National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard claimed at a White House news conference last month that top Obama administration officials carried out a “treasonous conspiracy” against Trump. Gabbard said she was sending criminal referrals to the Justice Department.

A former senior Justice Department official condemned the move as “a dangerous political stunt.” And a former senior national security official pointed out that multiple past reviews, including ones conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes.

“There’s no logical, rational basis for this,” said the official, who asked not to be named.

Marjorie Taylor Greene urges Trump to commute George Santos' sentence

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on social media tonight that she had sent a letter to the Justice Department urging Trump to commute the sentence of disgraced former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y.

“I wholeheartedly believe in justice and the rule of the law, and I understand the gravity of such actions,” Greene wrote in a letter to the pardon attorney's office that she posted on X. “However, I believe a seven-year sentence for such campaign-related matters of an individual with no prior criminal record extends far beyond what is warranted.”

Asked in a Newsmax interview last week about a pardon, Trump said that Santos had ""lied like hell"" and that he was ""100% for Trump."" Trump said he had not been asked to pardon Santos.

Santos reported to prison last month to begin serving a seven-year sentence after he pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering that prosecutors said were part of a yearslong scheme.

Santos was first elected to Congress in 2022, flipping a House seat, and was expelled in late 2023.

Nebraska Republican discusses firing of BLS chief at town hall

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., tonight discussed Trump’s firing of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics just hours after the release of a jobs report that showed a slowdown in hiring.

Flood said he did not know the situation well and that “there’s always two sides to every story,” while noting he might have made a different decision than Trump.

“If all that person did was get the data out there, if all that, and I don’t know that’s the case, but if that’s all they did, I would not have fired her,” Flood said of now-former commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Some Republican senators reacted to McEntarfer's dismissal Friday by saying they would oppose Trump's actions if she had overseen the release of accurate figures. The White House is now searching for a replacement.

Reporting from Washington

White House officials began the week scrambling to find a permanent replacement after Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday, following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and drastic downward revisions of employment for the prior two months.

Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser in Trump’s first term who is influential with the MAGA wing of the GOP, is pushing hard for E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon’s podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.

In an interview with NBC News this afternoon, Antoni said he had not been contacted by anyone in the White House about the job. West Wing officials were “still running traps” on candidates for the Senate-confirmed position Monday, one White House aide said.

The White House did not return a request for comment on whether Antoni is under consideration.

Nebraska congressman asked about Epstein files at town hall

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he is in favor of releasing the Epstein files after being asked at a town hall about covering up their release.

“Let’s be very clear. At the next pro forma session of the Congress, you’ll find my name as a sponsor and a resolution from the House Rules Committee to release the Epstein files to protect the victims and not re-victimize them again,” Flood said.

Flood added that he supports Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the House Oversight Committee, issuing a subpoena to Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.

“I support Jamie Comer, who is the House’s Oversight Committee chairman, subpoenaing Ms. Maxwell later this month to come testify in Washington. I am for the release of those records,” Flood added.

Comer last week postponed Maxwell’s deposition until at least October to let the Supreme Court decide next month whether it will review her case. The deposition had been scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison, not on Capitol Hill.

GOP Rep. Mike Flood booed at town hall in Nebraska

and

Audience members attending a town hall for Republican Rep. Mike Flood in Lincoln, Nebraska, tonight began booing and jeering Flood shortly after the event started.

Flood kicked off the town hall by talking about Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” focusing on health care implications for Nebraskans. When he told the crowd there is a work requirement to receive health care, many attendees booed him.

The crowd also chanted “tax the rich,” which Flood addressed. He argued that a Democratic plan to raise taxes on the high-income households would hurt businesses and employment. His response did little to quell backlash from audience members.

The Nebraska Democratic Party encouraged people to attend tonight’s event with Flood, who is no stranger to contentious town halls. He was grilled in May over his support for the House version of the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Trump administration bars trans women athletes from ‘extraordinary ability’ visas

The Department of Homeland Security will update visa policies to prevent transgender women from traveling to the United States to participate in elite women’s sporting events.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued guidance today intended to bar trans women athletes from obtaining “extraordinary ability” visas to compete in female sports, the conservative news website The Daily Wire first reported. The guidance builds on an executive order Trump issued during the early weeks of his second presidency that was intended to bar trans women from competing in female sports.

The guidance doesn’t use the word “transgender” or refer to trans women; rather, it refers to “male athletes” who seek to compete in women’s sports.

Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement that the agency is “closing the loophole for foreign male athletes whose only chance at winning elite sports is to change their gender identity and leverage their biological advantages against women.”

India calls Trump's threat of new tariffs 'unjustified and unreasonable'

India responded to Trump’s announcement that he intends to raise tariffs on the country for purchasing oil from Russia, calling his move “unjustified and unreasonable.”

India’s External Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the United States and Europe have unjustly targeted the country for importing Russian oil, arguing that it did so only because traditional oil supplies were diverted to Europe after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The statement went on to blast Europe and the United States for continuing to trade with Russia.

“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the statement read.

Epstein victims blast Justice Department over lack of transparency

and

Two victims of Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, ripped the federal government for appearing to be more concerned with protecting the financier's wealthy friends instead of them.

The government is “asking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they have concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them, but them. I am beside myself,” said one victim, who sent a letter to the federal judge weighing the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury testimony in cases involving Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

The victim, who was not named, said, “I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or combatting child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way.”

“If there was justice for the victims we would see some kind of accountability for the years they allowed this horrible human being, if you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls,” the victim said.

In a separate filing, a second Epstein victim wrote in a letter to the court and the U.S. government: “I am not some pawn in your political warfare. ... Why not be completely transparent? Show us all the files with only the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allow me/us to heal.”

The person called for victims' attorneys to be allowed to review any redactions.

The victim also slammed the Justice Department's recent questioning of Maxwell, who's serving a 20-year prison sentence. The government, the victim wrote, ""did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/abuser for information.”

The Justice Department declined comment.

Trump ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of ""pertinent"" transcripts after a joint Justice Department/FBI memo released last month said that there was no evidence to charge other people and that no further information about the case would be released. The finding was met with furious backlash from Trump supporters, who had been assured there would be transparency in the case.

Some swing district Republicans object to Texas redistricting plan as Democrats threaten to retaliate

and

Reporting from Washington

Some Republicans representing competitive districts in blue states are speaking out against their party’s push to redraw congressional lines in Texas in an attempt give the GOP up to five more House seats.

Reps. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., have called to impose nationwide limits on partisan gerrymandering, a rare move for Republicans in Washington who have thwarted proposed bans for years.

Democratic governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and New York’s Kathy Hochul threaten to retaliate against Texas by pursuing their own redistricting plans that could knock out GOP-held swing districts, like those Lawler and Kiley represent.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott orders arrest of Democrats who left the state to stall GOP redistricting plans

and

Gov. Greg Abbott said today that he ordered the state's Department of Public Safety to arrest Texas House Democrats who left the state to stall GOP redistricting plans.

“Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans,” he said in a statement. He said he had directed state authorities to find, arrest and return the Democrats to the House chamber.

""This order will remain in effect until all missing Democrat House members are accounted for and brought to the Texas Capitol,"" he added.

The Texas House today voted to compel the sergeant-at-arms to “send for” the return of the lawmakers “under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”

Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu previously said about 57 Democrats had left the state. They have sought to disrupt efforts to redraw Texas' congressional lines.

Texas House convenes but doesn't have a quorum to vote on redistricting map

The Texas House gaveled in to begin debate on the new redistricting map but found it did not have the quorum required to continue legislative business.

House Speaker Dustin Burrows admonished the Democrats who fled the state as having “abandoned their post and turned their backs on the constituents they swore to represent.

“They’ve shirked their responsibilities under the direction and pressure of out-of-state politicians and activists who don’t know the first thing about what’s right for Texas,” he said. “Leaving the state does not stop this House from doing its work. It only delays it.""

The remaining lawmakers went through the motions, under House rules, of voting to compel the sergeant-at-arms to “send for” the absent lawmakers “under warrant of arrest, if necessary.” And Burrows gave lawmakers who did attend today's session permission to leave until tomorrow’s session.

Texas AG Ken Paxton says Democrats who fled the state should be 'arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law'

and

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement this afternoon that state Democratic legislators who fled the state overnight to block a GOP redistricting plan should face legal consequences.

Paxton, a U.S. Senate candidate, said the lawmakers ""fled the state in a cowardly desertion of their responsibilities as elected officials.""

""These jet-setting runaways abandoned Texas, abdicated their duties in the House, and sacrificed their constituents for a publicity stunt,” he said.

He continued: “I am prepared to do everything in my power to hold them accountable because these liberal lawmakers are not above the law. It’s imperative that they be swiftly arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law for turning their backs on the people of Texas.”

Redistricting clash escalates in Texas after Democrats scatter

+3

, , and

The Texas House is reconvening this afternoon amid a nationally watched clash over the GOP majority’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional lines, with dozens of Democrats fleeing the state to deprive Republicans of the ability to proceed with the plan.

The bulk of the 50-plus Democrats who left the state are in Illinois, where they’ve been welcomed by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker. Others are in Boston and in Albany, New York, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing for a change to state law to allow redistricting in response in future years. Back in Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is threatening to boot them from office or send law enforcement to force them to return to the state.

While the Texas House plans to consider the GOP plan Monday this afternoon, it cannot do so without a quorum — the presence of two-thirds of all state representatives. The rule means that 51 of the state’s 62 Democratic House members can, by remaining out of state, prevent the Republican-led House from moving forward with the legislation.

DLCC pushes for Democrats to pursue midcycle redistricting

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is calling on Democrats to use their state legislative power to pursue midcycle redistricting efforts.

The announcement, which focuses on trying to win state legislatures, marks a rise in the strategy in the broader party as Republicans in Texas push to redraw the state’s congressional map, which prompted some Democratic governors to pursue similar measures.

""As Republicans rig the maps in Texas, the DLCC is armed with our national strategy to win the larger redistricting battle,"" DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement.

""Looking at the state-by-state math, it is crystal clear Democrats must prioritize building and securing more state legislative majorities across the map if we want to go toe-to-toe with the GOP on redistricting now and in 2030,"" she added.

Jobs data revisions are common. Here’s how the process works.

Trump is adding gold to Oval Office ceiling

It’s not just the Rose Garden and the Lincoln bathroom: Trump is overseeing some upgrades to the Oval Office, too, including adding gold to the ceiling, a White House official said.

Trump has steadily added more gold flourishes to the office, which is undergoing annual maintenance, the official said. Scaffolding and tape were visible through the door to the office Friday. The updates are expected to take a week or two at the most, the official added.

Separately, the Rose Garden patio project is nearly complete, and Trump using the hardscaped area for events in the coming days. The White House also recently announced plans for a massive new ballroom.

Rep. Ro Khanna leads letter pushing for U.S. to recognize Palestinian statehood

and

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calf., is leading a letter calling on Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to recognize the Palestinian territories as an independent state.

The move comes after leaders in the United Kingdom, Canada and France said they would seek recognition of a Palestinian state. The letter has a number of co-signatories in the House, all Democrats.

“It has long been acknowledged by much of the international community and previous U.S. administrations of both major political parties that a Palestinian state recognized as a full and equal member of the community of nations is necessary to fulfill the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people and ensure the state of Israel’s survival as the democratic homeland of the Jewish people,” the letter reads.

In addition to Khanna, Reps. Greg Casar, Lloyd Dogget, Al Green and Veronica Escobar, all of Texas; Maxwell Frost, of Florida; Jared Huffman, of California; Pramila Jayapal, of Washington; James McGovern, of Massachusetts; Chellie Pingree, of Maine; Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin; Nydia Velázquez, of New York; and Bonnie Watson Coleman, of New Jersey, have signed the letter.

Despite the lawmakers' calls, there is little chance the administration will be compelled to take the step of recognizing an independent Palestinian state.

GOP congressman to introduce ban on mid-decade redistricting

and

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., announced that he plans to introduce legislation that would prohibit mid-decade redistricting nationwide.

If passed, the bill would nix new maps adopted by states before the 2030 census, but it’s unlikely that the House GOP leadership would bring the measure to the floor for a vote.

Kiley's move comes as Texas Republicans are attempting to redraw legislative maps in a way that is expected to benefit the GOP. Some Democratic governors have threatened to try to do the same in their states if Texas Republicans are successful.

In a statement, Kiley criticized the possibility of a new redistricting push in California. He said his bill would ""also stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.""

Hakeem Jeffries calls Texas Gov. Abbott a 'cowardly, fake bully'

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., denounced Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott for threatening to remove Democratic state lawmakers from office after they fled Texas in order to block Republicans from proceeding with a new congressional redistricting map.

""The Texas governor is a cowardly, fake bully. He was ordered by Donald Trump to convene a special session of the legislature in order to gerrymander the Texas congressional map and try to rig the midterm elections,"" Jeffries said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Ana Cabrera Reports.""

Jeffries said Democrats will respond “forcefully, aggressively and relentlessly” to the GOP effort to impose a new congressional map that could add as many as five Republican seats.

The minority leader said Republicans are trying to enact a map that would protect their hold on the majority in Congress by taking five seats currently held by Democrats, ""including several in majority-minority communities around Austin, Houston, and Dallas, breaks them apart and tries to put them into Republican hands.""

""We’re only three seats short from taking back the House,"" Jeffries said about next year's midterm elections. ""That is a historically close number. That is what has House Republicans and Donald Trump scared to death of what is going to happen in the midterm election. That’s why we’re seeing this extraordinary action in Texas.""

Asked if Democrats would respond to Abbott's threat to charge or arrest the Democratic state legislators who fled Texas yesterday, Jeffries said that would be immediately challenged in court.

In a separate interview on CNN, Jeffries also said Abbott is ""out of his mind"" and said that the Republican governor is making ""idle threats.""

The governor's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump again says he will 'substantially' raise tariff on India because it's purchasing Russian oil

Trump said in a post on Truth Social this morning that he plans to increase the tariff the U.S. imposes on Indian goods because of the country's purchase of Russian oil.

""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,"" Trump wrote.

""They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,"" the president said. ""Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!""

The president had already announced last week that imports from India would face a 25% tariff. He had also said at the time that there would be an additional penalty on India for its reliance on Russian oil and military equipment, though he didn't specify the amount.

Texas legislators might travel to other states, lawmaker suggests

Texas lawmakers in New York did not share many details about where they would travel next or how long some planned to stay.

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa said ""not all of us"" plan to stay in New York, and noted that her colleagues were continuing to talk with other governors

""We’re continuing to bring coalitions into the fold, and educating people as to what’s happening and letting them know that the rules have changed,” she said.

Hochul then chimed in, advising the Texas lawmakers not to say where they were traveling next.

Asked if the lawmakers would travel the country, not necessarily staying in New York, Plesa said, ""This is a war. We are building a coalition.""

Alongside Texas Democrats, Hochul says 'we are at war'

Hochul made multiple references to war during her press conference alongside Texas Democratic lawmakers, rhetoric apparently intended to emphasize the urgency of her response to the redistricting fight in Texas.

""Here in New York, we will not stand on the sidelines with the timid souls on the sidelines who don’t care, will not invest their heart and soul into this battle,"" Hochul said. ""This is a war. We are at war, and that’s why the gloves are off, and I say, bring it on.""

Later, the governor said that democracy was ""under siege.""

""For centuries we’ve stood up and fought,"" she added. ""Blood has been shed. This is our moment in 2025 to stand up for all that we hold dear and not let it be destroyed by a bunch of renegades in a place called Texas.""

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa also referred to ""war"" when asked about the lawmakers' travel plans.

""This is a war. We are building a coalition,"" she said without disclosing where they were heading next.

Hochul lays out timeline for redistricting in New York

Asked for details about how New York Democrats would try to change the state's congressional district map, Gov. Kathy Hochul said ""the only way that we can change the timing on redistricting is to literally amend the New York state Constitution.""

The first step would be for lawmakers to take a vote on such a measure this year or next, she said. The measure could potentially go on the ballot in 2027 and be enacted by the 2028 elections, she said.

No plans for Trump to use federal agents to arrest Texas Democrats in redistricting clash, admin says

According to an administration official, there are no plans to use federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers who have left the state to escape the jurisdiction of state troopers.

“Gov. Greg Abbott can handle his own state,” the official said. The White House has been unusually silent about the Texas redistricting drama since Trump was asked about it last month.

On July 15, Trump said he’d like to redraw lines in several states besides Texas.

“There's about four of them,” he said. “I'll let you figure that one out, but we have about four of them.”

Part of the reason for the relative silence on the issue lately is that Senate Democrats are now asking the Office of Special Counsel to investigate whether White House officials have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or on federal property.

NBC News reported last month that Trump held a call with Texas House Republicans where he talked up Abbott’s redistricting plans for the state, according to a GOP source on the call.

E.U. delays U.S. tariffs for 6 months as trade deal takes shape

The European Union said this morning that it would delay its planned tariffs on U.S. goods by six months as both sides implement their framework trade agreement.

The E.U.'s countermeasures were set to go into effect Thursday. The United States' 15% tariffs on European goods, meanwhile, are set to go into effect this week as part of the governments' agreement.

Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the United States' largest trade partner.

""This political agreement restores stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" the European Commission’s spokesperson for trade said. ""It secures continued access for E.U. exports to the U.S. market, preserves deeply integrated transatlantic value chains, effectively safeguards millions of jobs, and provides the basis for continued strategic cooperation between the E.U. and U.S.""

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she is looking to redraw legislative lines in response to Texas redistricting fight

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said this morning that she is exploring options to redraw state congressional lines ""as soon as possible"" as Texas lawmakers fled their home state in an attempt to stop GOP redistricting efforts there.

""We're already working on a legislative process, reviewing our legal strategies and will do everything in our power to stop this brazen assault,"" she said.

Hochul said the GOP push in Texas ""will have implications not just in Texas, but for our entire nation and its future."" She sat alongside Texas Democratic lawmakers, praising them for getting into ""good trouble.""

Hochul painted Texas Republicans as ""flagrantly breaking the rules"" in order to hold onto power. She accused them of trying to ""eliminate fairness in the system"" to avoid losing in future elections.

""History will judge us on how we respond to this moment,"" Hochul said, adding moments later, ""this is a war.""

""We are at war,"" she said.

American Eagle stock soars after Trump praises Sweeney ad

Shares of American Eagle jumped more than 12% this morning after Trump praised the apparel retailer's controversial ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney.

The president called it ""the HOTTEST ad out there,"" according to a Truth Social post. ""Go get ‘em, Sidney,"" he wrote of the ""Euphoria"" and ""Anyone But You"" actress. He also took a swipe at Taylor Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in November, saying he ""can’t stand"" the billionaire superstar.

The ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans"" ad campaign generated backlash for evoking the term ""great genes,"" which is associated with eugenics and white supremacy. American Eagle said the ad message ""is and always was about the jeans.""

Trump's post gave American Eagle's stock a reprieve from an otherwise poor stretch. It's down about 32% so far this year.

Ghislaine Maxwell quietly moved to low-security prison in Texas

Jeffrey Epstein’s convicted accomplice and former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas, a move that the family of late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre is objecting to as “preferential treatment.” It comes just days after Maxwell and her lawyer met with Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. The Bureau of Prisons has not specified why she was moved. NBC’s Hallie Jackson reports for ""TODAY.""

Stocks set to rebound after Friday jobs turmoil

U.S. stock markets are showing some life this morning after Friday's dramatic developments knocked them down a peg.

Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Industrials all pointed to a higher open. On Friday, stocks had their worst day since the spring after Trump released a new slate of global tariffs and fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after monthly jobs data showed far weaker growth than previously thought.

Wall Street will also hear from a big slate of major companies this week, as Disney, McDonald's, YUM! Brands and others are set to report financial results and weigh in on the state of the consumer.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP lawmakers visit Israel

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and several of his GOP colleagues are in Israel today and met with the country's defense minister, Israel Katz.

“I thanked them for their unwavering support and moral clarity in standing with Israel against its enemies, and for their vital voices in the efforts to bring all the hostages home and defeat the murderous terrorist organization Hamas,” Katz said in a post to X sharing photographs from their meeting.

Johnson had previously been scheduled to visit Israel and address the Knesset in June, but his trip was postponed after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, prompting retaliatory strikes.

New wave of Trump tariffs to take effect this week

As Trump’s tariffs are set to begin Thursday, rising prices from all the tariffs could cost the average American family $2,400 in 2025, according to a new estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.

Firebrand GOP Rep. Nancy Mace launches bid for South Carolina governor

and

Rep. Nancy Mace, who has at times broken with her own GOP leaders and often courted controversy, launched a long-expected bid for governor of South Carolina today, shaking up a crowded primary race that already includes big names in the Palmetto State.

“I didn’t come to join the club. I came to hold the line. They said stay quiet; I spoke up. They said sit down; I stood up. They said play nice; I fought back,” Mace will say in a speech in Charleston, where she made history 26 years ago as the first woman to graduate from the Citadel military college. “South Carolina is tired of politicians who smile for the cameras, lie to your face, then vanish when it’s time to lead. I’m not one of them.

Ex-football coach Derek Dooley launches GOP Senate bid in Georgia

Former college football coach and attorney Derek Dooley launched his bid this morning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Georgia, a prime pick-up opportunity for Republicans next year.

Georgia Republicans hope to win back the seat from Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is in his first term; it’s a major target for the party to maintain or expand its slim Senate majority. Democrats have overperformed in the traditionally red state in recent elections and hold both Senate seats. Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, while Donald Trump won by just over 2 points in 2024.

Reporting from Carol Stream, Illinois

A showdown over redistricting in Texas played out here yesterday as dozens of state Democrats took refuge roughly 1,000 miles away from home, saying they fled Texas to deny quorum to Republican efforts to add as many as five congressional seats to their map.

It culminated with Texas’ Republican governor threatening to expel the Democrats from the Texas state House and potentially extradite them, saying they may be “felons.”

(AP) — Federal and state officials in Florida must produce agreements showing which government agency or private contractor has legal authority to detain people or perform immigration officer roles at “Alligator Alcatraz,” the immigration detention facility in the Everglades, a federal judge said Monday.

Officials must provide by Thursday all written agreements and contracts showing who has legal custody of the hundreds of detainees at the facility that was hastily constructed more than a month ago on an isolated airstrip in South Florida's Everglades wilderness, said U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz, an appointee of President Donald Trump.

Ruiz's order was part of an ongoing civil rights lawsuit against the state and federal governments by immigration attorneys who say “Alligator Alcatraz” detainees' constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings.

The federal government and Florida had asked that any disclosures be limited to agreements between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and three Florida agencies — the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida National Guard and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

The detainees' attorneys had requested documents showing who was responsible for removal proceedings, as well as information on the number of employees at “Alligator Alcatraz,” but Ruiz said those requests from the detainees' lawyers were too broad.

The lawsuit is the second to challenge “Alligator Alcatraz.” Environmental groups have sued federal and state officials, asking that the project be halted because the process didn’t follow state and federal environmental laws. A hearing on that lawsuit is set for Wednesday.

Separately, the Archdiocese of Miami said it celebrated the first Mass at the detention center on Saturday following weeks of negotiations.

“I am pleased that our request to provide for the pastoral care of the detainees has been accommodated,” Archdiocese of Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski said Monday in a statement.

Citizenship by birth is more than a legal term—it's a life-defining right for children born on U.S. soil. But recent developments have left many parents deeply worried. If you're undocumented, on a temporary visa, or seeking asylum, you might wonder: will my child still be a U.S. citizen at birth?

In this article, we explain how birthright citizenship works, why it's under threat, and what courts are doing to protect it. We break down President Trump's Executive Order 14160, the wave of lawsuits it triggered, and how one class action—Barbara v. Trump—temporarily saved the day. By the end, you'll know what your rights are today and what risks may lie ahead.

Citizenship by Birth

Under the Fourteenth Amendment, anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, no matter their parents' immigration status:

""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens..."" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1

For over a century, this clause has been clear. The landmark Supreme Court decision United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) confirmed that a child born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents is still a citizen at birth. Courts have reaffirmed this ever since.

This principle, known as jus soli (right of the soil), protects children of undocumented immigrants, international students, and tourists alike. It guarantees equal treatment and a clear legal identity. However, this long-standing rule is now being challenged at the highest levels of government.

Executive Order 14160

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14160. His administration claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment had been ""misinterpreted."" The order seeks to deny citizenship to U.S.-born babies whose parents are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

Under this order, babies born to undocumented immigrants, temporary visa holders (like students or tourists), and asylum seekers would no longer qualify for automatic citizenship. Only children with at least one citizen or green card–holding parent would.

This change was to apply only to babies born on or after February 20, 2025. Older children wouldn't be affected. Still, the order created fear and confusion, especially since it bypassed Congress and attempted to change constitutional rights through executive action alone.

See another decision by Trump.

Federal Courts Step In

Almost immediately, lawsuits began flooding the courts. Plaintiffs argued that EO 14160 directly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Judges in multiple states issued injunctions to block the policy.

In Washington v. Trump, a federal judge called the executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional."" Similarly, in CASA Inc. v. Trump, Judge Deborah Boardman blocked enforcement nationwide. Both decisions reaffirmed that executive orders cannot undo constitutional guarantees.

Despite these victories, the legal fight was far from over. The Trump administration appealed. They challenged not only the content of the rulings but also the courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions in the first place.

The Supreme Court Changes the Rules: Trump v. CASA

On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. CASA. The Court said federal judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions unless a certified class of plaintiffs is involved.

This was a major shift. It meant that earlier rulings blocking the order across the U.S. were no longer valid for people who weren't officially part of the lawsuits. The justices didn't say whether the order itself was legal. Instead, they focused on how far a single judge's ruling can reach.

Still, the ruling gave hope. The Court said that class action lawsuits can still seek protection for larger groups. Plaintiffs quickly adapted, and a new legal strategy took shape.

The Case of Barbara v. Trump

Just two weeks later, the case of Barbara v. Trump changed everything. A federal judge certified a nationwide class of parents and children who would be affected by EO 14160. He issued a preliminary injunction blocking the executive order from being enforced against them.

Judge Joseph Laplante ruled that denying citizenship to U.S.-born children would cause ""irreparable harm."" Babies born here would be left without citizenship, rights, or protection—effectively stateless in their own birthplace.

Thanks to this class action, the order is currently frozen. All babies born in the U.S.—even to undocumented or non-permanent resident parents—are still receiving citizenship at birth.

What Parents Should Know

As of late July 2025, EO 14160 is not being enforced. Hospitals issue regular birth certificates. Federal agencies accept those documents as proof of citizenship. If your child is born in the U.S. today, they are a citizen.

However, this could change. The Department of Justice is appealing Judge Laplante's class-wide ruling. If higher courts reverse it, the order could take effect. That's why staying updated is essential.

At the moment, no child has lost their citizenship due to this policy. But immigrant families remain on edge. Many fear that the legal status of their newborns could shift overnight if court rulings change.

What's at Stake for Families and the Nation

If EO 14160 were to take effect, the consequences would be historic. Babies born on U.S. soil could be denied citizenship. They wouldn't qualify for Social Security numbers, passports, or basic legal protections. In extreme cases, they might even face deportation.

Beyond the personal impact, this order challenges America's identity. Birthright citizenship has been a symbol of inclusion, equality, and opportunity. Reversing it would send a message that some children—born in the exact same place as others—don't belong.

This legal battle is about more than paperwork. It's about who gets to be American from day one.

WOULD YOU LİKE TO LOOK AT TRUMP'S DEPORTATİON POLICIES?

Final Thoughts: The Future of Birthright Citizenship

Right now, the courts have paused EO 14160. But the final decision hasn't been made. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the order's constitutionality. That ruling could come in the months ahead.

Until then, birthright citizenship remains protected. But the road ahead is uncertain. The legal battle continues. And families must stay informed, alert, and ready.

What's clear is this: the meaning of being born in the United States is no longer just a matter of geography. It's a matter of law—and that law is being tested like never before.

Both Justices Sotomayor and Jackson refer to Robert H. Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence to emphasize its lasting impact on the judiciary’s relationship with determining and regulating executive authority.
From the way Justices Sotomayor and Jackson invoke Youngstown, it is clear they are sounding the jurisprudential alarm on the Court’s evolving interpretation of executive authority.
Though the Court claims the government will suffer irreparable harm, the real harm is happening to those subject to this executive order.
The question of the district court’s authority to enjoin the executive never came before the court in Youngstown; the Court only considered the merits.","Two cases from its recently concluded Term bring into stark relief the Supreme Court’s disrespect for both its own history and the authority of federal district courts to interpret and hold the executive accountable to the law. In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D. (2025) and Trump v. CASA (2025), the Court demonstrated enormous and troubling deference to the Trump administration in its efforts to unilaterally impose extreme and unprecedented immigration policies. In their dissents in these cases, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson made clear that the Court’s deference threatens to radically expand executive authority, weaken judicial independence, and curb fundamental constitutional rights to due process. In making their cases, both justices rely on Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), a nearly 75 year-old precedent that has long helped courts define the limits of executive power.

Youngstown is a 1952 case that arose when members of the United Steelworkers of America threatened a nationwide strike against steel manufacturers that would have disrupted steel production in the United States. President Harry S. Truman attempted to intervene to avoid the strike by directing the Secretary of State to take possession and “operate or arrange for the operation” of the nation’s steel mills to keep them open with Executive Order 10340. His rationale for the intervention was national security concerns regarding the United States’ efforts in the Korean War, to which the steel industry was vital in supplying materiel for the military. Truman relied solely on Article II’s executive powers in imposing the seizure, as no federal law could justify Truman’s actions, save an expansive reading of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which empowered the president to prevent strikes that affected national security but which was enacted over Truman’s veto. Truman, therefore, refused to invoke the Act as authority for the seizure, and Congress remained neutral, neither supporting Truman’s actions nor legislating against him.

Nearly all steel manufacturers sought relief in court to enjoin Truman’s order. Judge David Pine of the D.C. District Court ruled in favor of the steel manufacturers, in response to which the steelworkers initiated the nationwide strikes. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court decided en banc 5-4 to stay the district court’s decision, allowing the government to retain control of the mills and preventing the strike. The Supreme Court shortly thereafter accepted the petition and continued the stay. Twenty days after arguments were heard, the Court decided in a 6-3 opinion that President Truman’s executive order exceeded his authority under Article II and was therefore unconstitutional.

In his concurring opinion in Youngstown Justice Robert H. Jackson utilized both his experience dealing with executive power (Jackson had been appointed by Truman as Chief U.S. Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, 1945-1946) and his understanding of constitutional principles as an associate justice of the Supreme Court to conclude that “presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.” Justice Jackson outlined a metric for determining the constitutional boundaries of an executive action based on its legislative backing by Congress, ranging from a presidential act 1) with congressional authorization; 2) absent congressional approval or disapproval; and 3) in opposition to congressional will. Jackson writes that the President’s claim of authority is strongest under the first category, exists in a “zone of twilight” under the second category, and is at its weakest under the third category. Though Jackson’s was a concurring opinion, over the next decades, his analysis has become one of the most frequently cited in evaluating executive actions to determine their constitutionality.

Three quarters of a century after Youngstown, the Court is now rewriting the judiciary’s authority to review executive actions, authority that was quintessential in Youngstown. While the Supreme Court’s deference to executive authority has historically fluctuated as the nation faced various crises and conflicts, the Court’s recent obsequiousness has raised alarm bells for the liberal wing of the Court and Court observers.

In CASA, the Court proscribes lower court authority to restrain the executive branch’s actions in a decision that takes a formalist and procedural approach rather than addressing the underlying substantive issues, all the while disregarding landmark precedent. The Court’s majority opinion in CASA quashes district courts’ authority to issue universal injunctions against the federal government and opens the door for the executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to certain categories of non-citizen parents to go into effect in all states not actively litigating against the order. As Professor Kate Shaw of Penn Carey Law writes, “its going into effect anywhere would create both practical and legal chaos [emphasis in original].”

Though brought to the Court through the emergency or “shadow” docket as an application for a partial stay, the Court scheduled oral arguments. However, the Court failed to take the opportunity to hear the argument on its merits: the Trump administration is trying to assert that children born to undocumented or lawful, temporarily present mothers in the U.S. should be denied citizenship unless the father is a citizen or green card holder. Rather than considering this substantive issue, the Court took a procedural approach in an originalist manner. The majority concluded that Congress did not intend to include universal injunctions when it authorized federal courts to issue equitable remedies under the Judiciary Act of 1789 because, as the majority asserts, universal injunctions are not “remedies ‘traditionally accorded by courts of equity’ at our country’s inception.” Through this rationale, lower courts do not have universal injunction authority against the federal government. The Court then asserts the principle of “complete relief” in this case by detailing that “prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the child of an individual pregnant plaintiff will give that plaintiff complete relief: Her child will not be denied citizenship.” Essentially, if an injunction provides entitled relief to the plaintiffs in a case, a court may not issue a broader injunction to include individuals not party to the case. This is how the Court is asserting complete relief. However, this reading of “complete relief” fails to address the incomplete relief of the state plaintiffs who assert they will be harmed by the patchwork enforcement created without a universal injunction.

The larger issue, as the dissenters correctly and sharply point out, is the Court’s selective application of its own jurisprudence and complete unwillingness to engage with the actual argument on the merits. The majority’s rationale in CASA (along with its complete disregard of Youngstown) implicitly reinforced the same procedural-oriented decision-making process seen just four days earlier in DVD. In DVD—an emergency application brought by the government to stay a lower court’s injunction—the Court held in an unsigned order that the Department of Homeland Security could continue to process and issue third-country deportations without providing deportees with the chance to challenge the removal on the basis of possible inhumane treatment or other dangerous conditions. Though the majority did not provide an opinion explaining its rationale, the Court seemed focused on the procedural issues of the injunction rather than the substantive issues of individuals losing due process rights.

Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in DVD exposes this thought process, applying the due process analysis in Justice Robert H. Jackon’s concurrence in Youngstown to the present case: “The Due Process Clause represents ‘the principle that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that we submit ourselves to rulers only if under rules.’ Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 646 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).” The present Court overlooks this precedent; Justice Sotomayor correctly asserts that doing so erodes the fundamental value of due process that Youngstown laid out and signals the Court’s concerning choice to forego one of the most invaluable precedents on due process and executive authority.

Both Justices Sotomayor and Jackson refer to Robert H. Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence to emphasize its lasting impact on the judiciary’s relationship with determining and regulating executive authority. As Justice Jackson writes in her CASA dissent:

By duty and nature, federal courts say what the law is (if there is a genuine dispute), and require those who are subject to the law to conform their behavior to what the law requires. This is the essence of the rule of law. Do not take my word for it. Venerated figures in our Nation’s history have repeatedly emphasized that “[t]he essence of our free Government is ‘leave to live by no man’s leave, underneath the law’—to be governed by those impersonal forces which we call law.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 654 (1952) (R. Jackson, J., concurring).

Youngstown, then, is a core case that should have guided the Court’s decision-making in DVD and CASA, yet the Court offered no written explanation in the former and Youngstown is wholly absent from the majority opinion in the latter.

From the way Justices Sotomayor and Jackson invoke Youngstown, it is clear they are sounding the jurisprudential alarm on the Court’s evolving interpretation of executive authority. In fact, comparing the practical and legal circumstances of CASA and Youngstown reveals the majority’s divergence from precedent. Should Youngstown have been handled and decided the way the Court did with CASA, a legal desert would have opened across the country. If the Court had not addressed the substantive issue of due process rights at the earliest stage and rather allowed the Truman administration to continue enforcing its executive order until the merits were adjudicated at some later date, irreparable injury would have occurred. Plaintiffs would have lost control of the mills and suffered significant economic injury that would not necessarily have been fully resolved once the Court answered the substantive claim. In CASA, a class of people will be denied citizenship and removed from the country before the Court answers the substantive claim. Though the Court claims the government will suffer irreparable harm, the real harm is happening to those subject to this executive order. The question of the district court’s authority to enjoin the executive never came before the court in Youngstown; the Court only considered the merits. CASA’s logic would have concerned the justices of the Vinson Court, based on that court’s consensus that it was compelled to consider the merits of Truman’s executive order.

The Court’s decision to permit the federal government to continue its course of action in DVD and CASA, while considering only procedural questions and ignoring the substantive issues, veers sharply from its own precedent in Youngstown and that case’s progeny. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson are absolutely correct to raise the alarm on the Court’s disregard for procedural due process, lower courts’ authority, and the need to curb excessive exercises of executive power. If anything, Youngstown in the historical context shows us that even in a time of active military engagement where deference to the executive may be more appropriate and necessary, the Court refused to bow to executive overstep, trusted district court decision-making, and served as a necessary check to ensure due process is preserved as the merits are thoroughly considered and debated. The current Court is failing to acknowledge this core precedent. It is failing to play its proper role in checks and balances, thereby bolstering executive power at the expense of its own authority. And most heartbreakingly, it is failing to protect the most vulnerable among us.",https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-1345904494.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:50.066182

Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has promised to “flood the zone” with Ice agents in New York and other sanctuary cities.","For Orlando Gutierrez in Kansas City, the thought of cancelling his community’s summer Colombian Independence Day festival first surfaced “the week after the inauguration” in January, “when the raids started happening”. The decision was rooted in “trying to be safe”, Gutierrez said. “We’re not talking about folks that are irregular in terms of their immigration status. You only have to look a certain way and speak a certain language and then you’re in danger.”

For decades prior to 2025, the event had gone on interrupted – “in rain, in extreme heat” – and hosted thousands of Colombians and non-Colombians alike, Gutierrez said. “Our mission is to share our culture with people that don’t know it,” he added. “To not have the opportunity – that’s where it hurts the most.”

In Donald Trump’s second term as president, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has been historically expansionist: it now aims for an unprecedented 3,000 minimum arrests a day. Its agents have thrown undocumented people, residents with protected legal status, and even American citizens into a deportation system that increasingly does not respect due process.

Out of fear of being targeted indiscriminately, cultural and musical events from coast to coast – block parties and summer concerts in California; Mexican heritage celebrations in Chicago; soccer fan watch parties in Massachusetts – have been postponed or canceled altogether. Even religious gatherings are no longer perceived as safe from Ice. In San Bernardino, California, Bishop Alberto Rojas has dispensed his congregation from the obligation to attend mass out of fear of deportation raids.

Every decision to cancel is heartbreaking. In Philadelphia, Carnaval de Puebla, which was scheduled for April, made the call to cancel in February, said organizer Olga Rentería. “We believe this is not a time to celebrate,” Rentería explained, “but a time to remain united, informed, and strong.” In Los Angeles, organizers of Festival Chapín, a celebration of Guatemalan culture, have postponed the event from this August to October. “It was really hard to take that decision,” Walter Rosales, a restaurateur and one of the event’s organizers, told the Guardian. “We have a lot of attendees; more than 50,000 people every year. People have hotels, they have flights. We hire people to be there. But I think it was the best [choice.] The first thing we want is the security of the people.”

Rosales said he hopes that by waiting a few months, Festival Chapín can take place amid a different political climate, one in which Ice sticks to promises made by Trump to target primarily undocumented people with criminal records.

But mass raids are likely to get more frequent: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, legislation forced through Congress by Republicans and signed into law by Trump on the Fourth of July, will slash social programs while funding Ice at levels comparable to the budget of the US army.

It means that even huge stars are questioning whether concerts are safe for their fans. When the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced a recent tour that skips the continental US altogether, social media speculation centered on the notion that the artist did not want to put his fans in Ice’s crosshairs. That theorizing was in part fueled by Bad Bunny’s own dips into the wider political conversation: he’s called Ice agents “sons of bitches” on social media and his “NUEVAYoL” video – in which the Statue of Liberty is garlanded with the Puerto Rican flag – is a lovely and grand ode to New York’s immigrants.

Of avoiding the US on his upcoming tour, the artist himself has only said that, after touring regularly in the US in recent years, more dates at this time were “unnecessary”. (A representative for Bad Bunny did not respond to a request for comment.)

Gabriel Gonzales, the bandleader of the Los Angeles Latin music ensemble La Verdad, said some of their gigs have had to be cancelled this summer. “A lot of people are very scared to go out,” he said. “It’s kind of like the pandemic all over again.”

But as La Verdad continue to perform around Los Angeles and elsewhere, Gonzales is finding new meaning in playing live amid the Trump administration’s policies.

“It’s not like a rebellion,” he said. “It’s more like a resistance. As musicians, we are there to take people away for a few moments. I see communities pulling together and I feel like everything is going to be OK.”

For Joyas Mestizas, a Seattle-based Mexican folk dance youth group, which cancelled their annual festival this year, the plan is to be “more creative” going forward. “But we’re not going anywhere,” said the group’s co-director, Luna Garcia. “If I have to teach kids out of my basement, I’ll do it. The kids are going to dance.”

For some organizers of cultural events for Latino communities, pushing through and executing their plans despite fears of raids has become its own kind of crusade.

In July, federal agents were spotted on the premises of Chicago’s National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts & Culture just days before the institution was scheduled to hold its annual Barrio Arts Festival. The museum said the agents entered the property, “refused multiple requests to present a warrant, badge, or identification”, and “informed museum staff that they were assessing entry and exit points for upcoming events that may draw undocumented attendees”.

(In a statement, homeland security said agents “staged and held a quick briefing in the Museum’s parking lot in advance of an enforcement action related to a narcotics investigation”.)

In response to the presence of the federal agents, the museum decided not to cancel the festival – but, rather, to ensure it would go forward without endangering its attendees. Veronica Ocasio, the museum’s director of education and programming, said that in the days before Barrio Arts, she and her team “met non-stop” in order to create “as tight a security plan as we could”. The museum is located inside Chicago’s Humboldt Park; in order to cover the park’s 200 acres, Ocasio and her co-organizers assembled a group of volunteer immigration advocates who created a trigger warning and stood guard on rotation for the entirety of the two-day festival. If Ice agents were spotted, the museum was ready to shut down the event, close the gates, and bunker in place – holding attendees inside until the agents left. The plan then called for Ocasio and other museum employees to stand out front with immigration attorneys, holding the fort.

Delia Ramirez, an Illinois congresswoman, was also a key part of the museum’s plan. In order to head off potential Ice raids, Ramirez as well as other elected officials were on the premises “around the clock”, she said. “State representatives, city council folks, the mayor. All to protect constituents from homeland security.”

“The president has taken away people’s healthcare so he can hire more Ice agents to terrorize communities,” added Ramirez, but that doesn’t mean “there’s no oversight or accountability. At a time where the federal government wants to harm you, we will keep each other safe”. For Ramirez, Barrio Arts Festival was “a beautiful showing of people saying to Ice, ‘not here, not now, not ever’.”

Beyond her support for local cultural events, Ramirez is attempting to push back on Ice action more broadly: she’s a co-sponsor of the No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act which would prohibit Ice from the now-common practice of carrying out their deportation actions while masked. “People are freaking the hell out,” she said. “They don’t know whether it’s an Ice agent who is going to criminalize them with no due process or it’s someone who wants to rob them. No other law enforcement agency does this.”

Ultimately, not only did the Puerto Rican event in Chicago go on without interruption, but it was “our largest, most well attended Barrio Fest in our twenty-five year history”, Ocasio said. “We stood against intimidation and we created a blueprint for festivals in the city of Chicago.” The museum has already shared the safety plan it developed on the fly with organizers of upcoming events representing the local Colombian and Mexican communities.

Ahead of New York’s Colombia Independence Day festival – held in July in Corona, a working class neighborhood in Queens – organizers were similarly concerned about the possibility of Ice raids. They took precautions by bordering off the event, marking it as private, and creating a single entrance point where they would have stopped Ice agents operating without a warrant, organizers told the Guardian. Like Chicago’s Barrio Arts Festival, they had lawyers on hand from a local legal services organization. Ultimately, like Barrio Arts, they too set a new attendance record, with around 20,000 festival goers.

Catalina Cruz, a New York state assembly member who helped plan the Colombian festival, said that all the precautions she and her fellow organizers took “doesn’t explain why so many people came out – from all over the city and beyond”. She credited attendees with a certain kind of mental fortitude: “I’m not in their minds, but I don’t think they were giving a fuck about the president.”

Of course, that fuzzy feeling of having put on a successful mass event for the Latino community in the era of all-pervading fear of Ice isn’t a panacea. As Cruz put it: “What would have really stopped [Ice] if they wanted to get in? As we have seen in the case of California” – where federal agents have forcefully and en masse raided parks and working farms – “not a goddam thing.”

Newly flush with cash thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, Ice is now actively recruiting waves of new agents – to, in their words, “defend the homeland” – by offering $50,000 signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness. Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has promised to “flood the zone” with Ice agents in New York and other sanctuary cities.

But on that Sunday in Queens, the Colombian festival ticked along beautifully with no sight or sound of the federal government’s aggressive deportation machine. Vendors pushed street-cart ceviche and plastic pouches full of high-octane primary-color beverages: “Coctelitos, coctelitos!” Seemingly every other person wore the powerful yellow jersey of the Colombian national soccer team. Twentysomethings salsa’d next to older family members grooving in their wheelchairs.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52746d92947ee652793e4562ddff620a783f6f1e/100_0_3771_3016/master/3771.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4a5808cf3af3bd1ee7924c70ec8ec48",N,,2025-08-05 02:56:47.639910

It could make for a momentous September.

Here’s a look at what’s ahead when lawmakers return after the Labor Day holiday.

A bitter spending battle ahead

Lawmakers will use much of September to work on spending bills for the coming budget year, which begins Oct. 1. They likely will need to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks while they work on a longer-term measure that covers the full year.

It’s not unusual for leaders from both parties to blame the other party for a potential shutdown, but the rhetoric began extra early this year, signaling the threat of a stoppage is more serious than usual.

On Monday, Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries sent their Republican counterparts a sharply-worded letter calling for a meeting to discuss “the government funding deadline and the health care crisis you have visited upon the American people.”

They said it will take bipartisanship to avert a “painful, unnecessary shutdown.”

“Yet it is clear that the Trump Administration and many in your party are preparing to go it alone and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis,” said the letter sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Republicans have taken note of the warnings and are portraying the Democrats as itching for a shutdown they hope to blame on the GOP.

“It was disturbing to hear the Democrat leader threaten to shut down the government in his July 8 Dear Colleague letter,” Thune said on Saturday. “... I really hope that Democrats will not embrace that position but will continue to work with Republicans to fund the government.”

Different approaches from the House and Senate

So far, the House has approved two of the 12 annual spending bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed three on a strongly bipartisan basis. The House is pursuing steep, non-defense spending cuts. The Senate is rejecting many of those cuts. One side will have to give. And any final bill will need some Democratic support to generate the 60 votes necessary to get a spending measure to the finish line.

Some Democratic senators are also wanting assurances from Republicans that there won’t be more efforts in the coming weeks to claw back or cancel funding already approved by Congress.

“If Republicans want to make a deal, then let’s make a deal, but only if Republicans include an agreement they won’t take back that deal a few weeks later,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., a veteran member of the House Appropriations committee, said the Democratic minority in both chambers has suffered so many legislative losses this year, “that they are stuck between a rock and their voting base.” Democrats may want to demonstrate more resistance to Trump, but they would rue a shutdown, he warned.

“The reality would be, if the government were shut down, the administration, Donald Trump, would have the ability to decide where to spend and not spend,” Fleischmann said. “Schumer knows that, Jeffries knows that. We know that. I think it would be much more productive if we start talking about a short-term (continuing resolution.)”

Republicans angry about pace of nominations

Republicans are considering changes to Senate rules to get more of Trump’s nominees confirmed.

Thune said last week that during the same point in Joe Biden’s presidency, 49 of his 121 civilian nominees had been confirmed on an expedited basis through a voice vote or a unanimous consent request. Trump has had none of his civilian nominees confirmed on an expedited basis. Democrats have insisted on roll call votes for all of them, a lengthy process than can take days.

“I think they’re desperately in need of change,” Thune said of Senate rules for considering nominees. “I think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations, is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.”

Schumer said a rules change would be a “huge mistake,” especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.

The Senate held a rare weekend session as Republicans worked to get more of Trump’s nominees confirmed. Negotiations focused on advancing dozens of additional Trump nominees in exchange for some concessions on releasing some already approved spending.

At times, lawmakers spoke of progress on a potential deal. But it was clear that there would be no agreement when Trump attacked Schumer on social media Saturday evening and told Republicans to pack it up and go home.

“Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” Trump posted on Truth Social.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45e824c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5190x2725+0+368/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F00%2F512f7fd3b1b3a12fb15a28b3170c%2F5826bef126614b86b9007a4feabce401,N,,2025-08-05 02:56:51.799695

Weiser, a Democrat running for governor in 2026, joined other state attorneys general or governors on all of the cases. The decisions face appeals and are largely preliminary.

On July 24, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14322, titled, “Saving College Sports.” Much like the SCORE Act that the Buzz recently discussed, the EO attempts to set some guardrails around the “out-of-control, rudderless system” of college athletics. The EO maintains, “A national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deteriorating beyond repair and to protect non-revenue sports, including many women’s sports, that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics, drive American superiority at the Olympics and other international competitions, and catalyze hundreds of thousands of student-athletes to fuel American success in myriad ways.”

Of course, the president’s authority to unilaterally set such guardrails is limited, so the EO encourages universities, depending on the amount of athletic revenue, to ensure certain amounts of scholarship opportunities and roster spots in nonrevenue sports. The EO also states that “pay for play” agreements “should not be permitted” (emphasis added). To advance these policy positions, the EO directs certain federal agencies (including the U.S. Department of Education) to “develop a plan” using “all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms.” The EO also orders the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to “determine and implement the appropriate measures with respect to clarifying the status of collegiate athletes,” which is presumably that they are students and not employees. Of course, without a quorum, the Board’s ability to address this issue is currently limited.

DOL’s PAID Program Returns. The DOL’s Wage and Hour Division is reviving its Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program, which is intended to “help employers resolve potential minimum wage and overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as well as certain potential violations under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).” The idea is to allow employers to voluntarily correct payroll errors and make employees whole in a timely manner, all while avoiding litigation. Eligible employers must meet certain criteria—such as a lack of previous violations or current litigation—before being accepted into the program and beginning their self-audits. The PAID program was first implemented during President Trump’s first administration, but was abandoned during the Biden administration.

NLRB Acting GC Issues Guidance on Union Salts. William B. Cowen, the acting general counsel of the NLRB, has issued a memorandum to regional offices, providing guidance on how they should investigate cases involving union salts (professional union organizers who seek to obtain employment with the sole intention of organizing a workplace). While job applicants are protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), they may lose that protection if they are not genuinely interested in seeking to establish an employment relationship with the employer. The memo provides guidance as to how regions can determine whether a genuine interest in employment is present. Indications that an applicant is not genuinely seeking employment include, but are not limited to, mass or batch applications (or stale or incomplete applications); applications with fictitious employer names, suspicious email addresses, or offensive remarks; and the applicant’s “engage[ment] in disruptive, insulting, or antagonistic behavior during the application process.” (Emphasis in the original.)

Republican Immigration Bills Seek Jail Time for Executives; Elimination of H-1B Cap Exemption. Hoping to capitalize on the Trump administration’s immigration policy agenda, Republicans in Congress have recently introduced the following bills:

“Strengthening Accountability for Employers Hiring Individuals and Reforming Enforcement Act (SAFE HIRE) Act’’

Introduced by Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH), this bill would require executives of publicly traded companies to certify in their annual SEC filings the accuracy of their employment practices, including the number and legal work status of persons employed. Executives would also be required to report to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) known “significant deficiencies” that could adversely affect the company’s ability to ensure compliance with federal employment eligibility requirements.

Misrepresentations could lead to fines of up to $1 million, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.

Executives who knowingly hire unlawful immigrants could be fined up to $5 million and imprisoned for twenty years, or both.

“Colleges for the American People Act” (or “CAP Act”).

Introduced by Representatives Tom Tiffany (R-WI) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA), the bill would eliminate the H-1B visa cap exemption for institutions of higher learning.

The Buzz will be monitoring the progress of these bills, though congressional action on any bill relating to immigration will be challenging in this Congress.

State Department to Require In-Person Interviews for Visa Holders. The U.S. Department of State will no longer waive in-person interviews at U.S. consulates for workers on H-1B or L-1 visas, as well as students on F-1 visas. According to a July 25, 2025, update on the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs website, “All nonimmigrant visa applicants, including applicants under the age of 14 and over the age of 79, will generally require an in-person interview.” The change pulls back a Biden-era policy that had encouraged waivers of the in-person interview requirement.

This week’s UNIDOS Convention, which is hosted at the Kansas City Convention Center, Hispanic leaders fear worries over immigration raids and deportations may grow after last month’s passage of the Budget Reconciliation Bill, also known as the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

It’s a concern for some because of provisions it carries related to immigration. Recent raids in the Kansas City metro conducted by federal officers have convention leaders calling for unity and sweeping change.

“It’s a very scary time for a lot of families,” Carmen Feliciano, UNIDOS’s vice-president, said on Monday. “Our community is living in fear. They’re being prosecuted.”

Feliciano complains that immigration raids are being conducted in a heavy-handed fashion, and children are being separated from their families. Feliciano said fears are intensifying, amid concerns ICE raids may become more common after the passage of stronger immigration policies.

“What we’re seeing is they’re targeting our civilian community. They’re targeting Latino American citizens. It’s very alarming what we’re seeing,” Feliciano said.

At least two of those raids happened last week, as immigration officers swept two metro Mexican restaurants. At least 12 people were taken from the El Toro Loco locations in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. The Department of Homeland Security said it carried out a search warrant to rescue victims of human trafficking.

At Kansas City’s Mattie Rhodes Center, John Fierro works with dozens of Latino people every day at his non-profit on Kansas City’s west side.

“We just need to continue to be positive. We need to continue to use our voice, and stand up for those who are being targeted and apprehended for not legitimate reasons, and we just need to stay together,” Fierro said.

Crispin Rea, who represents Kansas City’s 4th District as a city councilmember, said these raids have a detrimental effect on children, who often witness their loved ones being taken away.

“We can’t control how the federal government makes folks feel, but at the very least, we can control how we make them feel and the extent to which they feel welcome here. That’s the goal,” Councilmember Rea told FOX4.

Feliciano said for the current generation of Latino Americans, this period of history resembles the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/08/UNIDOS-Convention-opens-in-Kansas-City.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:52.976805

In June 2025, Immigration Judge ShaSha Xu in New York City reportedly told lawyers in her courtroom: “We’re not really doing names publicly.” Only the government lawyers’ names were hidden – the immigrants’ attorneys had to give their names as usual. Xu cited privacy concerns, saying, “Things lately have changed.”

When one immigration lawyer objected that the court record would be incomplete without the government attorney’s name, Xu reportedly refused to provide it. In another case, New York immigration Judge James McCarthy in July referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney as merely “Department” throughout the hearing.

New York immigration Judge Shirley Lazare-Raphael told The Intercept that some ICE attorneys believe it is “dangerous to state their names publicly.” This follows a broader pattern of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests to hide their identities.

This secrecy violates a fundamental principle that has protected Americans for centuries: open courts. Here’s how those courts operate and why the principle governing them matters.

‘Presumption of openness’

The U.S. legal system is built on openness, with multiple layers of legal protection that guarantee public access to court proceedings.

This tradition of open courts developed as a direct rejection of secret judicial proceedings that had been used to abuse power in England. The notorious Star Chamber operated in secret from the 15th to 17th centuries, initially trying people “too powerful to be brought before ordinary common-law courts.”

But the Star Chamber eventually became a tool of oppression, using torture to obtain confessions and punishing jurors who ruled against the Crown. Parliament abolished it in 1641 after widespread abuses.

By the time American colonial courts were established, the reaction against the Star Chamber had already shaped English legal thinking toward openness. American courts adopted this principle of transparency from the beginning, rejecting the secretive proceedings that had enabled abuse.

Today, the term “star chamber” refers to any secret court proceeding that seems grossly unfair or is used to persecute individuals.

In the U.S., courts have repeatedly emphasized that “justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly.” The First Amendment gives the public a right to observe judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court has ruled that “a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice.”

Every federal appeals court has recognized that this constitutional right extends to civil cases too, with some exceptions such as protecting “the parties’ privacy, confidential business information, or trade secrets.” Federal court rules require that trials be “conducted in open court” and that witness testimony be “taken in open court unless otherwise provided.”

Many state constitutions also guarantee open courts – such as Oregon’s mandate that “no court shall be secret.”

While there’s no explicit law requiring attorneys to be publicly named, there’s also no policy allowing their names to be kept secret. The presumption is always toward openness.

In response to these recent developments, law professor Elissa Steglich said that she’d “never heard of someone in open court not being identified,” and that failing to identify an attorney could impair accountability “if there are unethical or professional concerns.”

Rules for anonymity

Courts sometimes allow anonymity, but only in specific circumstances.

Juries can be anonymous when there’s “substantial danger of harm or undue influence,” as legal expert Michael Crowell writes – like in high-profile organized crime cases or when defendants have tried to intimidate witnesses before. Even then, the lawyers still know the jurors’ names.

Similarly, parties to a lawsuit can sometimes use pseudonyms like “Jane Doe” when the case involves highly sensitive matters such as sexual abuse, or when there’s a real risk of physical retaliation.

But these rare exceptions require careful court review.

What’s happening with ICE attorneys is different. There’s no formal court ruling allowing it, no specific safety findings and no established legal process.

Immigration courts have fewer protections

Immigration courts operate differently from regular federal courts. They are so-called “administrative courts” that are part of the executive branch, not the judicial branch.

These courts decide claims involving an individual’s right to stay in the U.S., either when the government seeks to remove someone from the country for violating immigration law or when an individual seeks to stay in the country through the asylum process.

Immigration judges lack the lifetime job protections that regular federal judges have. As executive branch government employees, they can be hired and fired, just like other Department of Justice employees.

People in immigration court also have fewer procedural protections than criminal defendants.

They have no right to court-appointed counsel and must represent themselves unless they can afford to hire an attorney. The majority of immigrants appear without an attorney. Outcomes are better for those who can afford to hire counsel.

Immigration court records are also less accessible to the public than other federal court proceedings.

For years, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the nation’s highest immigration court, made less than 1% of its opinions publicly available. A federal court ruled that public disclosure was required; the Board of Immigration Appeals now posts its decisions online.

However, lower immigration court decisions are rarely made public.

Because immigration courts operate with less oversight than regular federal courts, public observation becomes more critical.

Open courts aren’t just about legal procedure – they’re about democracy itself. When the public can observe how justice is administered, it builds confidence that the system is fair.

Court watching protects transparency

Court watching has become an important way for citizens to ensure due process is honored, especially in immigration cases.

Observers can monitor whether proper legal procedures are being followed. They can watch for signs that attorneys are prepared, treating people respectfully and following court rules – regardless of whether those attorneys identify themselves.

Observers help track trends such as lack of legal representation, language barriers or procedural unfairness that can inform advocacy for reforms. This kind of public oversight is especially important in immigration court, where people often don’t have lawyers and may not understand their rights.

When community members bear witness to these proceedings, it helps ensure the system operates fairly and transparently.

Professional ethics and accountability

As a law professor who runs a law school’s Center for Professional Ethics, I can say that while there’s no specific law forcing ICE attorneys to identify themselves, they are still bound by rules of professional conduct that require accountability and transparency.

State bar associations have clear standards about attorney conduct in court proceedings. The American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct emphasize that lawyers are “officers of the legal system” with duties to uphold its integrity.

Immigration judges, despite being government employees rather than lifetime-tenured federal judges, are also bound by judicial conduct codes that require them to uphold public confidence in the justice system. When judges allow or encourage anonymity without formal procedures or safety findings, they risk violating these ethical obligations.

Bar associations can investigate professional conduct violations and impose sanctions ranging from reprimands to suspension or disbarment. While enforcement against federal government lawyers has historically been uncommon, sustained documentation by court observers can provide the evidence needed for formal complaints.

While government attorneys, judges and other court personnel may face real safety concerns, hiding their identities in open court is unprecedented and breaks with centuries of legal tradition that requires accountability and transparency in our justice system.

As pressure mounts to process immigration cases quickly, courts are ethically and legally bound to ensure that speed doesn’t come at the expense of fundamental fairness and transparency.

The Justice Department is trying to distance itself from Miller and his expectations for federal agents to arrest 3,000 undocumented immigrants per day. In the midst of a lawsuit over ICE’s illegal sweeps in Los Angeles, the department informed federal judges that no such official quota existed.

“DHS has confirmed that neither ICE leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that ICE or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law,” a Justice Department attorney reported to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

DOJ attorney Yaakov Roth attributed the number to “anonymous reports in the newspapers,” but that’s not true. Miller was recorded stating the goal in May, when he told Fox News unequivocally that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every day.”

The discrepancy between what White House advisers are willing to say on live air versus in court could boil down to a growing “gulf” that “may be undermining the DOJ’s already strained credibility with judges,” reported Politico. Skeptical judges have pointed to the figure as grounds to question whether the Trump administration’s immigration objectives are even legal.

Yet a Justice Department spokesperson insisted to the publication that there was no divergence between the White House and the law enforcement agency regarding its immigration stats and orders.

“The entire Trump Administration is united in fully enforcing our nation’s immigration laws and the DOJ continues to play an important role in vigorously defending the President’s deportation agenda in court,” a DOJ spokesperson told Politico.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott is threatening to expel any Democratic legislators who don’t show up to the Texas Capitol by Monday afternoon—after Democrats fled the state to stop a vote on Republicans’ obviously gerrymandered congressional maps.

Fifty-one Texas Democrats left the Lone Star State over the weekend, thus denying Republicans the two-thirds quorum needed for votes in the state’s 150-member legislature. They plan to stay away for the duration of the two-week special legislation in which the House is scheduled to vote on the GOP’s new congressional maps.

“We’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent,” said state Representative Gene Wu, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus. “As of today, this corrupt special session is over.”

In a statement Sunday, Abbott fulminated against the Democrats. “This truancy ends now,” he wrote. “The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025.”

Citing a 2021 opinion by Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton—who, during this ongoing gerrymandering saga, has called Democrats “cowards” who ought to be “hunt[ed] down”—Abbott said he may treat quorum-breakers as having forfeited their offices, in which case they, purportedly, could be removed from office and “swiftly” replaced.

He also accused the Democratic lawmakers of possible felonies for receiving donations to offset daily $500 fines for their absence.

The Paxton opinion, however, does not say that lawmakers who break quorum can be removed, but rather that “this is a fact-specific question only resolvable by a court,” noted Politico’s Kyle Cheney. It also refrained from deciding on the constitutionality of breaking a quorum.

Texas Democrats replied to Abbott with a storied Texas battle cry, issuing a four-word statement: “Come and take it.”

The president’s boasts about his pharmaceutical cuts aren’t just imaginary—they’re also gibberish.

Speaking with reporters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Sunday evening, Donald Trump suggested that one of the administrative wins that Republican lawmakers should hinge their campaigns on during midterm elections is the “tremendous drop in drug prices.”

“You know we’ve cut drug prices by 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 percent,” Trump said. “Because we’re going favored nations, we want the same price as Europe gets, we want the same price as other country gets.”

If Trump’s boast were true, drug companies would actually be paying consumers to take prescription drugs.

“Over the years, 25-30 years ago, it started where they were charging us much more and I put an end to it with a letter that you saw last week,” Trump said.

But the president has not tangibly lowered drug costs. Instead, his office issued letters Thursday to pharmaceutical companies, plainly asking them to lower their prices while vaguely threatening to deploy “every tool in our arsenal” to combat “abusive” prices should they refuse.

Trump has previously posited that the affordable price tags on pharmaceuticals in other countries were due to American federal subsidies that he claimed were financially offsetting their prices. But that’s not reality: The U.S. pays more for drugs because it’s an outlier among high-income, developed countries, which predominantly support universal public health coverage.

Trump’s first-term rule—“Most Favored Nation”—was focused on lowering the cost of Medicare payments on certain drugs, but the plan barely made it out of the White House. The policy was blocked by federal courts shortly after it was announced in late 2020 and was then rescinded by President Joe Biden in 2021.

In May, Trump penned an executive order that set a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to negotiate lower prices. If there was no deal, the U.S. would tie its drug prices to the costs set by other countries. But despite that threat, there hasn’t been any noticeable movement in either direction.

“I don’t know how anybody could win an election if they’re on the other side of that issue,” Trump said Sunday. “So we’ll be dropping drug prices, it will start over the next two to three months.

“But not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot, because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug, and we’re going to be paying the same thing,” Trump said, promising that Americans would pay the same price for drugs as the company’s lowest international cost.

Other things that researchers point to as potentially resolving high drug prices in the U.S. include restricting pharmaceutical monopolies within the country, reworking insurance benefits to restrict out-of-pocket, and recentralizing price negotiations through the leverage of a single-payer system (such as Australia, Germany, the U.K., or any number of other wealthy nations), according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, a private American foundation focused on health care reform.

As Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to bolster its ranks by 10,000—courtesy of the slush fund it is provided under Trump’s budget—it’s resorted to poaching local law enforcement officers who participated in ICE’s 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to partner with the agency.

In recent days, ICE’s deputy director has reportedly sent out emails urging 287(g) participants to join the agency. “As someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law,” the email says, per NBC News. The offer also carries potential incentives, including a $50,000 signing bonus and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association, told NBC the move was “inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,” adding, “We’re all on the same boat. And you just don’t treat friends or partners like this.”

Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida, told MSNBC, “We’re a force multiplier to help ICE, and we’ve been spending a lot of time and effort. And the next thing we know, the people who we have submitted to ICE, who have been ICE-trained—on our dime, by the way—received a direct email from the administration.”

Judd reached for an idiom to convey the betrayal: “I mean, that’s biting the hand that’s feeding you.” Other Florida sheriffs also got figurative: “Quite frankly, it’s like letting the fox in the henhouse,” Brevard County’s sheriff told WFTV Channel 9. “We don’t want to burn bridges, but somebody lit the fire on the other end,” observed the sheriff of Bradford County.

A number of sheriffs are now demanding mea culpas from ICE. (Judd, for instance, told NBC that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should “get on her big girl pants and do what’s right. She needs to make sure that there’s an apology.”) Some are apparently receiving them: The sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, reportedly received an apology from ICE’s Atlanta Field Office.

Just hours before Donald Trump announced he was firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Vice President JD Vance was celebrating some cherry-picked numbers from the latest jobs report.

In a post on X Friday, Vance shared a graph based on the most recent BLS data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, claiming that in the last four months, native-born workers had gained a whopping 1.8 million jobs while foreign-born workers had lost 1.5 million jobs. The number of foreign-born workers included both documented and undocumented workers.

“I was told 6 months ago that Americans losing jobs and the foreign-born gaining jobs was an irreversible demographic fact,” Vance wrote. “Turns out you just needed a new president and a new immigration policy.”

As per usual, Vance was a little behind the curve.

Within hours, Trump had directed his administration to fire BLS Commissioner Dr. Erika McEntarfer, a Biden-appointee. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social, torching the very numbers Vance had been toasting him over.

The latest jobs report revised the number of new jobs created by 258,000 in just two months—a revision on par with those that Trump had railed the Biden administration over ahead of the presidential election. It’s honestly amazing that Vance was able to find anything to celebrate in the dismal report, which saw only 73,000 jobs created in July, trailing estimates by more than 30,000.

Trump on Friday proved that fears about the president manipulating official data in his favor are founded, as he fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, due to a disappointing July jobs report.

The bureau’s report, released earlier in the day, showed a marked slowdown in job growth. It also revised previous months’ gains downward, shaving nearly 260,000 jobs off May’s and June’s report. Reacting to the news, Trump adviser Steve Bannon suggested appointing “a MAGA Republican that President Trump knows and trusts” to head the BLS.

Shortly thereafter, Trump announced his plan to do just that.

“I was just informed that our Country’s ‘Jobs Numbers’ are being produced by a Biden Appointee,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday afternoon. He baselessly accused McEntarfer of having fabricated job numbers, both in July and in the lead-up to the 2024 election—when, he claims, McEntarfer attempted to help rig the election for Kamala Harris.

“I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” The president dubiously insisted that “the Economy is BOOMING under ‘TRUMP.’”

The move is a remarkable one, as Trump has all but confessed to a plan to ensure that official data (whose integrity has already been imperiled by his cuts to federal statistical agencies) suits MAGA’s narrative.

Steve Benen of MSNBC last month observed that some were worried Trump would cook the books by, for example, telling “the Labor Department to manipulate the data and deceive the public.” However, Benen noted, “there’s been no evidence of statistics being altered to fit a political narrative” to date.

If Trump appoints a MAGA lackey to head the BLS, he wouldn’t have to tell anyone to do anything; the new commissioner would know that the bureau’s numbers are to reflect favorably on the administration no matter what.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will be shutting down in response to federal funding cuts, it announced on Friday.

The closure marks a victory in Donald Trump’s war against public media. The CPB’s announcement cites the federal recissions package, which clawed back $1.1 billion in previously approved funding for the organization, and its exclusion from a fiscal spending bill for the first time in over five decades.

“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison.

The company, which helps support more than 1,500 locally managed public television and radio stations nationwide, including NPR and PBS, will begin an “orderly wind-down” of its operations, including the termination of the majority of its employees by September 30.

Organizations like NPR and PBS have been the targets of Republican ire for years over alleged liberal bias. The national organizations will survive the CPB’s announcement, since they receive most of their funding through nongovernmental sources. But small, local news stations that serve rural areas will be seriously affected by these closures.

Some stations, like KCUW in Pendleton, Oregon; KUHB in St. Paul, Alaska; and WVLS in Monterey, Virginia; rely on CPB for 90 percent of their funding, according to Axios.

“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said in the announcement. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”

Editor’s Pick:

Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to a minimum-security prison amid speculations that Donald Trump might pressure the Epstein co-conspirator to clear his name.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Maxwell had been moved to the Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a women-only, minimum-security prison in Bryan, Texas. She had previously been held at FCI Tallashassee, a low-security facility in Florida.

Just 24 hours earlier, a Trump administration official told CNN that the government had no such plans to go easy on Maxwell. “No leniency is being given or discussed. That’s just false,” the official said. “The president himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time.”

Maxwell’s sudden move arrives amid swirling rumors that the president may try to offer her a presidential pardon in exchange for helping him disperse the heightened scrutiny over his numerous mentions in the Epstein files, which the government had coincidentally decided not to release.

The family of Virginia Giuffre, the former Trump employee who claimed she was recruited by Maxwell at 16 to travel with the convicted sex offender, previously warned against giving Maxwell leniency and blasted Maxwell’s favorable treatment in a Friday statement.

It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas. This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar. This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.

Earlier this week, the president claimed that Epstein “stole” Giuffre, sparking widespread outrage and inviting even more questions about whether he had been aware of his old friend’s alleged sex trafficking.

On the economy, a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign, multiple polls show that voters decisively disapprove of Trump’s approach, especially when it comes to trade policy.
The administration’s handling of the Jeffery Epstein issue also appears to be weighing on Trump’s numbers, even among his base.
Slightly more than one-fifth (22 percent) of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, a number that would look considerably worse if not for Trump’s own base.
Yet so far, Democrats have been unable to capitalize on Trump’s negative approval ratings.","As President Trump expands the trade war with new tariffs against more than 60 countries, it would behoove his administration to pay attention to what polls and public sentiment are saying.

Indeed, with Republicans holding an extremely narrow lead in the House of Representatives, how Americans feel about the administration figures to play a critical role, as midterms tend to be referenda on the party in charge.

To that end, polls continue to reflect Trump’s divisiveness and the polarization evident in American politics today, as well as widespread discontent over tariffs.

Indeed, the RealClearPolitics polling aggregator shows Trump’s average approval rating 5 points underwater — with 46 percent approval versus 51 percent disapproval.

Trump’s approval rating represents an almost 4-point drop from the roughly 50 percent of the popular vote that he won in the 2024 election.

That said, the administration should be concerned about sentiment among independents. Just 3 in 10 (29 percent) of this critical voting bloc give Trump a positive approval rating, whereas a strong majority (62 percent) disapprove of the president thus far.

Trump’s second term polling has been surprisingly stable compared to his first. Trump’s ratings, per RealClearPolitics, have never surpassed the plus-6 points he entered office with, nor have they exceeded minus-7. The relative range-bound numbers underscore that Trump has both a firm floor on his numbers and a hard ceiling.

With that in mind, the data on how Americans feel about Trump’s handling of specific issues have been much more volatile, suggesting underlying pessimism about the president and his policies.

On the economy, a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign, multiple polls show that voters decisively disapprove of Trump’s approach, especially when it comes to trade policy.

Recent polling from Fox News reveals that a majority (55 percent) of registered voters disapprove of his economic approach, whereas 44 percent approve.

Emerson University polling confirms Fox’s findings, showing a 10-point net disapproval (51 percent to 41 percent).

Recent Morning Consult polling shows that 6 in 10 (61 percent) Americans blame Trump personally for driving up the cost of living due to tariffs. A similar share (63 percent) also believe tariffs have had a negative impact on grocery prices.

Those polls come on the heels of the passage of the “Big, Beautiful bill,” which, as we’ve previously noted in these pages, was viewed quite negatively, and just before an expanded tariff policy.

Immediately prior to Trump’s tax and spending bill, a Fox News poll found that a strong majority (59 percent) of voters opposed the bill, versus just 38 percent who supported it.

Negative sentiment towards Trump’s handling of the economy had begun to improve from April’s tariff-induced chaos, particularly as trade deals were signed and it appeared more were on the way.

However, Trump had backtracked, with a series of on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs before ultimately implementing broad tariffs covering more than 60 countries on Thursday.

It is likely that Trump expanded the trade war at exactly the wrong time.

Inflation has also begun creeping back up, with the personal consumption expenditures index rising for the second straight month to the highest level since February, just as hiring is slowing markedly, according to Friday’s jobs report.

That is bad news for a president who, in addition to the aforementioned Morning Consult data, has a net negative 22-point rating on handling inflation (37 percent approve, 59 percent disapprove) according to Economist/YouGov polling.

Even on immigration, which had been a strength for the president, Trump’s heavy-handed approach has rankled voters.

A Quinnipiac poll from mid-July shows that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of how the White House is handling immigration, while 40 percent approve.

And while Quinnipiac’s numbers are more negative than other polls, RealClearPolitics’ tracker still shows Trump with a net negative 7-point rating on immigration.

The administration’s handling of the Jeffery Epstein issue also appears to be weighing on Trump’s numbers, even among his base.

Slightly more than one-fifth (22 percent) of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, a number that would look considerably worse if not for Trump’s own base. However, even among Trump voters, less than a majority (45 percent) give the president a passing grade on Epstein, per Economist/YouGov polling.

With help from Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.), who sent the House home for recess earlier than anticipated, Trump was able to avoid congressional pressure on Epstein. But that reprieve will end in a few weeks, and the issue will likely be brought back into the spotlight.

To be sure, polling does also reveal a handful of bright spots for the administration.

The share of Americans believing the country is on the “wrong track” (54 percent) remains far below the 75 percent peak that occurred during former President Biden’s term.

Yet so far, Democrats have been unable to capitalize on Trump’s negative approval ratings.

Democrats’ lead in the generic congressional ballot (3 points) is solidly within the margin of error, while some individual polls such as one from Cygnal show just a 1-point lead, a virtual tie.

In that same vein, whereas Wall Street Journal polling shows that a slight majority (52 percent) of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, that is still far below the nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of voters who view the Democratic Party unfavorably.

Moreover, while Americans give Trump negative marks on the economy, inflation, tariffs and foreign policy, they still trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle each issue, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis.

As they note, “disapproval of Trump’s handling of inflation outweighs approval by 11 points, and yet the GOP is trusted more than Democrats to handle inflation by 10 points.”

That is a remarkable contrast, and underscores that, despite elevated levels of disapproval toward Trump, Democrats remain unable to provide a viable alternative.

The ultimate impact of public opinion towards Trump on the midterms remains to be seen, but thus far, the data indicates that while Trump’s grip on his base remains intact, he is losing support among swing voters and even some non-MAGA Republicans.

Whether or not he can reverse this trend ahead of midterms will be critical, but only if Democrats find a way to capitalize on growing disillusionment toward Trump and the Republicans.

Foreigners seeking to enter the United States on tourist or business visas from countries with high visa overstay rates will be expected to put down no less than $5,000, the department said in a public notice. Visitors who fail to leave the United States before their visa expires will forfeit their bond; those who comply with their visa requirements will get their money back.

The notice did not specify which countries would be subject to the program, saying only that they would be determined based on visa overstay data collected and published by the Department of Homeland Security.

The move is the Trump administration’s latest in a multifront effort to crack down on illegal immigration after President Trump made the issue the centerpiece of his 2024 campaign.

A notice in the Federal Register announcing the new rule called it “a key pillar of the Trump administration’s foreign policy to protect the United States from the clear national security threat posed by visa overstays and deficient screening and vetting.”

Citing Department of Homeland Security data from 2023, the notice said that more than 500,000 people admitted to the United States through air or sea ports of entry most likely remained in the country past the end of their authorized stay.

Visitors who are made to deposit bonds will be required to arrive and depart the United States from airports chosen to participate in the program, which the State Department said it would announce 15 days before the bonds were put in place.

The 12-month pilot program will also apply to foreign nationals from countries where “screening and vetting information is deemed deficient,” according to the notice, as well as people granted citizenship on the basis of promised investments or without a residency requirement.

Consular officers granting visas will determine the amount of the bond, according to the notice.

The program is meant to test the department’s past assumption that bond payments are “too cumbersome to be practical,” as the notice put it.

Consular officers already have the authority to impose bonds on visa applicants, the notice said, but noted that the State Department’s official Foreign Affairs Manual declared that “such bonds will rarely, if ever, be used.” It called practical considerations “untested.”

The State Department planned to test a similar program late in the first Trump administration but did not carry it out after foreign travel ground to a virtual halt because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The online notice is scheduled to be published in the print edition of the Federal Register on Tuesday, and will go into effect 15 days later, on Aug. 20.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/dc-visas-qkvl/dc-visas-qkvl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 02:57:10.121844

The administration has already stationed troops along the Southwest border and, in June, sent soldiers to quell protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, a likely violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.
“Stephen has been clear in all the meetings: More military, faster,” a Trump adviser told Axios.

On July 30, the Times reported that ICE officials had sent a memo to field offices stating that troops will help with “alien processing,” which the Times defined as paperwork related to a person’s detention.

“This is the first time this has ever happened that the National Guard has been used to support immigration enforcement and deportation operations within the interior of the country,” Joseph Nunn, who is counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told Truthout.

The administration has already stationed troops along the Southwest border and, in June, sent soldiers to quell protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, a likely violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.

The Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 statute, bars federal armed forces from participating in civilian law enforcement activities unless authorized by law. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reportedly encouraged Trump to send the military to Los Angeles. Miller crafted many of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies.

“Stephen has been clear in all the meetings: More military, faster,” a Trump adviser told Axios.

In an apparently unprecedented move, the Department of Defense (DOD) has deployed personnel from the Marine Corps and Naval Reserve to assist with “case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing” of immigrants at ICE jails, according to a July 25 statement on DOD’s website. The Department said that National Guard troops will take over these duties and will also perform “specific operational needs [that] may require direct interaction with individuals in ICE custody.”

Nunn says deploying troops to work in immigration jails is not a clear violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. However, if National Guard soldiers perform law enforcement duties at the direction of federal officers, then he would consider that a violation of the statute. Those duties could include physically restraining or searching a person in custody, or questioning them about their immigration status.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of Detention Watch Network, called the military deployments “another marker of an authoritarian regime,” noting that the Trump administration has also announced plans to detain immigrants on military bases. In January, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of Defense and DHS to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay to “full capacity to provide additional detention space” for immigrants.

“ICE’s partnership with the Department of Defense continues to deepen, making the agency a key collaborator in the massive expansion of the immigration detention system, which is already operating at a historic high,” Ghandehari said in a statement. “It’s clear Trump and Stephen Miller are driven by a racist compulsion and will stop at nothing to proliferate hateful ideologies, intimidate government agencies, and disregard local elected leaders with the goal of villainizing all immigrants.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-4-Marines-LA-Protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:58.627168
