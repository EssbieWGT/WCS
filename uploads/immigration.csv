A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government's failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: 'After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.'

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said: 'Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people's liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.'

Fr. Brett O'Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: 'JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group's visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.'

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: 'Australia's mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government's obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.'

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: 'This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia's immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.'

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: 'Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.'

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: 'Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”) , a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 16.9% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (“ Ellomay Luzon Energy ”).

On November 30, 2025, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the “ Luzon Group ”), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, holds 33.75% of Dorad, published its quarterly report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the quarterly report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.

The financial statements of Dorad as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay’s shareholders with access to Dorad’s financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation of Dorad’s financial results .

Dorad Financial Highlights

Dorad’s revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 919.1 million.

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 205.8 million.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended September 30 , 202 5 , which include the summer month s of July-September , are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility and regulatory changes , the results included herein may not be indicative of third quarter results in the future or comparable to third quarter results in the past .

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad’s financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

(Nasdaq: RDNT), today unveils an expanded portfolio at RSNA 2025, introducing next-generation imaging informatics and clinical AI solutions. The company is announcing new offerings and major enhancements across its portfolio, spanning disease detection, assessment and monitoring, remote scanning, image management and interpretation, center operations and AI orchestration—all designed to transform the imaging experience and advance population health.

At RSNA this year, DeepHealth showcases an expanded, integrated portfolio of AI-powered solutions that demonstrate real-world impact in addressing key healthcare challenges such as disconnected patient engagement, strained workforce, inconsistent clinical outcomes and technology, data and workflow fragmentation.

Unifying the Imaging Experience

DeepHealth connects siloed tools, teams, and workflows to automate and orchestrate key tasks in the end-to-end imaging experience. DeepHealth showcases these solutions at RSNA through its enterprise imaging and operations portfolio that includes:

Diagnostic Suite™ 1 — Accelerating and Automating Radiology : DeepHealth’s cloud-first enterprise image management and interpretation solutions deliver capabilities to automate and accelerate radiology at scale.

As of September 2022, roughly 88,500 Afghan nationals entered the U.S. via the “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Going after a large group of people, most of which I think are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work every day, the U.S. government harassing them years later does not make a lot of sense to me,” Kelly told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The Trump administration indefinitely paused immigration from Afghanistan on Wednesday, hours after two West Virginia National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C. The suspected gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 via a program for those who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan.

As of September 2022, roughly 88,500 Afghan nationals entered the U.S. via the “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In total, 195,000 Afghan migrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

One Guard member, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her wounds on Thursday. Another, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition.

President Trump said Wednesday evening that his administration will review the case of every Afghan migrant who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The next day, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said his agency, at the direction of the president, will reexamine green cards held by individuals from 19 countries, including Afghanistan.

The State Department has also paused visas for Afghan nationals in the wake of the shooting.

Kelly said Sunday that while individuals entering the country “should be vetted,” those who assisted the U.S. during the war “provided a valuable service to the United States of America and deserve an opportunity to resettle in our country.”

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.)","A deadly shooting involving two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., earlier this week rattled officials across the nation, and has spurred an increased presence of federal law enforcement in the nation’s capital and an intensification of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

West Virginia National Guard members U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom were both shot. Beckstrom died on Thursday, while Wolfe remained in critical condition on Saturday.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey (R) is expected to discuss the violent event and honor the two service members during an appearance on Fox News’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

In response to the shooting, which occurred blocks from the White House on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said 500 additional National Guard troops will join forces with members already deployed to Washington.

“This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington, D.C., safe and beautiful,” Hegseth told reporters on Wednesday during his trip to the Dominican Republic.

“The drop in crime has been historic. The increase in safety and security has been historic. But if criminals want to conduct things like this, violence against America’s best, we will never back down. President Trump will never back down. That’s why the American people elected him,” he added.

Hours after the shooting, the president said his administration would also place an indefinite pause on immigration from Afghanistan, the country of origin for the suspected shooter.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the United States in September 2021 through the program “Operation Allies Welcome,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Wednesday night.

“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States … under the Biden Administration,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a Wednesday statement on X.

“I will not utter this depraved individual’s name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants,” she added.

Noem is slated to make appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” where she will likely discuss further protocols being implemented in the aftermath of the shooting.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Department of Justice will seek the death penalty against Lakanwal. Bondi is scheduled to make an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox News Sunday.”

Bondi will likely discuss the potential of capital punishment for the suspected shooter in addition to his charges, which include three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and one count of first-degree murder, according the office of U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro.

White Hose border czar Tom Homan, meanwhile, is set to appear on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” and could provide details on how the shooting is impacting the Trump administration’s moves to restrict immigration.

Amid a rabid political climate, Trump and Hegseth have tussled with Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and five other Democratic lawmakers over a video in which the group urged military members not to abide by “illegal orders.”

Trump described the clip as an act of “sedition” which could be “punishable by death,” sparking outrage from elected officials far and wide while Hegseth said the Pentagon would launch an investigation into Kelly for “serious allegations of misconduct.”

Kelly will likely share his response to the president’s remarks during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He’ll be joined by his colleagues, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who may also weigh in on Kelly’s feud with the president.

Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.
The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns.
They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants.
“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""","The US Department of Homeland Security has cut its civil rights watchdog staff, sparking lawsuits and whistleblower complaints over unchecked abuses under Trump administration.

The federal watchdog system at US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) overseeing complaints regarding civil rights violations have been dismantled, which has led to the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity"", according to experts.

According to The Guardian, former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

During President Trump’s second term, hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, known as watchdogs, have been fired. The main watchdog team overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine, The Guardian reported.

A group of expelled watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP). Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,"" said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.""

In response to reports and complaints of abuses, The Guardian quoted the DHS stating through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin stating that there are “no sub-prime"" conditions in immigration custody in the US.

Last week, McLaughlin issued a statement saying: ““These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.""

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.""

Meanwhile, senior director of GAP Dana Gold pointed out that without a proper oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity"".

The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns. That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.""

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,"" the former official explained in a telephone interview with The Guardian. “By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""

said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.","CHINATOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- Immigration advocates, elected officials and community members will rally and speak out on Sunday after multiple people were arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in Lower Manhattan.

A rally and press conference will be held at Howard Street and Centre Street at 1 p.m. in Chinatown following Saturday's demonstration and arrests.

It all started around noon on Saturday when protesters gathered outside of 209 Centre Street and blocked streets, building and exits.

The area has been a hotbed for Federal law enforcement activity over the last month or so, with ICE cracking down on Canal Street. On Saturday afternoon, protesters converged on a garage apparently used by authorities - and things got heated.

A total of 15 people were arrested. The NYPD says the anti-ICE demonstration quickly started after a social media post.

The demonstration is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the nation between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump's administration crackdown on immigration.

The goal was to stop federal immigration vehicles from leaving the parking garage, but instead, protesters ended up in a standoff with the NYPD. Police say when the demonstrators did not disperse, and some started throwing debris, officers began making the arrests.

The arrests are being condemned by the New York Immigration Coalition.

""There's a report right now that we're following up on of an older gentleman and his daughter who were arrested who had nothing to do with anything and were just walking. So, this is a moment for all of us to ask the question of 'does the NYPD protect New York City residents or is it going to continue to harm them through collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement?'"" said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that protesters gathered after the social media post. The DHS released a statement following Saturday's protest, saying in part, ""When individuals broadcast the location of ICE, they are putting a target on the backs of officers... We are grateful for the NYPD officers that responded to these violent agitators.""

Sources tell Eyewitness News the special agent in charge of the New York Homeland Security Field Office Ricky Patel called NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch later in the afternoon to apologize for what happened.

Tisch told Patel it was 'unacceptable' and put Federal agents and police officers in harm's way -- and if this activity continues someone will get hurt.

Protesters at Saturday's demonstration said they were trying to prevent another large-scale ICE raid, at least two of which were conducted on Canal Street over the past month.

Caracas, which views a large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean as a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro, slammed Trump's warning as a ""colonialist threat.""

""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,"" Trump wrote on social media, ""please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.""

He did not elaborate, but after months of deadly U.S. strikes on alleged drug-running boats, speculation is mounting that Washington may launch some sort of military operation on Venezuelan soil.

Trump's warning comes days after U.S. aviation regulators told airlines to use increased caution near Venezuela over the mounting tensions, prompting multiple major carriers to suspend flights.

Maduro's government then issued a ban on the airlines for ""joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government.""

A statement by the Venezuelan foreign ministry called the U.S. president's latest remarks a ""new extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.""

It warned that the airspace disruptions would also mean a halt to repatriation flights of Venezuelan migrants from the United States, a key Trump administration initiative.

Venezuela's military Saturday also conducted exercises along coastal areas, with video broadcast on state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being maneuvered.

'By land'

Though Trump has not publicly threatened to use force to remove Maduro, he said this week that efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking ""by land"" would begin ""very soon.""

Maduro's re-election last year was widely rejected by the international community as fraudulent, while Washington also claims the leftist leader heads an alleged terrorist-designated drug cartel.

A steady buildup of U.S. naval and air assets in the region has seen the world's largest aircraft carrier move to the Caribbean, while American fighter jets and bombers have repeatedly flown off the Venezuelan coast in recent days.

U.S. media reported that, despite the bellicose posturing, Trump and Maduro spoke last week.

The New York Times reported Friday that Trump and Maduro had discussed a possible meeting, while the Wall Street Journal on Saturday said the conversation also included conditions of amnesty if Maduro were to step down.

Amid fears that Trump may launch a major operation in Venezuela, members of U.S. Congress – both Democrats and the president's own Republican Party – have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.

""President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Sunday on X.

""Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war,"" he added.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said similarly: ""Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.""

Congress

However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham cheered on Trump, writing on X that the president's ""strong commitment to end this madness in Venezuela will save countless American lives.""

Trump is also facing congressional pressure over recent media reports that the U.S. military launched a second missile at survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in September.

Leaders of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have released separate statements saying they would be investigating the strike, which legal experts say could amount to a war crime.

With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the Trump administration has so far largely escaped probing of its controversial anti-trafficking campaign.

Since the operation began in September, at least 83 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

Washington has yet to release evidence that the vessels it targeted were used to smuggle drugs or posed a threat to the United States, and experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/800x531/414161.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:57:30.056205

The vote comes one week after hundreds of people filled city council chambers to urge Salem leaders to take action against what they called unconstitutional and fearmongering ICE sweeps.

Communities across Oregon are reeling from mass immigration arrests.

After at least 35 people were arrested in Woodburn by ICE in late October, some residents in the 60% Hispanic city said they are afraid to leave their homes, hesitant to buy groceries and are questioning whether to go to work. Businesses reported as much as an 80% drop in customer traffic.

Woodburn City Council declared a state of emergency on Nov. 21 in response to the impact.

At least 24 people were arrested by ICE in Salem on Nov. 11, the highest one-day total in Salem in many years.

Dozens of people testified about racial profiling, violence and uncertainty wrought by ICE.

A vote brought forth by Councilor Linda Nishioka to reaffirm Salem as an inclusive city and its status as a sanctuary city passed in a 7-2 vote.

A separate motion from Councilor Vanessa Nordyke to have City Manager Krishna Namburi craft a declaration for a vote during the Dec. 1 meeting passed in a 6-3 vote, with Mayor Julie Hoy and Councilors Deanna Gwyn and Shane Matthews voting no.

The declaration condemns the unconstitutional use of ICE sweeps, especially when politically motivated and done without due process. It calls on Oregon's members of Congress to enact legislation to protect immigrant and vulnerable communities like mask bans and identification requirements.

The declaration would authorize the following actions:

Coordination with community partners, including immigrant rights advocates, legal services providers, educational institutions, local business owners, neighborhood leaders, and faith leaders, to support programs for communication and outreach for the emergency impacts of federal immigration enforcement.

Consider implementation of legally defensible programs, policies and resources that protect and support employees and the community.

Provide training to city employees on city and state sanctuary policies and laws, including protocols for employees to follow in the event federal immigration authorities appear at city facilities.

Regular review of programs and services to identify ways to further enhance the goals of this declaration and implement best practices and policies for communities impacted by immigration.

Provide periodic reports to the council regarding the implementation of this declaration.

Some requests from the public, including calls for ""sanctuary zones"" at schools and the suspension of Flock camera use that could go to federal officials, were not included in the resolution.

City officials said the city does not have authority over Salem-Keizer Public Schools to create sanctuary zones. Police officials said they do not use Flock systems and instead use an automated license plate recognition program that is not shared with federal immigration enforcement agencies.

Other Salem City Council agenda items

A vote on authorizing Namburi to execute a cooperative improvement agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation for the Center Street Bridge project.

A presentation on updates to the Center Street Seismic Retrofit Project.

A vote on exempting the Willow Lake Pollution Control Facility South Secondary Clarifiers Rehabilitation Project from the typical competitive bidding process.

On a recent evening, she was on patrol, part of a group of Japanese Americans who are keeping a watchful eye on the actions of immigration agents in Los Angeles.

“I definitely think about my family when we organize, when we go out on patrols, because that could have been my family in prison,” said Ms. Oba, 33. “It’s just a difference of what, like, 80 years?”

During World War II, Ms. Oba’s grandparents were among the more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were forced by the federal government to live for years in remote, hastily constructed internment camps across the West.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, backed by the Supreme Court, treated the Japanese Americans as national security threats because of their ethnicity. Families left behind communities, businesses, homes and even pets. Some of them never returned. It wasn’t until the Reagan administration that the government apologized and said it would pay compensation to families who were affected.

Now, as the Trump administration carries out its immigration crackdown, Japanese Americans see chilling similarities to what their families experienced.

The federal government’s current efforts have focused on arresting and deporting Latinos who don’t have legal status in the United States. That contrasts with the situation in the 1940s, when most of the Japanese Americans held in detention camps were U.S. citizens.

But to many Japanese Americans, the images of uniformed federal agents ushering people onto buses, the mass detentions and the dehumanizing language used by government officials stir collective memories of the trauma faced by their own parents and grandparents.

Lisa Doi, 34, a board member of the Japanese American Citizens League’s chapter in Chicago, said that people who showed up to a recent event to connect community members with local rapid response networks were already seeing the parallels.

Japanese Americans tend to support Democrats at the polls and did so in the 2024 election, according to AAPI Data, a research organization focused on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. But this year, some have taken more concrete action to oppose the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

Japanese American groups have filed an amicus brief contesting President Trump’s recent invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that was also used to justify the imprisonment of Japanese Americans. They have denounced as a disgrace the government’s mass detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss, a former internment camp for Japanese Americans in Texas.

As a surge of federal agents put immigrant communities on edge in Chicago, Japanese American organizers marched, documented arrests and lined streets around schools to help protect parents who were afraid to pick up their children.

In Dublin, Calif., near San Francisco, camp survivors and Japanese taiko drummers rallied in July to oppose the proposed reopening of a federal prison to hold immigrants.

The alliance between Americans of Japanese and Mexican descents has been particularly strong in Los Angeles. Both include people who came to the United States with very little, worked as landscapers, cooks and farmers, and settled in urban neighborhoods where they were confined by redlining.

Ms. Oba and her partner, Nicole Suzuki, are part of Nikkei Progressives, a group founded by Japanese American activists in 2016 to push for immigrant rights. The group has raised money for undocumented immigrants affected by Los Angeles’s devastating wildfires and has served as advocates for migrants held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Adelanto, a desert community about 80 miles outside Los Angeles.

And as the Trump administration stepped up immigration raids across Southern California this year, the group started patrolling.

Ms. Suzuki, 28, said it was important to make sure that agents know that residents are watching what they do. On their weekly drives, Ms. Oba and Ms. Suzuki look out for unmarked vans, trucks with dark tinted windows or agents gathering behind the federal detention center.

“I think a lot of people lose hope that they have the power, that they can do anything about what’s happening,” Ms. Suzuki said. “But no — they could drive around their neighborhood every now and then and keep an eye out.”

Japanese American groups have also rallied against what they say is the Trump administration’s attempt to erase their history.

To Latino immigrant rights leaders, Japanese Americans have been both allies and examples.

Angelica Salas, the executive director of CHIRLA, one of the leading immigrant rights groups in the state, cited stories of Mexican Californians watching over the property of their Japanese neighbors. There was also the case of Ralph Lazo, a Mexican American teenager who was the only known person who wasn’t of Japanese ancestry to report to the camps, in solidarity with his classmates.

Now, Ms. Salas said, Japanese American groups have been returning the support through rapid response networks and efforts to educate the public about their history.

“They remind everybody that we aren’t enemies. We are just people living our lives, running businesses,” she said.

That has held true, even when Little Tokyo was caught in the middle of clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers.

In June, when demonstrators were protesting immigration raids and Mr. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, law enforcement officers pushed them into Little Tokyo, which is right next to City Hall and the federal detention center. While the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful, when night fell, vandals broke windows and ransacked stores. Buildings, including the Japanese American museum, were heavily tagged.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/00-nat-japanese-americans-01-qklc/00-nat-japanese-americans-01-qklc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:01:09.661033

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration.
Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.
“A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.
But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website.","The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated.According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

The main avenue of resort now is public protest and legal action, Genovese said.

“We’re seeing really incredible acts of bravery by members of the public,” she said. “That’s been helpful at preventing detention in some ways, but also educating the public about the horrors of detention.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1c63b71514e711a2e8ffb7f1e3436c263c00c47/151_0_2006_1605/master/2006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f03ffccfa72ce3f3c2eeb36dc6e49148",N,,2025-11-30 08:01:14.134933

For one thing, his governing strategy has been all but unprecedented. Most presidents who have just won an election are forced to choose whether they want to cash in their political chips to get big things done or build up political capital for future elections. Trump has chosen the first fork in the road with an audacious policy agenda and massive expansions of presidential power. But at the same time, he’s trying to make future elections more promising not by improving his lagging popularity but by rigging the landscape via aggressive gerrymandering and efforts to manipulate voting rules. Because nearly all his power grabs have drawn legal challenges, much of his legacy remains up in the air, slowly moving through the federal court system toward reckonings in a Supreme Court that Trump has done much to shape.

What’s made this situation especially hard to figure out is the Supreme Court’s new habit of relying heavily on its “shadow docket.” This involves temporary rulings on emergency petitions, sometimes from the administration as it seeks relief from lower-court judges who have thwarted Trump’s high-speed agenda, and sometimes from Trump opponents who are trying to slow down the locomotive of unparalleled executive actions. So the state of play on any given issue depends on the interplay of both temporary and regular Supreme Court decisions with the implications of “shadow docket” rulings often clouded by terse orders with no explanation of the legal reasoning. It’s quite a quagmire.

The most familiar set of issues facing the Supreme Court, mostly because litigation on them began early in 2025, involves assertions of presidential authority over matters normally consigned to Congress, the courts, or independent federal agencies. Typically, the administration has found some obscure emergency power intended for situations like wars or natural disasters and asserted the president’s exclusive right to determine when and to what it applies. Accordingly, in 2025 Trump has declared nine separate “emergencies” that give him and his hirelings extraordinary powers over tariffs, exclusion or deportation of refugees, and energy policy, among other things.

Reinforcing these claims of executive preeminence has been a general argument, to which Supreme Court conservatives are receptive, that the president deserves great deference to his actions in any area affecting foreign relations or national security. Trump’s lawyers, for example, claim tariffs are so entwined with diplomacy that restricting his ability to obtain leverage through “trade deals” would hamstring his ability to conduct foreign relations. Similarly, they argue that border control and the immigration policies necessary to maintain it are inherently national-security matters where Congress and the courts should give the chief executive maximum leeway.

Big upcoming Supreme Court decisions involving executive authority include (1) a batch of tariffs cases that will determine whether the centerpiece of Trump’s economic policy will stand or fall; (2) appeals from lower-court decisions restricting the president’s power to arbitrarily deploy military units in U.S. cities; (3) a welter of immigration cases testing the administration’s power to cancel refugee status for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deport “illegals” to countries other than their own, and cancel “birthright citizenship” for children of undocumented immigrants born in this country; and (4) a test of the outer limits of presidential power over executive agencies, especially those created to be independent, like the Federal Reserve Board, which Trump wants to control personally.

In a very real sense, the Supreme Court will determine in the coming weeks and months whether a president determined to act outside traditional executive boundaries can or cannot be meaningfully restrained by Congress or the judiciary. As Christian Farias put it in New York, if the Court acts quickly and decisively in Trump’s favor, it could in just three months effectively make him king.

Aside from the scope of Trump’s powers, the Supreme Court will also have a lot to say about their duration by granting or denying him the power to rig the midterms and perpetuate Republican trifecta control of the federal government. That could make the difference between the Trump 2.0 train roaring toward the end of his presidency at full throttle and a chastened lame-duck president facing obstacles to his reign from a Congress partially controlled by the opposition.

Most immediately, the Supreme Court will decide whether a lower-court decision scrapping his first and most audacious gerrymandering bid will stand. This summer, Trump abruptly ordered Texas to conduct a rare mid-decade remapping of U.S. House districts to help insulate the GOP majority from the midterm electorate. Texas complied, but its new map giving Republicans five new districts was based on a blatantly racial justification provided by Trump’s Justice Department, which led to the adverse judicial ruling on November 18. Now Trump’s lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to intervene and reimpose the gerrymandered map on grounds that the lower court acted too late in the election cycle. The Court will also review a Justice Department suit claiming that the retaliatory Democratic gerrymander approved by California voters on November 4 was unconstitutionally racial in its motivations. If it chose to rule for Trump in both cases, the Supreme Court could swing the midterm map by as much as ten net House seats, aside from its effect on other gerrymandering disputes that might arise. That could be enough to protect the GOP majority in the House.

But the biggest blow to the midterm electorate’s ability to restrain Trump could come from a different case involving Louisiana, in which the Supreme Court has been invited to invalidate the minority vote rights guarantees in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That case has been argued and reargued before the Court, and a decision could arrive at almost any time. If the Supreme Court acts quickly and sweeps away what’s left of the VRA, it could produce a wave of instant gerrymanders in Republican-controlled states that would be free to dismantle House (and state legislative) districts designed to give Black and Latino citizens some minimal representation. In turn, that could tilt the national map far enough in the GOP’s direction that only a major Democratic wave could dislodge Trump’s total control of Washington.

It’s generally assumed that Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas will give Trump virtually everything he wants and that Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson will dissent powerfully. But three of the remaining Justices (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) owe their lifetime appointments to Trump, and Chief Justice John Roberts is the jurist who placed this president above the law in last year’s big immunity case.

If the Supreme Court’s conservative majority does give the 47th president a helping hand in expanding and maintaining his power, Democrats might be forced to reconsider their current tendency to subordinate “threat to democracy” warnings to crass material considerations in their midterm messaging. Yes, Trump’s economic policies and broken promises on “affordability” are damaging his and his party’s popularity significantly. But if he’s given royal authority to run wild and the ability to overcome any popular backlash at the polls, then the bad times could continue to roll for at least three more years.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2dc/b98/061454f56aebc966ac4f7183043a362dcc-supremecourt-trump.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:01:21.536705

The noise came from 10 drones and three Black Hawk helicopters, Watson says, which dropped armed men on neighbouring rooftops in Chicago's South Shore neighbourhood. On the ground, Watson saw agents deploy out of unmarked cars and rental vans.

“It was bringing people outside because it was such a disturbance. You have people that was thinking UFOs and stuff was landing,” Watson, who livestreamed the situation, told CBC News.

But it wasn't an alien invasion. It was a federal immigration raid involving hundreds of agents.

Eleanor McMullen-Webster was among those arrested.

“When I opened that door, I tell you, I saw that little red light, and that gun was right in my face,” McMullen-Webster told CBC.

Federal agents handcuffed the 64-year-old retiree and her husband, she says, directing them into an apartment where Venezuelan migrants were lined up against a wall.

The raid on the South Shore apartment complex was part of a larger initiative by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to capture the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois, according to a press release. Codenamed Operation Midway Blitz, the mission was to capture undocumented migrants allowed to “roam free on American streets” due to the state’s sanctuary policies.

That night, authorities arrested 37 immigrants, mostly Venezuelans, though none have been charged.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says two of them are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan transnational criminal group the U.S. designated a terrorist organization in February, but didn't release names. One of those men denied any association with the organization in an interview with ProPublica.

After being held for more than an hour, McMullen-Webster and her husband were released, without an explanation.

“I felt this small,” said the Chicago resident, still furious at the “disrespectful” way she was treated.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has faced sharp criticism, including from former president Barack Obama and Pope Leo, who is from Chicago. Both admonished the vilification of migrants.

But the idea of “saving” Chicago has been ongoing for years.

While running for president in 2016, Trump frequently invoked the city’s violent crime rate, calling Chicago a “war zone” and saying minorities in “inner cities” were “living in hell.”

Two weeks before his assassination, MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk — a Chicago native — spoke out in favour of Trump's efforts to apprehend ""illegal criminals” trying to “take over” the U.S. “from within.” At Kirk’s memorial, Trump said one of the last things Kirk said to him was, “Please, sir, save Chicago.”

“We're going to do that,” Trump told the crowd. “We're going to save Chicago from horrible crime.”

But in the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, Chicagoans themselves are divided over who the criminals are — and who is ultimately responsible for keeping their city safe.

Troops sent to ‘straighten out’ Chicago

The helicopter-assisted ICE raids took place three weeks after Trump threatened the city in a post on Truth Social. It included an image of him as a military commander with the caption, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” a reference to the 1979 war film Apocalypse Now.

Trump’s rocky relationship with Chicago goes back years. In 2014, he built a 20-foot-tall steel sign spelling out his name on the city’s Trump Tower. The move drew widespread backlash, including from then-mayor Rahm Emanuel.

As president, Trump blasted the city’s tolerance of illegal immigration, saying violence in Chicago was “worse than some of the places … where you have wars going on.” He frequently took aim at local officials on social media, threatening to “send in the Feds” in January 2017.

Crime in “sanctuary” cities has been a focal point for the second Trump administration. After deploying the National Guard in August to address the “complete and total lawlessness” in Washington, D.C., he again vowed to send federal troops to “straighten out” Chicago.

Robert Reich, a former U.S. secretary of labour, suggested it's all a concerted effort to suppress the vote in the 2026 mid-term elections.

“He is saying to himself and maybe others quietly, this is a way to intimidate [residents],” Reich said. “‘If they're just afraid to be very public in any way, then I win, because they're not going to vote.’”

‘Absolute betrayal’ of American people

The force used by federal agents in the South Shore apartment complex is far from isolated.

In Evanston, Ill., a car was following a vehicle of DHS officers when agents slammed on the brakes, resulting in a crash. While arresting the activists, one of whom was severely beaten by officers, an immigration agent threatened to shoot a civilian filming the arrests.

“I believe that they're acting with total authority, but without any sort of oversight at all, and they should be held accountable for their actions,” said local resident David Brooks, who had a pistol pointed at him.

Michael Rodriguez, a representative for Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, characterized the immigration raids as an “absolute betrayal” of the U.S. Constitution and the American people.

“This is a disgrace to our country, to our legacy,"" he said. ""It will live in infamy.”

Democratic Chicago committeeman Raymond Lopez says the violent nature of the raids have made his constituents — many of whom are long-term undocumented, mostly Mexican immigrants — fearful of going outside.

‘Black Americans vs. brown illegals’

Despite growing opposition, some Chicago residents have welcomed Trump’s aggressive actions as a way to keep the city safe.

“When you place unvetted gang members into our buildings amongst us with our kids, then you put us in danger. And that's what we have seen in our communities,” said Danielle Carter-Walters, vice-president of grassroots conservative movement Chicago Flips Red.

The current violent crime rate in Chicago is down about 40 per cent from 2023, which had the most reported incidents in the last decade, city data shows. Crime across Illinois has followed a similar downward trend, though rates of homicide and rape remain higher than the national average.

Ramona Paravola, operations manager of Chicago Flips Red, says poor, often Black neighbourhoods were forced to absorb newcomers under the Biden administration — including more than 30,000 from Texas.

“They are not spreading the load out,” said Paravola, who believes politicians knew that adding migrant shelters to an “affluent white neighbourhood” would face greater backlash.

Seeing migrants receive help that Black Chicagoans have been demanding for years is another source of resentment. In 2024, for example, city officials invested more than $300 million US to address the migrant crisis — money, they say, should have been invested into their communities first.

“How does that happen when they told us that they didn't have these [funds]?” said Carter-Walters.

“It's not Black and brown people. It's Black Americans versus brown illegals,” said Paravola.

Paravola, whose husband is a retired Chicago police officer, says she supports pathways to citizenship for “Dreamers” who come to America, including undocumented migrants without violent criminal records.

“We're not racist,” she said. “We're just intelligent enough to see people as individuals, or as individual communities, and not Black and brown as a big lump.”

ICE facility ‘gates of hell,’ says pastor

Presbyterian minister Rev. David Black has witnessed the violent methods used against immigrants employed against protesters at the ICE detention facility in nearby Broadview, Ill.

Black was praying for ICE agents and calling on them to “repent” on Sept. 19 when officers on the roof of the facility shot him in the face, head and body with pepper balls.

Immediately after, video shows Black shouting, “God is watching you — and you will pay for this!”

“It seems like they've been testing out how much they can get away with … as they suppress free speech and try to dismantle the civil society of a major American city,” Black told CBC News.

When Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate, first visited the Broadview facility for a vigil in the summer, she said ICE “didn’t even board up the windows."" Since then, she has witnessed the “one-sided violence” by ICE agents escalate.

“People were dragged, beaten,” she said.

Abughazaleh, a journalist, was thrown to the ground herself at multiple rallies. In one video that went viral, Abughazaleh can be heard hitting the asphalt after being shoved by immigration officers.

“They shot pepper bullets at the sidewalk and said, ‘Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,’” she said.

Meanwhile, Sister JoAnn Persch, who worked with migrants in the Chicago area for 40 years, was repeatedly denied access to provide spiritual care to detainees at the Broadview facility. Authorities cited “safety reasons.”

“All these years I've been right with immigrants, I've never felt they were going to attack me and surely I was not going to attack them,” said the 91-year-old nun, who was not allowed inside to visit migrants during a Nov. 1 mass.

Earlier this month, the spiritual coalition Persch was a part of sued the federal government for what they allege are violations of First Amendment rights to religious freedom.

Persch, a Sister of Mercy who got a state law passed in 2009 to allow pastoral workers into immigration facilities, said the situation made her “extremely sad.”

“There's just so many human rights being violated in that building. So we just have to keep working for human and religious rights,” said Persch, who died on Nov. 14.

Border Patrol commander ‘outright lying’

Two months since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz, federal authorities and Chicago locals still find themselves at odds on whether the mission to “save” Chicago has succeeded.

At the end of October, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem boasted that agents “arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens including rapists, murderers and gang members” since September.

But a Chicago Tribune analysis of government records found that of 614 arrestees whose names were released by the Department of Justice, only 16 — or 2.6 per cent — had criminal histories.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has defended the agency’s tactics, asserting in an interview that their “operations are airtight — legal, ethical and moral.”

But the widespread use of force has led to judicial scrutiny of the government’s tactics in Chicago. Bovino was subpoenaed to appear in federal court about his agents’ use of force against protesters in the Chicago area, and in a 233-page ruling released Nov. 20, Judge Sara L. Ellis identified “inconsistencies” in his testimony.

Ellis said Bovino “appeared evasive” throughout his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to the plaintiffs’ questions or “outright lying.”

The judge wrote that videos contradicted Bovino’s claims that his agents’ use of force was justified.

Ellis’s ruling prevents federal agents from using tear gas against people who do not pose a threat. A federal appeals court paused the injunction on Nov. 19, calling it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.”

DHS did not respond to multiple requests from CBC News to interview Bovino.

U.S. Border Patrol agents ultimately left Chicago in mid-November. Committeeman Rodriguez believes resistance efforts in the city were a large factor.

“It wasn't just the weather. I think [federal agents] knew they encountered people that weren't gonna take their BS,” he said. “We know what makes us safe. We keep us safe. Not Donald Trump.”

But Abughazaleh believes this fight won't be “over” for years.

“We're living in a horror movie,” she said. “A lot of our most important systems are being razed to the ground. But that does mean that we have an opportunity to build something better.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/b0caa8fa-b7f5-437a-ba4f-d364e5e0c314,1764351415388/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C310%2C5961%2C3353%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-30 06:56:26.935725

The Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision in State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, is a significant follow-up to its earlier 2024 opinion in the same matter. While the first decision granted a limited writ of mandamus compelling the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office to obtain certain jail records from private contractors, this second opinion addresses two distinct issues:

whether the relator, an incarcerated requester, is entitled to statutory damages under Ohio’s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43; and

whether the sheriff should be held in contempt and sanctioned for alleged noncompliance with the court’s limited writ.

Relator Terry Brown, an inmate at Belmont Correctional Institution, sought records relating to the Columbiana County Jail’s intake and booking policies, personnel, and records-retention policies. The jail is operated under contracts with private administrators—Correctional Solutions Group, L.L.C. (“CSG”) and Community Education Centers, Inc./GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”). Brown initially obtained a limited writ ordering the sheriff to obtain specified records from these private entities and to certify nonexistence if records could not be found.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown moved for contempt and sanctions and also sought statutory damages. The majority opinion (DeWine, J.) denies both statutory damages and contempt. Justice Brunner concurs in part and dissents in part, agreeing that contempt is unwarranted but arguing that Brown should receive statutory damages.

The decision clarifies:

the evidentiary burden for statutory damages, particularly when requests are transmitted by a third party or by non-qualifying means such as fax;

the unresolved status of non-attorney “agents” transmitting requests on behalf of others;

the standards governing contempt for noncompliance with a public-records writ where third-party contractors hold the records; and

the continuing role of the quasi-agency doctrine in accessing records in the hands of private contractors, even as the court expresses skepticism about suing only the public office rather than the contractor directly.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Procedural Posture

In Brown v. Columbiana Cty. Jail, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court granted a limited writ of mandamus ordering the Corrections Division of the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Brian McLaughlin (“the sheriff”) to:

produce specific requested records to Brown; or

certify that such records do not exist.

The court required the sheriff to seek and obtain records from CSG and GEO, the private jail operators, under a quasi-agency theory of public-records jurisdiction. It specifically deferred ruling on statutory damages until the sheriff complied with the writ.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown responded with:

a motion, later amended, for contempt and sanctions, alleging noncompliance; and

a request for statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C).

B. Holding

The court holds:

Statutory damages denied. Brown failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that he transmitted his public-records requests in one of the statutorily qualifying ways (hand delivery, certified mail, or electronic submission) such that statutory damages are available.

Contempt and sanctions denied. Brown did not show that the sheriff disobeyed or resisted the court’s limited writ, as required for contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A).

C. Key Doctrinal Points

Transmission requirement for statutory damages: Even when a requester ultimately receives some records after litigation, statutory damages are not automatic. The requester bears the burden to prove proper transmission by a qualifying method.

Fax is not a qualifying method: Requests faxed to a public office do not support statutory damages.

Third-party email and agency: The court declines to decide whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when a non-attorney agent emails the request, but holds that Brown failed to prove that the friend who emailed his request was in fact his authorized agent.

Contempt standard: A public office is not in contempt where it has made good-faith efforts to comply with a limited writ ordering it to obtain records from private contractors, even if the contractors decline to produce certain categories of records or state that none exist.

III. Legal and Factual Background

A. The Underlying Public-Records Requests

Brown’s August 2023 requests to the sheriff concerned:

Policy records – policies on inmate intake and booking procedures, including specific policy-related “information” about:

lost, stolen, or misplaced inmate records;

drug testing and toxicity testing for impaired inmates; and

mental health and psychiatric evaluation processes at booking.

Personnel records – records about jail personnel for a specific historical period (January 1, 2017, to July 1, 2018).

Retention policies – records-retention schedules and related policies, including for jail activity logs.

He claims that:

he tried hand delivery but was refused;

he attempted certified mail, which was returned as undeliverable; and

he ultimately submitted the requests by fax.

Separately, a third party, Christine Serna, emailed the requests to the sheriff and averred in an affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.”

B. The Private Jail Administrators

Columbiana County contracts with:

GEO, which operated the jail from 2014 to approximately 2019; and

CSG, which began operating the jail in January 2022.

In the earlier phase of the case, the sheriff had responded that many of the requested records were not in his possession but instead were maintained by CSG (or, for earlier years, GEO), and thus Brown should direct his requests to those companies. Brown instead filed a mandamus action against the sheriff and the “Columbiana County Jail.” The court dismissed the jail as a non-entity but granted a limited writ against the sheriff.

C. The Limited Writ (2024 Decision) and Quasi-Agency

In Brown, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court declined to treat CSG and GEO as defendants because Brown did not sue them and had not made direct public-records requests to them. The court also found that its functional-equivalency line of cases (making certain private entities directly subject to the Public Records Act) did not apply, because the private contractors were not parties.

Instead, the court invoked a quasi-agency doctrine derived from State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990), holding that:

Records held by a private entity can be within the “jurisdiction” of a public office when they are created and maintained to carry out the public office’s duties and where the public office can monitor performance and access the records.

On that basis, the court ordered the sheriff to:

request and obtain relevant records from CSG and GEO; or

certify that such records do not exist.

Importantly, the court did not require that the sheriff maintain control over CSG or GEO for quasi-agency to apply; it was enough that the entities were performing a “delegated public duty.”

IV. Precedents and Authorities Cited

A. Public Records Act and Private Entities

R.C. 149.43 (Ohio Public Records Act): establishes the right of any person to inspect and obtain copies of public records, defines “public record,” and sets forth procedures and remedies, including statutory damages.

State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, 2006-Ohio-4854:

Establishes a strong presumption that private entities are not “public offices” subject to the Act.

Creates an exception where a private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.

State ex rel. Harm Reduction Ohio v. OneOhio Recovery Found., 2023-Ohio-1547:

Applies the functional-equivalency test to a private foundation, holding it subject to the Public Records Act.

Confirms that when a private entity is a functional equivalent of a public office, a requester may sue it directly in mandamus for access to records.

State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990):

Articulates the quasi-agency test used in the earlier phase of this case.

Holds that records in the possession of a private entity can be deemed public records if:

the private entity prepared the records to carry out the public office’s responsibilities;

the public office can monitor the private entity’s performance; and

the public office has access to the records for that purpose.

Also emphasizes, in construing R.C. 149.43(C), that a requester may sue either the public office or the person responsible for the records—a point later stressed in Justice Brunner’s opinion.

State ex rel. Armatas v. Plain Twp. Bd. of Trustees, 2021-Ohio-1176:

Confirms and applies the quasi-agency concept, requiring a public office to obtain records held by a private entity performing delegated public functions.

Forms the doctrinal backbone for the limited writ issued in the earlier Brown decision.

B. Statutory Damages and Methods of Transmission

R.C. 149.43(C)(2)–(3) (pre–April 9, 2025 version):

A requester may be entitled to statutory damages if a public office fails to comply with its obligations under the Public Records Act.

To be eligible, the request must be transmitted by:

hand delivery,

certified mail, or

electronic submission (e.g., email, and in some circumstances, web-based portals) as specified in the statute.

Effective April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 was amended (2024 Sub.H.B. No. 265) to bar statutory damages for persons committed to the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, but the court applies the pre-amendment version to Brown’s case.

State ex rel. Grim v. New Holland, 2024-Ohio-4822:

Holds that the requester bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, entitlement to statutory damages.

State ex rel. Sultaana v. Mansfield Corr. Inst., 2023-Ohio-1177:

Holds that faxed public-records requests do not qualify for statutory damages.

State ex rel. Brinkman v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., 2024-Ohio-5063:

Holds that a requester is eligible for statutory damages when his attorney submits public-records requests by email on his behalf.

Demonstrates that attorney-transmitted electronic requests are treated as requests by the client for statutory-damages purposes.

C. Scope of Requests: Information vs Records

State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, 2006-Ohio-6365:

Clarifies that the Public Records Act provides a right to records, not general “information.”

“Requests for information…are improper requests under R.C. 149.43.”

State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 1997-Ohio-104:

Holds that a request framed only as a demand for “information” rather than specific records is not a proper public-records request.

D. Contempt Statute and Agency Law

R.C. 2705.02(A):

Defines contempt to include “[d]isobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ.”

Provides the statutory basis for sanctions such as fines or imprisonment for contempt of court orders.

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (referenced by the majority):

Defines “disobedience” as refusal or negligence in obeying a command.

Guides the court’s analysis of whether the sheriff’s conduct qualifies as “disobedience.”

Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2020-Ohio-248 (10th Dist. App.) (cited by Justice Brunner):

Notes that an agency relationship can be implied; written documentation is not always required to establish agency authority.

Supports Brunner’s criticism of the majority’s apparent insistence on documentary proof of power of attorney or written authorization.

V. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

A. Statutory Damages: Transmission and Proof

1. Brown’s Methods of Transmission

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(2), to even be eligible for statutory damages, a requester must show that his request was transmitted by:

hand delivery to the public office; or

certified mail; or

electronic submission (e.g., email).

Brown relied on three methods:

Attempted hand delivery to the sheriff (allegedly refused).

Certified mail to the Columbiana County Jail, returned undeliverable.

Fax to the sheriff.

Email submitted by Serna, claiming to act as Brown’s agent.

2. Hand Delivery and Certified Mail: “Successful” Transmission

The majority holds that Brown did not carry his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, successful transmission by hand delivery or certified mail:

Brown’s affidavit asserts that he “attempted” hand delivery but was refused. He does not identify:

who refused the hand delivery; or

how, as an incarcerated person at Belmont Correctional Institution, he could have personally accomplished hand delivery to the sheriff in Columbiana County.

The certified-mail attempt was provably unsuccessful: the mailing was returned as “not deliverable as addressed.”

Because R.C. 149.43(C) contemplates actual delivery of the request by a specified method, not merely an attempt, the court concludes that Brown fails to prove successful transmission under either hand delivery or certified mail.

3. Faxed Requests: Categorical Exclusion

Brown faxed the requests to the sheriff, but under Sultaana, faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages. The majority applies this rule directly: fax submission cannot serve as the predicate for statutory damages.

4. Email by a Non-Attorney “Agent”

Serna submitted the public-records requests to the sheriff by email, stating in her affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.” Brown argued that this satisfied the electronic-submission requirement.

The majority’s analysis proceeds in two steps:

Unresolved legal question. The court notes it has never squarely addressed whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when his non-attorney agent (rather than the requester himself or his licensed attorney) transmits the email request. By contrast, Brinkman held that an attorney-sent email request qualifies the client for statutory damages.

No clear and convincing evidence of agency. The majority finds it unnecessary to answer that broader question because Brown did not sufficiently prove that Serna was in fact his agent:

Brown provided no documentation of any executed power of attorney.

Serna is not an attorney and does not claim to be licensed to practice law.

Her statement that she acted “with Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” is characterized as a conclusory assertion, insufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Accordingly, the court holds:

“Serna’s conclusory statement that she was acting ‘with Power of Attorney and “Agent Status” for Terry Brown’ is not clear and convincing evidence that Brown executed a power of attorney authorizing her as his agent.”

Because Brown fails to prove any qualifying transmission method, the court denies statutory damages altogether.

B. Contempt and Sanctions: Disobedience and Resistance

Brown sought to hold the sheriff in contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A) for:

alleged failures to produce policy records (requests 4, 5, 11, 12);

incomplete or missing personnel records (requests 1, 2, 6, 7); and

failure to provide a records-retention schedule specific to the jail.

The court’s contempt analysis emphasizes two key points:

The sheriff’s obligation is limited by the court’s writ. The writ required the sheriff to:

request records from CSG and GEO; and

provide Brown with the records obtained or certify nonexistence.

It did not empower the sheriff to compel CSG or GEO to maintain or create records, nor to override their determinations about nonexistence or overbreadth.

Contempt requires “disobedience” or “resistance.” Relying on dictionary definitions, the court distinguishes:

Disobedience – refusal or negligent failure to obey a command.

Resistance – active opposition to execution of a command.

The court finds that the sheriff:

complied with the writ by:

promptly requesting records from both CSG and GEO;

forwarding whatever records those companies provided; and

conveying their representations as to overbreadth or nonexistence.

did not obstruct or undermine Brown’s ability to narrow or clarify his requests; indeed, the sheriff:

transmitted CSG’s invitation to Brown to “be more specific” about the policy requests; and

affirmatively invited Brown to “discuss the outstanding records being sought” with the sheriff.

Any alleged gaps in the production stem, in the court’s view, from:

the vagueness or scope of Brown’s requests; or

the limitations asserted by CSG and GEO (e.g., that they had no statistical data, that they had no responsive personnel documents, or that no separate jail-specific retention schedule exists).

Because these are not actions of the sheriff in “disobedience” or “resistance” to the writ, the court finds no basis for contempt.

1. Policy-Records Requests (Nos. 4, 5, 11, 12)

Request No. 5 (“statistics on how often inmate case files or medical records are lost, stolen, or misplaced”):

CSG responded that it was “not in possession of any statistical data you have requested.”

The majority notes that even if individual incidents of lost or misplaced files occurred, this does not prove the existence of a statistical dataset; thus, the sheriff did not defy the writ by forwarding CSG’s statement of nonexistence.

Requests Nos. 4, 11, 12 (policy information on lost records; drug testing; mental-health evaluation):

CSG labeled these requests “overly broad” and invited Brown to specify more precisely the documents he sought.

CSG also stated that it was not required to “create information or documents that do not exist.”

The sheriff relayed this to Brown and further invited Brown to refine his requests.

Brown did not narrow or clarify, but instead moved for contempt.

The majority underscores that:

“True, CSG didn’t provide records that the sheriff asked it to provide. But any fault for that…lies with CSG, not the sheriff.”

Thus, the sheriff neither disobeyed nor resisted the writ as to policy records.

2. Personnel-Records Requests (Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7)

Requests Nos. 1, 6, 7:

GEO responded that it had no responsive records.

The sheriff forwarded GEO’s letter to Brown, thereby complying with the requirement to “obtain records or certify nonexistence” as communicated by the contractor.

Request No. 2:

GEO did provide some personnel records, which the sheriff transmitted to Brown.

Brown alleged that some temporary employee names and positions were omitted, suggesting incomplete production.

The majority notes:

Neither Brown nor the sheriff filed these documents in the Supreme Court record, making it impossible to assess the alleged omissions.

Any alleged omission is at best attributable to GEO, not the sheriff.

Again, the sheriff’s actions fit the court’s understanding of full compliance, not contemptuous resistance.

3. Records-Retention Schedule

Brown argued that he did not receive a “records-retention schedule for the Columbiana County Jail,” distinct from the sheriff’s office schedule.

The sheriff replied:

he has provided the only retention schedule he maintains, a seven-page document covering both sheriff’s office and jail records, including the daily jail activity log; and

no separate jail-only retention schedule exists.

Finding nothing in the record to contradict this, the court concludes that the sheriff complied with the writ. There is no contempt.

VI. Justice Brunner’s Concurrence in Part and Dissent in Part

A. Agreement on Contempt

Justice Brunner agrees that the sheriff complied with the limited writ and that contempt is unwarranted. She sees no basis to revisit the reasoning of the previous decision granting the writ under quasi-agency.

B. Critique of Majority’s Characterization of the Earlier Writ

Brunner resists the majority’s suggestion that Brown could or should have sued CSG and GEO directly:

She notes that private contractors in correctional settings often resist being characterized as public offices or as subject to the Public Records Act, citing recent litigation where private vendors have moved to dismiss on those grounds (e.g., Ware v. Pierce; pending motions by Aramark, Trinity Services Group, and Securus Technologies).

Under Mazzaro and R.C. 149.43(C), a mandamus action may be filed against either:

the public office (here, the sheriff’s office); or

the person responsible for public records (here, arguably CSG and GEO).

She stresses that Brown’s choice to sue only the sheriff’s office was lawful and effective; indeed, he prevailed in obtaining a limited writ.

In her view, it is ""unnecessary and overly critical"" for the majority to revisit and implicitly fault Brown’s litigation choices.

C. Statutory Damages: Agency and Evidence

Justice Brunner strongly disagrees with the majority’s denial of statutory damages. Her key points:

Delivery by email is established.

Brown’s affidavit states that, after other methods failed, the requests were submitted by fax and by email.

Serna’s affidavit confirms that she emailed two public-records requests on Brown’s behalf to the sheriff’s office.

These sworn statements, taken together, are sufficient to prove that the requests were delivered by email, satisfying the transmission requirement of R.C. 149.43(C)(3).

No dispute by the sheriff’s office.

The sheriff did not oppose damages on the ground that email transmission was defective or that Serna lacked authority; rather, the sheriff’s argument focused on a purported good-faith belief about not having to obtain records from private contractors.

In Brunner’s view, the majority raises an issue—non-attorney agency—that was never argued by the respondents, and then decides it against Brown without necessity.

Agency can be implied.

Citing Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, Brunner notes that an agency relationship does not always require written documentation.

Serna and Brown are both laypersons; Serna’s reference to “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” should be read as a lay description of her authority to send the email at Brown’s request.

Requiring formal, documentary proof of a power of attorney in this context is, in her view, an unwarranted evidentiary hurdle not supported by R.C. 149.43.

Good-faith reduction of damages rejected.

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(3)(a), statutory damages may be reduced if, based on existing law, a well-informed public office could reasonably believe its conduct complied with the statute.

The sheriff’s office claims that it in good faith believed it did not need to obtain records from the private jail administrators and could instead direct Brown to request them directly.

Brunner points out that Armatas (2021) had already held that a public office must obtain records from a private contractor in a quasi-agency relationship, and the court awarded damages there. Thus, the sheriff’s position was not “reasonable” under existing law.

On that basis, she would award Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, the maximum allowed, without reduction for good faith.

Brunner concludes that the majority’s denial of damages is premised on an “illusory and unnecessary inquiry” into Serna’s agency status and adds a requirement—documentary proof of power of attorney—that is not rooted in statute or precedent.

VII. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Mandamus

A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government officer or agency to do something the law clearly requires it to do. In the public-records context, mandamus is the primary vehicle for forcing compliance with the Public Records Act when a public office fails to produce requested records.

B. Statutory Damages under the Public Records Act

Statutory damages are a set amount of money made available by statute, not based on actual monetary loss. Under R.C. 149.43(C):

They are designed to encourage compliance with the Public Records Act and compensate requesters for delay or wrongful denial of records.

However, they are only available if:

the request was delivered via a qualifying method (hand delivery, certified mail, electronic submission); and

the public office failed to comply with certain statutory obligations.

As of April 9, 2025, inmates in state custody are no longer eligible for statutory damages, though this change does not retroactively affect Brown’s case.

C. Clear and Convincing Evidence

“Clear and convincing evidence” is a standard of proof higher than “preponderance of the evidence” (more likely than not) but lower than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” It requires evidence that produces a firm belief or conviction in the factfinder’s mind about the facts to be proven.

Here, Brown had to present clear and convincing evidence that he transmitted the request by a qualifying method. The majority found his evidence (particularly regarding hand delivery, certified mail, and Serna’s agency) insufficient at that elevated standard.

D. Quasi-Agency vs. Functional Equivalency

Functional Equivalency:

Asks whether a nominally private entity functions so much like a public office (e.g., in governance, funding, purpose, and level of public control) that it should itself be treated as a “public office” directly subject to the Public Records Act.

If so, requesters can sue the private entity directly.

Quasi-Agency:

Does not make the private entity a public office.

Instead, treats certain records in the contractor’s possession as being within the “jurisdiction” of the public office for purposes of public-records disclosure when:

they were prepared to carry out the public office’s duties,

the public office can monitor performance, and

the public office has access to the records.

The public office remains the mandamus respondent, but must obtain and produce records from the contractor where these elements are met.

E. Contempt of Court

Contempt is a court’s power to punish conduct that disobeys or obstructs its orders. Under R.C. 2705.02(A), contempt includes:

Disobedience – a refusal or negligent failure to do what a court order requires (e.g., ignoring a court-ordered obligation).

Resistance – actively opposing or hindering enforcement of the order (e.g., undermining or obstructing compliance).

In this case, the sheriff promptly requested documents from CSG and GEO, forwarded what he received, and transmitted their explanations of nonexistence or overbreadth. The court found no evidence that he refused to comply or actively obstructed compliance with the writ.

F. Requests for “Information” vs. Requests for “Records”

The Public Records Act guarantees access to records, not to general “information.” A proper request should describe records—documents, files, emails, logs, policies—rather than ask generalized questions.

The court notes (in a footnote) that Brown's wording (“policy information” on various topics) might be viewed as an improper request for information rather than records, but it declines to decide the issue because the sheriff did not raise it.

VIII. Impact and Implications

A. For Incarcerated Requesters and Statutory Damages

This case is a transitional decision, important both for how it applies the pre-2025 statutory regime and for what it implies going forward:

It underscores that imprisoned requesters must strictly satisfy procedural prerequisites to preserve statutory-damages claims, including:

ensuring successful delivery by a qualifying method; and

maintaining documentary or testimonial proof sufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

However, after April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 bars statutory damages to persons committed to ODRC custody, making the transmission issues litigated here largely academic for future inmate-requesters (though they can still obtain records and possibly court costs or other relief).

B. For Use of Agents and Third-Party Intermediaries

The decision leaves unresolved but fraught questions about using non-attorney agents to submit requests:

The majority avoids deciding whether statutory damages are available when a non-attorney agent emails a request on a requester’s behalf.

It signals that conclusory statements in an affidavit about “Power of Attorney” or “agent status” will not, by themselves, suffice; more concrete evidence of authorization may be needed to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Justice Brunner’s dissent suggests a more flexible, pragmatic approach: testimony that a friend was authorized to send the email may be enough, especially if unchallenged by the public office.

For practitioners and requesters:

If possible, submit requests personally by email or certified mail, or through a licensed attorney.

If relying on a non-attorney intermediary, consider:

executing a short written authorization; and

keeping documentation showing that the intermediary acted at the requester’s direction.

C. For Public Offices Working with Private Contractors

The opinion reinforces and clarifies obligations of public offices that outsource operations:

Public offices must request records from private contractors when a quasi-agency relationship exists.

However, they will generally not be held in contempt for the contractor’s refusal or limitations, so long as they:

make timely requests to the contractor;

forward all responsive records received; and

communicate to the requester any statements from the contractor regarding overbreadth or nonexistence.

This creates a practical division of responsibility:

The public office must act diligently and transparently; and

The private contractor bears responsibility (doctrinally and practically) for any underproduction, although the contractor may not be directly before the court unless separately sued or deemed a functional equivalent of a public office.

D. Contempt as an Enforcement Tool in Public-Records Cases

The court’s rigorous definition of “disobedience” and “resistance” somewhat narrows the use of contempt as an enforcement mechanism against public offices that rely on private contractors:

Even where records remain missing or incomplete, contempt will not lie if the public office has:

taken reasonable steps to comply;

documented those efforts; and

not obstructed or delayed production.

Requesters facing nonresponsive contractors may need to:

directly sue the contractor (if it is or may be a functional equivalent of a public office); or

seek expansion of the writ to bring the contractor into the case where legally possible.

E. Internal Division on Statutory Damages Standards

The sharp disagreement between the majority and Justice Brunner highlights a doctrinal tension:

How strictly should courts enforce technical prerequisites (like documentary proof of agency) for statutory damages?

To what extent should courts infer agency or rely on uncontradicted affidavits from laypersons?

Future cases may need to address squarely:

whether non-attorney agents can trigger statutory damages when they email a request on another’s behalf; and

what type and quantum of evidence is necessary to show an agency relationship for this purpose.

IX. Conclusion

State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, consolidates and extends several important strands of Ohio public-records law:

It confirms that statutory damages are never automatic; requesters must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that their requests were delivered by one of the specified methods in R.C. 149.43(C).

It reiterates that faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages and emphasizes the need for robust evidentiary support when requests are transmitted via intermediaries.

It clarifies that public offices that rely on private contractors may be obligated to seek records from those contractors under quasi-agency principles, but will not necessarily face contempt if the contractors do not comply, provided the public office has obeyed the court’s writ in good faith.

It underscores the ongoing complexity of public-records enforcement in a landscape increasingly populated by private vendors and jail/prison contractors, where lines of responsibility are often contested.

Justice Brunner’s separate opinion underscores a countervailing policy concern: that rigid, technical applications of statutory prerequisites and evidentiary standards may unduly limit the remedial force of the Public Records Act, especially for incarcerated and pro se requesters. She would have awarded Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, finding that existing quasi-agency caselaw gave the sheriff fair notice of his duties and that Brown’s affidavits sufficed to show valid email transmission.

Overall, Brown refines Ohio’s law on statutory damages and contempt in public-records litigation, particularly in the context of privatized correctional operations and third-party intermediaries. For public offices, it highlights the importance of prompt, documented efforts to obtain records from contractors and clear communication with requesters. For requesters and practitioners, it reinforces the need for careful attention to method of delivery, documentation of transmission and agency, and strategic consideration of whether and when to bring private entities directly into public-records litigation.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:58:05.288443

Call for Applications

Irish Yearbook of International Law: The editors of the Irish Yearbook of International Law welcome expressions of interest from persons interested in taking on the role of Editor(s) in Chief.

Since its foundation, the Yearbook has always had at least two Joint Editors-in-Chief, supported by an editorial board and advisory committee. The current Editors-in-Chief are James Gallen (DCU), Richard Collins (QUB) and Bríd Ní Ghráinne (Maynooth).

The primary responsibilities of the Editors-in-Chief are to liaise with the publisher (Hart Bloomsbury), generate and manage article submissions, oversee the commissioning and editing of correspondents’ reports, and to oversee generation and editing of book reviews. The Editors-in-Chief should have expertise in any area of Public or Private International Law and should have some connection with Ireland, for example, employment/ previous employment in Ireland and/or has received an educational qualification from an institution in Ireland. The IYIL is published once per year, and the new Editors-in-Chief should be in place to take the lead on the 2024 Yearbook (to be published in 2026). The outgoing Editors-in-Chief will provide transitional support.

Expressions of interest in the form of a cover letter and CV should be sent to the outgoing editors by 15 January 2026 (james.gallen@dcu.ie; rcollins@qub.ac.uk; brid.nighrainne@mu.ie). We welcome combined expressions of interest from persons proposing to act as Joint Editors-in-Chief, or expressions of interest from individuals. In the latter case, we may propose the role be shared between two or more persons who express an interest.

Calls for Papers

Human Rights and the Crises of Global Order: The Nordic Journal of Human Rights invites submissions of papers presenting innovative scholarship analysing the multiple challenges facing the international human rights project amid shifting global power relations in contemporary world politics and seeking to address issues such as:

How are international human rights institutions – and the actors within them – adapting to geopolitical and normative transformations?

How can we distinguish between the use and abuse of human rights claims in an increasingly plural global landscape?

How do human rights defenders and policymakers need to rethink strategies, concepts, and methodologies to confront the erosion of democracy, ongoing armed conflicts, or the evolving conditions for accountability and justice?

The journal takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights as legal, political, and social practice. We publish high-quality scholarship analysing the past, present and future of human rights from a variety of theoretical and methodological viewpoints. For more information, see here.

Climate Apartheid – Law, Economy, Culture: The “Climate Apartheid: Law, Economy, Culture” project at the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, invites papers for its conference on the same topic on 24-25 March 2026. The term ‘climate apartheid’ was first coined in 2007 by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to raise alarm about uneven patterns of climate change adaptation. In 2019, the concept gained more international attention when the Special Rapporteur Philip Alston warned the UN Human Rights Council that ‘climate apartheid’ was a ‘scenario’ in which the ‘wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.’ Since then, ‘climate apartheid’ has been invoked or implied in a range of contexts from academic analyses to climate and racial justice activism and concerning border enforcement and immigration policy, infrastructural development, the law, the development of emergent technologies, climate colonialism, responsibilities for loss and damage, climate adaptation, and climate-resilient urbanism. Despite the proliferation of the concept’s use, however, it remains unclear how it is and ought to be precisely comprehended and utilized, for whom the concept is available, how it can be distinguishable from other concepts including ‘climate justice’, and what opportunities or barriers it creates. In this conference we aim to take an interdisciplinary approach understand how climate apartheid is, has been, and could be used. Abstracts of up to 500 words are due 16 January; more details and a submission form are available here.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.
Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.
Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.
It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.","About 50 people took part in Indivisible Blair County’s “Lights for Liberty Vigil” near the Blair County Courthouse on Sunday evening to call attention to “the inhumane treatment of refugees, immigrants and their families,” as stated in a flier for the event.

Participants carried battery-operated candles, wore small placards reading “No Kings; No ICE; No Fear” attached to lanyards around their necks and they processed quietly along the sidewalk from the courthouse to the

Diamond, then back again via the sidewalk across the street.

There were a few friendly beeps, but no counter-protesters and no negative interactions with the general public, as police in patrol cars passed by periodically.

“I’m just fed up with the (Trump) administration,” said Billie Conrad of Altoona, as she walked back toward the courthouse on one of several circuits. “There’s a right way and a wrong way (to handle immigration), and they’re doing it the wrong way.”

Raised as a non-denominational Christian, Caleb McCoy of Altoona is angry that supporters of the administration’s policies present themselves as Christian nationalists.

“It turns my stomach,” said McCoy, who no longer considers himself a Christian. It’s a “betrayal” of “what we as a nation purport to stand for,” he said.

Warrantless arrests based on the color of arrestees’ skin or their accents, “blatant intentional infliction of harm,” violation of due process, “disregard of basic human rights,” and lack of accountability are among the issues that upset him, McCoy said.

A former longtime Republican who’s now a Democrat asked that only his first name be used – then asked for even that to be withheld.

He was involved in Republican politics for years and retains many Republican friends and associates and is “not looking to burn any bridges,” he said.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.

Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.

“Now, it’s a war,” he said. “(And) I disagree with the Republican side.”

He cited unpleasant interactions with passing motorists experienced by individuals who’ve protested in front of the office of U.S. Rep. John Joyce as evidence that things could get unpleasant for him.

He knows other Republicans who share his feelings about the administration – and also his reluctance to express misgivings publicly.

Those friends say they’ll make their statements in private at the ballot box, he said.

“People are afraid to speak up because of the backlash,” he said.

His presence in Hollidaysburg on Sunday was an effort “to help in a small way,” he said.

“Another guy standing there with a light,” he said.

It’s critical for groups like Indivisible to gain adherents, including people like him, locally, statewide and nationally, he said.

That will send a message to the politicians, he said.

As for the politicians, those who have fallen “in line need to get a backbone and stand up for what is right,” he said.

He has hope for the 2026 midterms, he said.

“We need to try and start making corrections to this problem,” he said.

Ed Koller of Carson Valley feels like the Trump administration has “broken (his) spirit.”

“I don’t know how this reprehensible human being got elected,” Koller said. “I don’t understand how the whole half of the country accepted this.”

As a Navy Seabee from 1978-82, he also doesn’t understand “how a military man can serve him,” Koller said.

Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.

Detentions of immigrants followed by their disappearance into other countries – sometimes countries other than where they originated, are among the administration’s actions that upset Bill Kelley of Tyrone.

This country’s economy needs immigrants, said Dave Galbraith.

They’re needed especially in states like California, where he once lived, he said.

Businesses that depend on immigrants are hurting for workers, he said.

Immigrants are avoiding places they need to go, for fear of arrest, he said.

Those include health care providers and places where they can get food, he said.

It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.

People generally believe in Constitutional due process – and that violations are “anathema” in the U.S., Taylor said.

“There is no evidence that a harsh and inhumane immigration policy makes the country safer or richer,” added Hamad.
""Reverse migration is not the policy of a democracy that embraces human rights and democratic values,"" concluded Hamad.","The American Human Rights Council (AHRC-USA) joins the nation in mourning the tragic loss of West Virginia National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, who was killed on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, in an ambush attack outside a Metro station in Washington, D.C. We also extend our heartfelt wishes for a full and speedy recovery to Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who was critically injured in the same attack.

The attack is under investigation as a possible terrorist attack. Authorities have identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who previously worked as a member of an Afghan CIA partner force in Afghanistan until 2021.

AHRC unequivocally condemns this vile act of violence, regardless of the motive of the shooter. At the same time, we caution against collective blame and generalizations that unfairly target Afghan asylees, migrants, or any community based on race, faith, or national origin.

The Trump administration has pursued restrictive, harsh, and inhumane immigration policies, and the recent shooting in Washington, D.C., is being used to intensify and escalate this agenda and as ammunition in the war on immigration, both legal and illegal.

The Wall Street Journal of November 28 published an article entitled ‘After D.C. National Guard Shooting, Trump Steps Up Immigration Crackdown: White House pushes for ‘reverse migration’ and aims to expand restrictions on nations it deems high risk,’ an article that should raise alarm in the human rights community. The harsh and inhumane immigration policy started before the shooting. No criminal violent act makes a barely legal and inhumane policy acceptable.

We recognize the importance of effective security vetting, as emphasized by President Trump, but stress that broad crackdowns or sweeping labels against entire communities are extreme measures that foster fear, anxiety, and mistrust. They are also ineffective and counterproductive. The US already has high-level vetting process in place.

AHRC stands in solidarity with the families of the victims, expresses its deepest condolences for the loss of Sarah Beckstrom, and prays for the recovery of Andrew Wolfe.

Despite the horrors and harm involved, all three stories show how important discussing lawlessness is to making accountability possible — now or in the future.

The responses from senior officials in the Trump administration — from President Donald Trump on down — to the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard troops sent from West Virginia to Washington, D.C. over the summer was immediately to assess collective guilt and assign collective punishment once an Afghan national was named as the suspect.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed Trump’s racist, anti-immigrant speech in response to the shooting, quickly blaming the Biden administration. An hour later, action. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — under Noem’s jurisdiction — announced that “all” immigration requests involving Afghan nationals had been “stopped indefinitely.” This — as Trump’s speech made clear — was an angle to further restricting immigration from people the Trump administration wants to keep out of America.

This is the stuff of Stephen Miller’s dreams, and he spent Thanksgiving making that clear to anyone who would read to his hate — including lashing out at The Wall Street Journal editorial board for opposing the administration’s racist collective-guilt response.

The head of USCIS followed up on Thanksgiving, announcing that this would go further than the Wednesday statement — both to encompass people already in the U.S. and countries beyond Afghanistan.

After Sarah Beckstrom, one of the West Virginia National Guard troops who was shot, died from her injuries on Thanksgiving, the hate pouring out of the administration only became more aggressive, more lawless.

To end that day, Trump issued a triptych of late-night, racist, anti-immigrant diatribes — horrifyingly discussing unconstitutionally and illegally “denaturaliz[ing]” people who “undermine domestic tranquility“ and “deport[ing]” foreign nationals who are “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

On Friday morning, DHS made clear that all of this was, yes, very fascist, indeed.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, apparently feeling left out, piped in on Friday evening to announce that he, too, was on board with the collective punishment plan.

As the collective-punishment campaign was building, however, the Trump administration was forced to address a second front in its lawlessness.

Around lunchtime on Friday, The Washington Post reported on the administration’s boat-strike murders. The report from Alex Horton and Ellen Nakashima about the first boat strike, on September 2, is alarming. Once analysts became “more confident“ that 11 people aboard the boat they were tracking were drug smugglers, the Post reported, this is what happened:

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said.

A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.

The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.

While purportedly attacking their reporting as “fake news,” Hegseth on Friday evening did not deny the key claim in the report about the second strike, stating, “As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.“

That is not the end of it, not at all. The response to the Post’s report from Jack Goldsmith — the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel official during the George W. Bush administration who withdrew the administration’s earlier “torture memos” — was perhaps the most notable immediate response.

“[T]here can be no conceivable legal justification for what the Washington Post reported earlier today,” he wrote at Executive Functions. “In short, if the Post’s facts are correct, it appears that Special Operations Forces committed murder when the ‘two men were blown apart in the water,’ as the Post put it.”

Ryan Goodman from Just Security reported on Saturday that the Former JAGs Working Group — a group of former military lawyers — echoed Goldsmith, concluding a white paper response, “[S]ince orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both.“

By Saturday night, bipartisan leaders of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee had issued strong statements.

The Senate leaders, Sens. Roger Wicker and Jack Reed, referencing “recent news reports — and the Department of Defense’s initial response — regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,“ stated that their committee had “directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”

The House leaders, Reps. Mike Rogers and Adam Smith, similarly stated that their committee is “committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean,” adding that they “take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”

Finally, and as I reported Friday, Chief Judge James Boasberg’s contempt inquiry over the March 15 flights — with, as of this past week, its increased focus on Noem, in addition to the then-key Justice Department leadership — is also proceeding into its next phase next week:

This weekend, then, illustrates three points at which the administration’s lawlessness can become a part of the public discussion — when officials announce lawless actions, reporting that follows lawlessness, and when orders from federal courts are issued seeking to hold officials accountable for lawlessness.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPVj!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63172e3b-a943-4916-bb3d-eac4f352a923_1208x890.png",N,,2025-11-30 01:56:23.132173

As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, dozens of demonstrators Saturday yelled “ICE out of New York!” at police officers standing in front of a parking garage on the edge of Chinatown, according to footage of the standoff posted on social media.

Agents from Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security tried to exit the garage in vehicles when protesters gathered, blocking them with their bodies and piles of garbage bags, according to the New York Times.

A few federal agents — perched on a higher floor of the garage — watched on.

Just before noon Saturday, authorities responded to a 911 call of a “disorderly group” near Centre Street and Howard Street who were blocking the street and, in some cases, throwing debris, the New York Police Department told The Independent.

“They were instructed multiple times to disperse, and they did not comply. As a result, multiple individuals were taken into custody,” police said.

The NYPD didn’t provide the exact number of protesters arrested. The Independent has asked DHS for more information about whether a nearby raid had been planned.

But the police presence didn’t calm the situation. Clashes continued after federal agents finally exited the garage around 1.15 p.m., with protesters trying to block their vehicles with recycling bins and bags of trash, online footage shows.

The Times estimated that about 200 people surrounded the garage, which is part of a government building.

In late October, an immigration raid targeted vendors just a few blocks away on Chinatown’s famed Canal Street. The raid resulted in the arrests of nine migrants and four protesters.

Earlier this month, Trump met with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Following their surprisingly warm meeting, Trump insisted that there wasn’t a need for federal presence in the Big Apple, after he repeatedly threatened to send troops there.

“Right now, other places need it more,” the president told reporters. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that.”

President Trump on Saturday pointed to a federal law that grants the president broad authority to restrict immigration just days after unveiling a sweeping new immigration agenda.

In a Truth Social post, Trump highlighted Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to ""suspend the entry"" of non-U.S. citizens whenever it is deemed ""detrimental"" to the national interest.

""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,"" Trump wrote, quoting the law.

“The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.” What is Temporary Protected Status?","Donald Trump plans to remove temporary immigration protections from thousands of Haitians. Trump’s plan became clear on Wednesday when the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) released a notice to announce that Haitian immigrants will lose Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, on Feb. 3. About 352,959 Haitians will lose protections as a result of this decision, Al Jazeera reported.

Why is Donald Trump taking away immigration protection from Haitians?

As the latest controversial move from the Trump administration became official on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security explained the decision to remove protections from Haitians. The department stated that violent gang activity is causing national security issues to the US. At the same time, the department gave a contradicting statement, saying Haiti is now safe enough for the protected immigrants to return.

“Ending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti reflects a necessary and strategic vote of confidence in the new chapter Haiti is turning,” the department stated, per Al Jazeera. “The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.”

What is Temporary Protected Status?

TPS is given to immigrants who are already living in the U.S., but they cannot return to their native country due to unsafe conditions. The program allows immigrants to work and study legally in the U.S. Citizens from about 17 countries were granted TPS earlier in the year. Some of the immigrants protected with TPS are from countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.

Haitians have been protected with TPS since 2010 when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake destroyed their country. More than 1.3 million Haitians were displaced due to the devastating earthquake, Al Jazeera reported. In recent years, many Haitians also fled their country due to dire economic conditions and political disruption.

While Trump continues to strip protection from Haitians, human rights advocates are still fighting for justice.

“Revoking Haitians’ legal immigration status that has kept them safe with their families in the US is cruel and dangerous,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement, per Al Jazeera. “Haitian immigrants have contributed immensely to our communities, neighborhoods and local economies, and without them, New York and this nation would not be the same.”","https://cms.blavity.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,slow-connection-quality=30,onerror=redirect/https://cms.blavity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2173420055.jpg",N,,2025-11-29 23:57:20.348593

The rule reduces the minimum wage that farmers must pay to agricultural guest workers imported under the H-2A visa.
The Department estimates that the wage cut will save farmers nearly 25% next year compared to what they paid visa workers this year.
The savings could be even greater if farmers also take the opportunity to cut the wages of non-visa farmworkers, U.S. citizens, legal residents, and undocumented immigrants, who make up 80% of the agricultural workforce.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins did damage control by saying that the administration’s goal remains that farms should have “a 100% American workforce” and that “ultimately, the answer on this is automation.”

So why is the Trump administration doing the exact opposite, encouraging farmers to import more foreign workers and to slow harvest mechanization? That’s what a recent Department of Labor regulation would do.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened a slew of aggressive actions to curtail legal migration to the U.S. in response to one National Guard member dying after being ambushed near the White House, though the scope of those moves and what legal or congressional mechanisms he may pursue remain unclear.

Trump, who has amplified his anti-immigration rhetoric in the wake of the shooting attack by an Afghan national, said late Thursday he would permanently pause migration from “all Third World Countries,” “terminate” what he called “illegal admissions” under former President Joe Biden and end federal benefits for non-citizens. The president also said he would deport foreign nationals deemed a security risk and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

The comments signal a renewed effort to sharply curtail even legal migration to the U.S. and scale up deportations of those already in the country. Trump’s administration, however, remained largely silent Friday on how any of those changes would be made, which countries would be targeted or how sweeping the actions could be — for instance, whether the president aims to deport significant numbers of people with legal status or even citizenship by denaturalizing them, as he put it.

On Friday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said in a social media post that the U.S. is halting all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The agency earlier announced it would review green cards of people from “countries of concern,” potentially widening efforts to remove legal permanent residents. Those countries are the 19 listed in a travel ban from earlier this year but whether the “third world” nations Trump cited match that list is not clear.

The travel ban imposed in June restricted travel by foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S., citing the need to counter the threat of terrorist attacks and safeguard the public. Those countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Another seven countries faced partial restrictions.

Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with U.S. forces and the CIA before arriving in the U.S. in 2021, intensifying scrutiny on the more than 190,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Most of those comprise people who assisted U.S. forces during the war and their families.

Since the shooting, the president has claimed Afghan evacuees received no vetting, waving a photo of one departure flight while speaking to the media Thursday. He’s also said Lakanwal simply “went cuckoo” even as the investigation into the gunman’s motives continues.

While the Trump administration has cast blame on the Biden team, Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit group, and would have undergone vetting, including for his work alongside U.S. forces fighting the Taliban. Advocacy groups have called on Lakanwal to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and without his case negatively affecting other Afghans in the U.S.

Even before this week’s shooting, the administration aggressively moved to slash legal migration or travel to the U.S., offering some insight into their priorities. Trump has dramatically lowered the refugee cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by high-skilled workers and revoked thousands of visas.

The administration is also planning to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden.

“If you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country,” top Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News Wednesday.

The June travel ban reinstated one of the most controversial measures from Trump’s first term, which went through numerous iterations and a protracted court fight before ultimately being upheld by the Supreme Court as “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.”

Trump said the latest ban protects the nation from terrorist attacks and public safety threats. The administration has said the 12 countries on the new list facing full bans were chosen because they pose a “very high” terrorism or national security risk to the U.S. and had deficient screening and vetting processes. The seven countries where travelers face a partial ban were chosen because they posed a “high” risk.

Officials over the holiday weekend sought to quickly signal they were acting on Trump’s threats, adding to confusion over what new steps the administration was taking.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said his department would issue regulations clarifying that refunds for certain income tax benefits were “no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens,” a plan the agency already announced the previous week, before the shooting.

Trump on Thursday night also called for “reverse migration,” but without detailing what that would entail.

Any new immigration moves by the president are likely to draw legal challenges.

The administration is already facing claims it is removing migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections. Multiple lawsuits in federal court allege wrongful deportation, including a transgender woman sent to Mexico despite an immigration judge’s order blocking the move because of her risk of being tortured or killed, and the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant from El Salvador who sued to challenge his mistaken deportation to his home country.

The Justice Department has admitted authorities made mistakes in several deportation cases, which could hinder future removal attempts. A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful. An analysis from Noah Feldman of Just Security data on immigration cases found “44 involve executive actions that have been blocked by the courts; 92 have been temporarily blocked, and 29 have been blocked pending appeal.”

Protesters clash with NYPD outside Lower Manhattan parking garage

Protesters told CBS News New York they arrived with a mission in mind — to prevent an ICE operation.

""We came down to lend our voices and our support against ICE,"" protester Michael Zorek said.

In a post on X, New York State Attorney General Letitia James wrote, in part, ""Today there was a planned federal operation in lower Manhattan.""

At one point, more than 100 protesters united to create a human barrier outside the parking garage.

""We're here to stand up for our communities, and we're here to stand up for our neighbors,"" protester Amanda Holden said. ""We do not agree with ripping families apart, with ICE ripping families apart. We'll do anything we can to stop it, and that includes putting our bodies on the line.""

Protesters clashed with NYPD officers and what appeared to be Department of Homeland Security officers. Groups of people could be seen throwing debris at police and standing in front of their vehicles.

""There were protesters that had been pepper-sprayed, sprayed with something else that looked kind of like it was orange, and then there were protesters that had bloody faces,"" Holden said.

Video shows white vans did eventually leave the garage.

""Hopefully we were able to stop them from doing stuff down here,"" Zorek said.

It is unclear if any raids were conducted. CBS News New York reached out to DHS twice on Saturday but did not immediately hear back.

The exact number of protesters arrested is unknown at this time. Video shows police officers detaining multiple people and placing them in NYPD vans.

Police confirmed multiple arrests Saturday after anti-ICE agitators were caught on video throwing trash cans and debris at officers near a government building in New York City.

The incident happened during an ongoing crackdown on illegal immigrants in Chinatown, which has spurred protests in the area for more than a month.

Officers responded to Centre and Howard streets, near the U.S. General Service Administration building in Lower Manhattan, just before noon on a report of disorderly protesters, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) told Fox News Digital.

The C.I.A. has not commented on the vetting process that brought the man, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, to the United States, and the former U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity given classified nature of C.I.A. partner units. But the agency’s director, John Ratcliffe, has faulted the Biden administration’s vetting of Mr. Lakanwal and said he “should have never been allowed to come here.” Mr. Lakanwal is accused of killing one of the National Guard members and critically wounding the other in the attack on Wednesday, just blocks from the White House.

Mr. Lakanwal was granted asylum in April, during the Trump administration, but it is not clear when the C.I.A. might have offered its endorsement of him.

The C.I.A. routinely wrote classified letters to add to immigration files to help members of their partner forces in Afghanistan win approval for asylum or parole claims, one of the officials said. American officials believed that the Afghans who had worked with the agency would be in particular danger if they remained behind under a Taliban-run government. The C.I.A.-backed units were responsible for the deaths and detention of Taliban leaders and fighters.

One former American official said the agency was diligent in advocating the immigration cases of all the people it worked with, and had a dedicated team to help them settle in the United States.

The agency also kept extensive biometric data, including retinal scans, on Afghans who served in their units, information that helped identify their partners among the thousands of Afghans who fled the country, according to former officials.

To join the partner forces, at first called Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams and later Zero Units, Afghans needed to get current force members to vouch for them, putting the reputation of their tribe or family on the line. As Afghans moved up in rank, they continued to be vetted regularly.

During the Afghanistan war, the C.I.A. also conducted polygraphs on members of its partner units to identify potential Taliban allies or those with anti-American sentiments, former officials said.

That intense vetting process in Afghanistan — and the work the units did evacuating people to the Kabul International Airport after the regular army collapsed in the face of the Taliban takeover — gave the agency confidence that people who had fought in their units posed no danger to Americans.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/29/multimedia/29dc-intel-ratcliffe-bvzf/29dc-intel-ratcliffe-bvzf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:56:30.835611

ICE agents needed to call in the NYPD, who arrested protesters after giving multiple warnings to stop blocking the sidewalk and the garage entrance.

Once the caravan of ICE agents moved out of the garage, NYPD officers were recorded pepper-spraying demonstrators as they tried to chase the departing motorcade, throwing debris and garbage from a nearby dumpster at their vehicles. The departing ICE agents drove to New Jersey to regroup, a law enforcement source told The News.

Several protesters were taken into custody after they ignored multiple warnings to back away from the building, the NYPD said. Some were charged with disorderly conduct for jumping the barricades and throwing garbage, and dragging planters and city garbage cans into the street. The exact numbers and charges were not immediately disclosed Saturday afternoon. At least 10 people were seen handcuffed and escorted away by cops as the protest raged on.

“I saw the NYPD pepper-spray, mace people,” protester Jay Walker, 58, told the Daily News. “(The protesters) were trying to impede the ICE trucks from going on.”

Another protester, Mia Kurzer, said she was knocked down to the ground during the ensuing chaos.

“I was trying to block ICE vehicles from arresting my neighbors,” Kurzer, 22, said.

The scheduled ICE operation was believed to be similar to one that occurred on Canal St. a month ago when agents, in a surprise raid, swooped in to target illegal street vendors. The protesters on Saturday managed to locate ICE’s rallying point — the garage — and quickly alerted fellow protesters to join them, sources said.

Monica Klein, a spokesperson for Mayor-elect Mamdani, condemned the planned ICE action.

“The Mayor-elect has made it clear — including to the President — that these raids are cruel and inhumane, and fail to advance genuine public safety. New York City’s more than 3 million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality and success, and the mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker, upholding our sanctuary laws, and deescalation rather than use of unnecessary force.”

Because of New York’s sanctuary city law, the NYPD is barred from helping the feds with civil immigration enforcement, but cops can be called in if a crime or violation is being committed, such as protesters blocking sidewalks or stopping traffic.

Ricky Patel, Homeland Security special agent in charge of the New York field office, called Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and apologized over the way the situation unfolded, a source with knowledge of the conversation said.

“She told him that what happened today is unacceptable,” the source said. “ICE has tried this twice with these shows of force that are intended to cause chaos and disorder on our streets, but all they are doing is putting the public, federal agents and her cops in harm’s way. She warned them that this needs to stop because, if it happens again, someone will get hurt and it will be entirely on them.”

The confrontation started just before noon as a large crowd dropped traffic cones and stood in front of the entrance to the Centre St. garage near Howard St., about a block from Canal St. Videos on news sites and social media show masked agents going back inside the garage as the protesters showed up. Some of them watched the gathering crowd from a second-floor landing.

Within an hour, dozens of protesters had converged on the garage. ICE agents called in the NYPD to set up barricades and push the protesters blocking the sidewalk and garage exit back so they could leave.

“Is this what you want, tearing America apart?” one protester demanded to know from an ICE agent.

Other protesters linked arms in front of the garage, chanting, “ICE out of New York!” as others pounded on the plastic barricades.

NYPD officials said they received a call for a disorderly group on Centre St., blocking egress from a building.

Cops made multiple arrests as they tried to move the protesters away from the garage entrance, the NYPD confirmed. According to a police source, the cops who pepper-sprayed protesters were from the Strategic Response Group. However, some of the SRG officers themselves were also seen staggering along and rubbing their eyes in pain after being pepper-sprayed.

Some protesters learned a procession of ICE agents were leaving the garage from another entrance and ran over there, dragging large planters and garbage cans into the middle of the street.

“One of the tactics that people use is that they take the garbage cans and push them into the street to try to impede the traffic,” Walker said. “When that happens, the garbage falls out.”

A request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned. Confrontations like this between ICE agents and protesters in other cities have resulted in stepped-up federal law enforcement activity amid the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

City Hall declined comment.

Last month’s raid on Canal Street also provoked a grass roots response. As dozens of ICE agents detained a total of nine allegedly undocumented vendors at the Oct. 21 enforcement action, a crowd of people gathered to protest, then followed the agents down to 26 Federal Plaza — ICE’s Manhattan processing and detention center — where a larger protest took place.",https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2248478940.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-29 20:56:45.719902

Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside.
Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.
But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast.
Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.","Earlier this year, the Trump administration reversed the convention that nobody would be snatched by immigration and customs enforcement, or ICE, by a school, church or hospital. Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back.

In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them. Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.

This isn’t unusual; people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home.

But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal?

It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped.

Hannah Arendt discussed the term Gleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not.

This is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they produce pie charts to show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that to detain 65,000 people is an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else.

But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was.

The US is currently trying to export its anti-migrant agenda. The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubio tells diplomats in Europe to “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.

Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters.

In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ac510825001e5bfe7c54ab6f590c6c31139f5d/511_0_4503_3602/master/4503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c4833d2f320374dc340a77a95a28dc91",N,,2025-11-29 15:56:52.124072

Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school.
Widespread effect on newcomer students In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years.
Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students.","Last school year, this Roybal Learning Center junior was doing well and making excellent grades. This year, as a senior, she’s almost dropped out several times and has talked of leaving the U.S. and reuniting with her mother, who was deported over the summer to Guatemala.

So far, the girl has remained in school, says teacher Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona. But many students in similar situations have not.

Across the nation, immigration raids and border restrictions have led to a drop in K-12 enrollment that appears to number in at least the tens of thousands, affecting Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami and elsewhere, based on figures provided by school district officials. The drop also reflects the lack of non-U.S.-born students, or “newcomers,” entering the nation’s public school systems.

For students who had already been attending U.S. schools, the decline is an indicator of disrupted learning — and, in some school districts, financial shortfalls.

“These declines reflect a climate of fear and instability created by ongoing immigration crackdowns, which disrupt family stability, housing and mobility,” said L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho. “When families are afraid to be seen, or when they cannot afford to remain in their communities, they are less likely to enroll, reenroll, or stay in public schools.”

At Roybal, just west of downtown L.A., there are at least 200 fewer students than anticipated, said Cardona, who teaches ethnic studies and serves as coordinator for a film and television magnet program. Before this year, she said, programs at the school had a waiting list.

“We’re not too sure if some students are sheltering in place, if they’re working, or if they got deported or self-deported,” Cardona said. “We’ve done our best to help them with resources but with a lot of the kiddos, we just don’t know what happened to them.”

Neither the U.S. Department of Education nor the Department of Homeland Security — which are charged with enforcing Trump administration education and immigration policy — responded immediately to a request for comment.

How Los Angeles Unified is affected

In the L.A. Unified School District, enrollment overall is down just over 4% compared with last year. This it is about 2% more than a projection based on factors other than immigration enforcement.

Carvalho said fears in immigrant communities “are now exacerbating preexisting factors that were already driving statewide enrollment declines — including falling birth rates, rising housing costs and broader economic pressures.”

In a school system with nearly 400,000 students, the difference this year between the anticipated decline and the actual decline is more than 7,000 students.

An indicator that speaks to the effect of immigration enforcement is the number of “newcomer” students.

Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school. This is an educational category, not an indication of whether a student resides legally in the country. California schools do not collect information about legal status — and a 1982 Supreme Court decision protects the right of immigrant children to receive a public education.

In 2023-24, L.A. Unified had 21,997 newcomers by the end of the school year, accounting for 5.2% of students. The end-of-year total for last year was 19,110 students — 4.7% of total enrollment and a decrease of 2,887 from the previous year.

At that point, President Trump had been in office for about six months — with a surge in immigration raids in Los Angeles spiking in June.

The enrollment trend continued this fall, with recent data showing an additional decline of 1,768 newcomers, bringing their enrollment to 17,342 and reducing newcomers to 4.4% of total enrollment.

“While newcomers have historically been a vibrant and growing part of our school communities, their enrollment has declined significantly over the past three years, with year-over-year decreases that mirror the uncertainty many families are living through,” Carvalho said.

The mother of the Roybal student was detained during a summer raid at the Vernon factory where she worked and then quickly deported, Cardona said. The student is staying with relatives and, with support from the school, remains in classes. But she also has to help care for two younger siblings and feels pressure to get a job.

“It’s distressing to us when she says that she’s going to have to drop out of school,” Cardona said. “It’s obvious that she is good at it and works hard at it, but she’s just preoccupied with ensuring that there’s funds so her siblings can reunite with her mom.”

District data suggest that many newcomers who were expected to return have not done so.

At the end of the 2024–25 school year, after accounting for graduates and families known to have relocated, 18,232 newcomer students were enrolled and expected to return this fall. Of these, 16,668 returned, 8.5% lower than anticipated.

Widespread effect on newcomer students

In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near the Perkins K-8 school.

About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staffers have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity.

But so far this school year, he hasn’t enrolled a single newcomer. Other families did not return when the new school year began. Overall, the district’s enrollment is on par with last year’s, according to a spokesperson. But at Hernandez’s school, the change is noticeable.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County Public Schools — formerly led by Carvalho — about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year — down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools, said the trend is “a sad reality.”

“I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,” Santos said. “And this country and our public schools — I’ll never get tired of saying it — gave me everything.”

Collectively, the enrollment declines in Miami-Dade erased about $70 million from the district’s budget, forcing administrators to scramble to cover the unexpected shortfall.

In northern Alabama, Albertville City Schools Supt. Bart Reeves said the district’s newcomer academy at a local high school hasn’t been enrolling any new students. Reeves’ district is home to one of Alabama’s largest Latino student populations, about 60% of all students.

Reeves said he expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.

Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students in the summer, compared with 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. The Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to 21 students from 111 last year.

In California, the financial effect of enrollment decreases are expected to hit hardest in later years. But unexpected enrollment losses can immediately force schools to reduce their teaching staff and combine classes a month or more into the school year.

Missing 200 students in Inglewood

At the Inglewood Unified School District, about 200 of the newest newcomers did not show up as anticipated, a drop of more than 50% in a school system with about 6,000 students.

In 2023-24, Inglewood Unified enrolled 391 students living in the U.S. a year or less. The following year that number was 312. This year the number is 109.

As with L.A. Unified, the Inglewood district had planned for declining enrollment, but the drop was steeper than expected.

“I’m really worried about those 200 kids who aren’t here,” said Inglewood Supt. Jim Morris. “That really is alarming data.”

For the students in school, overall district attendance has improved slightly, part of a districtwide push to get all students to class more often.

“It’s critically important that students and families know that the school is a place that they can trust, that the school is a place where they’re safe, and that the school is a place where whatever needs they have — we’re going to do our best to meet those needs,” Morris said.

In L.A. Unified similar efforts are underway, including at Roybal, where a few students are being picked up by bus directly from home to quell fears over ongoing immigration enforcement.

“Our responsibility is to ensure every child — regardless of where they were born — feels safe in our schools,” Carvalho said. “We will continue to stand firmly with our immigrant communities and protect every student’s right to a welcoming, stable and supportive education.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2b81a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F75%2Ff1f0558b4cce9a5f4e7c9c0e8798%2Fla-photos-1staff-464309-me-0829-csu-math-10-cmc.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:57:09.348333

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.
He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration's crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, ""was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,"" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. ""But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.""

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.""

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal ""should have never been allowed to come here,"" Trump called lax migration policies ""the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,"" and Vice President JD Vance said Biden's policy was ""opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.""

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration"" from a list of nearly 20 countries, ""terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,"" and ""remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States."" Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

""They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,"" said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump's problem.' That's not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.""

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called ""a hellhole on Earth"" on Thursday.

""These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What's new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

""Life was finally getting easier for me. I've learned to speak English. I found a better job,"" he said. ""But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they're now looking at me the same way as the shooter.""

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an ""extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,"" he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

""It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,"" he added.

That's going to be the number one category that's targeted by a broad-based absolute ban on legal immigration to the United States.
Liz Landers: David Bier from the Cato Institute, thank you so much for joining us this evening this holiday weekend.","Liz Landers:

OK, let's start with some of these social media posts from the president.

He wrote last night in a pair of posts demeaning immigrants and calling the country's immigration policies stupid. What's your reaction to that?

David Bier:

Well, first of all, this was a horrific attack. No one condones it. This is an individual who should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Unfortunately, what the president has taken away from this attack is that all of 53 million, as he says, immigrants to the United States, legal or illegal, are now seen as suspicious, as people who should be driven out of the United States, even denaturalized.

If you look at the rhetoric in that post, he can't find a single good thing to say about any of the immigrants from any country in the world. And that's really what's different. What I see here is, the president has for a long time talked about the problems with certain types of immigration, with illegal immigration, with refugees and others.

But this was really the broadest attack that I can remember on the immigrant population overall, both legal and illegal, even the naturalized citizens who have taken the oath to the Constitution of the United States.

Liz Landers:

Trump's post had a series of pledged reforms, including, but not limited to a permanent pause on migration from all Third World countries. We heard that a few moments ago.

Remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States. End all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens and denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.

How much of that can he follow through on?

David Bier:

Well, certainly, he's already trying to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in the history of the United States. He wants to deport millions and millions of people who are here illegally.

So now he's just adding to that campaign promise with trying to deport people who are in the country legally. Now, taking away someone who has illegal permanent residence, their status, is quite difficult. You have to prove your case against them. You have to bring that before an immigration judge and layout exactly what immigration law they violated.

And what he's talking about here, net asset, all this stuff, there is some ambiguity in the law, but there's not that much ambiguity, and it will be difficult for him to actually follow through on that promise and effectively deport most of the legal immigrants in the United States.

Liz Landers:

The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is saying that his agency is going to issue proposed regulations clarifying that the refunded portions of certain individual income tax benefits are no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens.

What benefits do those without legal status receive? And do we know whether what Bessent posted about will have any substantial impact?

David Bier:

Usually, these benefits are based on the Social Security numbers that are available to them. So, you submit your application for benefits along with your income tax return, checking that box that you have a Social Security number that is work-eligible, which is the basis for the refund or otherwise.

So I certainly support this type of proposal in terms of policy. Unfortunately, Congress is the one who sets the rules for this, and they just went through this tax reform bill that they put forward and they didn't go all the way with this idea effectively barring most noncitizens from those.

And so really what he's advocating for is Congress to change the law. We will see if that happens.

Liz Landers:

What trends have we seen in immigration recently? And what impact could these changes that we're seeing from the president being proposed, what could those have — impact on these immigration trends we're seeing?

David Bier:

Well, ultimately, the president's proposals from day one have been to restrict legal immigration. He's come out with a number of different ideas on those lines, including the total shutdown of the refugee program, a ban on most immigration from 19 different countries, restrictions on the H-1B high-skilled visa.

So, across all the different categories of immigration that we have, he's looking to restrict. This is the first time he's said an outright ban. And when you think about who gets most legal immigrant visas to come to the United States, it is spouses of U.S. citizens.

That's going to be the number one category that's targeted by a broad-based absolute ban on legal immigration to the United States. And that's really cutting at the heart of family values and a lot of the other things that conservatives like to talk about.

These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.","A day after two National Guard soldiers were shot, one fatally, in a “barbaric terrorist attack” in Washington, DC, President Trump declared that the United States will “permanently pause migration from all Third World countries”. The announcement landed just days after the US State Department issued an unprecedented statement, explaining that “mass migration poses an existential threat to Western civilization and undermines the stability of key American allies.”

Under new guidance, US embassies must now report the human-rights impacts of mass migration on receiving nations. These include crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assault patterns, community displacement, political retaliation against citizens who oppose mass migration, and two-tiered justice systems emerging for illegal immigrant offenders. This is a historic reframing. For the first time, mass migration is formally recognised as a human-rights issue for host societies, and sovereign governments are acknowledged to have the right — and obligation — to protect their people.

The suspected DC attacker, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, arrived in the US during the 2021 Kabul evacuation under Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April 2025 after claiming he had served alongside American forces in Kandahar. That credential was accepted as sufficient proof that he posed no threat.

Clearly, he did. As National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director Joe Kent put it: “It is true that the terrorist who conducted the attack in D.C. was ‘vetted’ by the intelligence community, however he was only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan.” Kent went on: “He was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.”

After Afghanistan collapsed, true vetting was impossible. Civil registries were unreliable even before Kabul fell. Afterwards, the US lost access entirely. Tens of thousands of evacuees were processed using fragmented or outdated data systems incapable of verifying identity, criminal history, or network affiliation. Inspector-general reports later confirmed that individuals with security flags nonetheless entered the United States.

The Trump administration has now announced a nationwide halt on all asylum decisions, and has instructed officers to apply “country-specific factors” for nationals from 19 high-risk nations. Beyond those 19 nations, the administration will almost certainly replace the informal term “Third World” with a defined list grounded in national-security findings. The issue is not income level or geography — it is whether a country can provide reliable identity, criminal, and security data. Many cannot. This is especially true for states dominated by cartels, transnational criminal organisations (TCOs), jihadist networks, or foreign intelligence proxies. In those cases, the United States has no basis to assume the risk at all.

Mass immigration flows deepen the challenge. Cartels, CCP-linked triads, Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, and foreign intelligence services increasingly control migration pipelines, using debt bondage and coercion to compel illegal immigrants into labour, sex trafficking, and revenue generation. Illegal populations become sub-governed communities, extensions of the networks that moved them. Every illegal immigrant is a financial asset and operational tool for these organisations. These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.

However, US law is built for moments like this. Under §212(f), a president may suspend “any class of aliens” whose entry is detrimental to national interests — a power upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018’s Trump v. Hawaii. And so the question before the country is simple: how can a state protect its citizens when it cannot verify who is entering or which foreign adversarial networks they belong to?

When a nation can no longer see, the first duty is to stop moving forward blindly. Recent US immigration policy has been misguided and far too lenient. Under such conditions, a pause is not a political statement: it is the minimum threshold of national security.",https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247361430.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 13:57:21.174311

(Andrew Wolfe, 24, another member of the National Guard, remains in the hospital in critical condition.)

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan war, is facing first-degree murder charges in connection with Wednesday’s shooting. The suspect arrived in the U.S. as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Trump’s latest posts threaten a new wave of severe consequences for people his administration deems illegal, including to “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

The president also vowed to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and “deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” before claiming, without evidence, that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone,” he wrote.

There were roughly 80,000 Somali nationals living in Minnesota in 2023, according to Minnesota Compass, out of a population of nearly 6 million people in the state.

Trump’s remarks about Somalis in Minnesota come after several instances of fraud were uncovered in state programs, including by Somali residents.

Republican members of Congress highlighted those claims in a letter last week seeking an investigation into the funnelling of “taxpayer dollars into the hands of the Al-Shabaab terrorist network in Somalia.”

Khalid Omar, an organizer with the interfaith group ISAIAH, said to the Guardian: “Collective punishment is wrong and racist, and using the actions of a few people to attack an entire community is un-American.”

“If anyone, regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity, committed fraud, they should be held accountable under the law as individuals,” he continued.

Trump’s remarks also drew criticism from UN agencies.

Asked to respond to Trump’s remarks about immigrants, UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

UN refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun echoed those sentiments.

“When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

Since Trump took office in January, his administration has deployed ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents to multiple American cities and have detained tens of thousands of foreign nationals.

In his recent post, Trump claimed — again, without evidence — that “most” of the 53 million foreign nationals currently living in the United States are “on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.”

As of Nov. 16, there were 65,135 people in ICE detention, 73.6 per cent of whom have no criminal record, according to Trac Immigration.

According to the Pew Research Centre, as of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4 per cent of the nation’s population.

This number was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the country.

In 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants, the research centre says.

Unauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status, including people with temporary protection from deportation and those with various forms of legal work permits.

Among the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status and 600,000 immigrants protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

In October, the Department of Homeland Security said more than two million “illegal aliens” had left the U.S., including 1.6 million who had “voluntarily self-deported” and more than 527,000 who were deported.

The department said it had made “historic strides to carry out President Trump’s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Afghan man accused of shooting two National Guard members will face first-degree murder charges for an attack that prompted President Donald Trump to declare he would freeze migration from “Third World Countries” to the U.S.

U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, said on Friday that there will be other charges as well against 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who she said ambushed the National Guardsmen from West Virginia near the White House on Wednesday.

In a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members on Thursday Trump called the shootings a “terrorist attack” and officials have said they were conducting a terrorism probe into Wednesday’s shooting.

“What happened at that crime is unmistakable. It is a premeditated murder,” Pirro told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” program. “We are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” she said.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Pirro told Fox that Beckstrom’s fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition.

On his Truth Social platform late Thursday, Trump escalated his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year he has stepped up arrests of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, cracked down on unlawful border crossings and stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of people.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” Trump said on Truth Social, referring to his predecessor.

After taking office in 2021, Biden reversed many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies from his first term, saying they blocked people in need of humanitarian protection and were unfairly discriminatory.

Trump did not name any countries. Asked about “Third World” countries, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Friday referred Reuters to 19 countries listed in a June travel ban.

Earlier, Homeland Security officials had said Trump ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the Biden administration and green cards issued to citizens of the 19 countries, which include Afghanistan.

SHOOTING PROMPTS SWEEPING MIGRATION REVIEWS

Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era immigration program to resettle thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and feared reprisal from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal.

More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under the program. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. He was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.

Investigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops.

The shootings may give Trump an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.

Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.

Lakanwal lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect’s wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump has said, “We’re looking at the whole situation with family.”

INTERNATIONAL GROUPS DEFEND ASYLUM SEEKER RIGHTS

U.N. agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country and to be given due process.

“We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, told Reuters.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

Jasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration at the Lebanese American University, said freezing Afghan applications or reconsidering thousands of approved asylum claims would disrupt families and local communities and erode the integrity of the migration system.

“While the recent incident is tragic, using an isolated incident to justify mass restrictions is inconsistent with evidence showing no link between refugee arrivals and increased crime,” Diab told Reuters.

Federal immigration agents equipped with tactical gear and rifles descended on downtown Los Angeles in armored trucks on June 6, arresting dozens of workers at an apparel factory. Within hours, another group of agents raided a Home Depot a few miles away, arresting day laborers who were looking for work.

Those operations quickly became a flashpoint, sparking spontaneous large-scale street protests. But President Donald Trump’s administration doubled down, and more high-profile raids followed as the White House sought to make good on the president’s promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in the nation’s history.

Immigration agents have since conducted sweeps at construction sites, restaurants, factories, car washes, and farms, upending life for undocumented workers nationwide. California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.

As militarized crackdowns have become more common in many parts of the country, employers and unions alike have taken new steps to protect their workers. In industries ranging from farmwork to garment production to food service, they have begun organizing defenses to make it harder for ICE to identify, detain and deport unauthorized immigrant employees who help keep their workplaces in business.

While the strategies vary, they share common goals: to find ways to inform immigrant workers about threats and, when possible, to shield them from detainment and deportation.

Adopt a Corner

On Aug. 6, day laborers gathered in front of the same Home Depot in Los Angeles that had been raided two months earlier. Tensions were still high in the city with ongoing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) actions, but the workers needed some income.

Suddenly, the back door of a Penske rental truck slid open from the inside to reveal nearly a dozen CBP agents in body armor lying in wait. They surged toward unsuspecting laborers, many of whom scattered in fear.

The raid, dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” by the Department of Homeland Security and captured on camera by a Fox News reporter embedded with the agents inside the truck, resulted in the arrests of more than a dozen undocumented immigrants.

Similar raids earlier in the year inspired the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a labor group that advocates for improved working conditions, to create the “Adopt a Corner” campaign.

Jose Madera, the director of the NDLON-affiliated Pasadena Community Job Center, said that the campaign encourages volunteers to go to places where immigrants regularly gather in search of work, to teach people about their rights. So far, volunteers have visited more than 100 locations across the country, Madera said.

The group’s volunteers hand out “Know Your Rights” materials like red cards, which are pocket-sized cutouts that explain what anyone — regardless of immigration status — can do when confronted by an immigration officer. But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.

The Pasadena Community Job Center also tells people in the community to record actions by authorities on cell phones so that when there is a raid, “there can be someone documenting the abuse, the violence, people’s constitutional rights being violated,” Madera said.

Organizers hope that documentation can serve both as evidence in lawsuits or in immigration courts, and as proof to show the public how the Trump administration is conducting immigration enforcement operations.

“Many Americans do not want to see this type of violence — masked men in unmarked cars, armed to the teeth, going into communities and causing this terror,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.

In the Fields

Federal agents staged massive immigration raids on a pair of California cannabis farms in the cities of Carpinteria and Camarillo on July 10, blocking roads with armored vehicles, launching tear gas and firing crowd control munitions at protesters.

Amid the chaos, Jaime Alanis Garcia — who had worked at Glass House Farms for a decade — was fleeing from immigration officers when he fell 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse, fracturing his neck and skull, according to NBC. Two days later, he died.

At those raids, federal agents arrested 361 people including American citizen and U.S. Army veteran George Retes.

More than a quarter of the state’s large agricultural workforce is undocumented — and nearly two-thirds are immigrants, more generally — leaving hundreds of thousands of laborers vulnerable to immigration crackdowns at work.

Since even before the Glass House Farms raids, the United Farm Workers union has been reaching out to employers to suggest ways to protect their employees.

Elizabeth Strater, vice president of UFW, told Capital & Main that one of the simplest things farmers can do is put up gates and fences to keep intruders out. For large fields that are too difficult or costly to encircle, Strater recommends a more impromptu tactic that, ironically, is sometimes used by law enforcement.

“If you’re out in flat, open fields where you can’t put a gate, what you can do is have the foreman, or whoever, park their vehicle so that it prevents access (by) someone who may not have your workers’ best interest at heart,” Strater said.

Such physical barriers are critical, Strater said, because while undocumented workers are legally protected by constitutional and statutory rights, federal agents have repeatedly been recorded ignoring basic protections.

Undocumented workers “have a right not to answer questions, but what happens when they assert that right is these absolutely unhinged, untrained, uncontrolled agents smash their windows and drag them out of their cars,” Strater said. “The utter lawlessness on behalf of these agencies is just extreme.”

Beyond providing employers with resources, UFW has taken legal action against the DHS, which Strater said has helped reduce the number of indiscriminate raids on farmworkers in certain areas of California.

Still, federal agencies can obtain criminal warrants to go after workers at specific sites, according to Strater.

Not all farm owners are taking action in response to workplace raids, but Strater said that most, including nonunionized operations, have been receptive to UFW’s recommendations. Some have even hosted community meetings to develop plans that could lessen the impact of immigration enforcement on workers and, by extension, the businesses that employ them, some of which have been hit by labor shortages triggered by the raids.

The Factory Floor

Many clothing manufacturing businesses in Los Angeles have also been open to outreach aimed at protecting employees, according to Daisy Gonzalez, campaign director at the Garment Worker Center.

“It’s a new sort of reaction to us … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said. “But I think information about what to do in this moment, employers understand it’s a resource for both their workers and themselves.”

Since the high-profile raids in June, many of the Garment Worker Center’s members have been worried about being detained on the job. Some have opted to stay home from work — for months.

In response, Gonzalez said, the Garment Worker Center has significantly ramped up its mutual aid programs, providing financial assistance to affected employees and even delivering resources to home-bound workers.

One middle-aged undocumented worker in Los Angeles, who spoke to Capital & Main on the condition of anonymity for fear that immigration officials would detain him, said the garment factory where he was working closed permanently after immigration raids began. If it were not for the Garment Worker Center’s financial support, he added, he would not have been able to pay for food or rent.

“The raids have deeply affected me, both psychologically and economically,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “There’s panic in the streets. I try to leave the house as infrequently as I can. I speak for myself, but there are thousands of people just like me, many in worse situations…this is a national emergency.”

Undocumented immigrants aren’t the only ones potentially impacted by raids.

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that DHS officers could detain people based on their race, their use of Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence at locations such as car washes, agricultural or day labor sites.

The result is that many immigrants with residency, U.S. citizens and their American-born children can get caught up in aggressive raids. To Gonzalez, “Anyone who has a darker skin tone, or speaks a different language, or works in an industry that might be where certain people expect undocumented immigrants to work, are all targets.”

Serve and Protect

On a busy street in L.A.’s Los Feliz neighborhood, customers line up to order tacos and burritos outside of a small hut. Yuca’s is a modest operation with no inside seating, but it has been in business for nearly half a century, becoming a staple of the city’s Mexican-food scene and even winning a prestigious James Beard Foundation Award.

Dora Herrera, the restaurant’s co-owner, delights in being able to serve her local community, but since the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration raids began, she has worried intensely about Yuca’s customers, vendors and workers, whom she considers “family.”

Herrera sought advice from organizations like the Latino Restaurant Association about how to protect her staff, regardless of their immigration status, as she has seen reports of federal agents arresting U.S. citizens, green-card holders and immigrants with work permits.

She has provided her employees with Know Your Rights materials like red cards and, for the first time since the restaurant opened in 1976, installed signs on the outside of the building declaring it private property. The law requires officers to produce a warrant to gain access to private property.

“We haven’t been around for 50 years for nothing. You learn something, you adapt, and you keep adapting to make it work,” Herrera said.

Such measures are far from foolproof but, according to Herrera, it is incumbent on people like her to do what they can to keep vulnerable workers as safe as possible.

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

But McHenry County Assistant State’s Attorney Troy Owens, who manages civil litigation for the county, said the lawsuit against the county should be dismissed.

McHenry County has filed suit against ICE, trying to get the federal government to pay for potential liability for allegedly making immigrant detainees do forced labor.

The court battle pits conservative McHenry County, which once fought in court for the ability to hold accused immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission in its jail, against the agency that once paid it millions of dollars every year to do so. Both county and federal officials have denied liability.

The case comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether private prisons can immediately appeal their claim of immunity against a rash of similar lawsuits across the nation.

Northwestern University professor Jacqueline Stevens, founding director of the Deportation Research Clinic at the Buffett Institute for Global Affairs, said the Supreme Court seemed skeptical of Geo Group’s claims regarding a prison it runs in Colorado. That might not bode well for a public jail like McHenry County as well.

But McHenry County Assistant State’s Attorney Troy Owens, who manages civil litigation for the county, said the lawsuit against the county should be dismissed.

“This is an absurd lawsuit,” Owens said. “The Trafficking Victims Protection Act is being grotesquely misused.”

County attorneys have argued in court that the courts have established housekeeping duties as an exception to the 13th Amendment prohibition against slavery. Prosecutors also argue that the county is immune from such lawsuits because no court has found that a government-run detention facility violates the law by requiring detainees to perform housekeeping.

“It’s not asking too much to ask them to clean up their cells and common areas,” Owens said.

About a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed nationwide, including in Colorado, Georgia and New York, against ICE and its contractors, such as CoreCivic and the GEO Group, which run private prisons. Geo Group reported revenue of $2.4 billion last year, 41% of it from ICE contracts.

The suits generally claim that inmates were forced to clean, do maintenance and perform kitchen duties for little or no pay, in violation of minimum wage laws or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

The Supreme Court recently took GEO Group’s case, in which it claims it should have “derivative sovereign immunity,” similar to immunity that protects the government from certain liability, because it had a contract to work for the government.

The McHenry County state’s attorney’s office also is arguing that ICE, acting through its contractor, The Nakamoto Group, should cover any liability in the case because the jail was merely following ICE guidelines.

While the McHenry case, filed in 2022, remains in the early stage of gathering evidence to determine its scope, other such cases have involved millions of dollars. In Tacoma, Washington, a jury awarded plaintiffs $17 million in back wages, and GEO was ordered to pay the state nearly $6 million in unfair compensation, known as unjust enrichment. They pay detainees as little as $1 a day for duties that could otherwise be done at normal wages by public workers or private employees.

“My takeaway is that the kind of get-rich schemes some entities might have through mass detention might not work out as well as they planned,” Stevens said.

McHenry County’s detention of noncitizens for ICE while their cases were decided had been a point of contention for years. Activists had pressured the county to stop the practice, but the county board voted in 2021 to continue, saying it generated revenue and kept detainees closer to home. ICE paid the county $95 per day per detainee, for an average of 240 inmates a day from 2016 to 2021, which the suit stated generated more than $41 million.

But effective in 2021, Illinois lawmakers prohibited detention contracts with local authorities. McHenry County appealed in court but lost. Since then immigrant detainees have been held in facilities out of state or at the ICE processing facility in west suburban Broadview, where federal immigration agents recently clashed with protesters over its arrests of hundreds of immigrants during the Trump administration’s Operation Midway Blitz.

In 2022, six detainees filed suit against McHenry, claiming they were forced to clean and maintain the jail without pay or face discipline. Some of the plaintiffs were released, while others returned to the countries they left. While convicted felons can be forced to do work as part of their punishment, immigrant civil detainees waiting for a hearing cannot. McHenry officials said detainees weren’t forced to work, but were responsible for keeping their own cells and day areas clean.

Ultimately, the courts must decide whether entities operating under the direction of the federal government receive governmental immunity from litigation, or whether the federal government assumes liability.

McHenry County officials declined to comment on the litigation, but told the Tribune that before the state prohibited its ICE contract, it was receiving nearly $10 million a year for housing ICE detainees. While the county has temporarily contracted with neighboring counties to house their inmates, the agreements generate about half as much revenue as the ICE contract.

The Trump administration’s solicitor general argued in the Supreme Court case that if an agency delegates authority to perform an unlawful action, the contractor is still liable. The administration has also requested a record $45 billion over the next two years to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 people, much of it through private prisons, which are prohibited in Illinois.

In other words, Stevens said, if ICE misinterprets laws Congress passes, its contractors are not immune from lawsuits.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-detained-immigrants.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-29 10:57:19.472945

But it's placed a huge bet that thousands of local cops can help.

Why it matters: ICE has signed 1,100+ agreements this year for local law enforcement to cooperate on immigration arrests and detentions. The agency is dangling financial incentives from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

The big picture: Almost 650 counties across the country are now covered by some form of the 287(g) agreement, a formal partnership between ICE and non-federal law enforcement, including sheriff's offices and state police, according to the latest data.

The surge in agreements is fueled by red states and new state laws mandating cooperation.

The Homeland Security Department recently announced that these local partners will also start aiding with vetting sponsors of migrant children with whom the Biden administration lost contact.

Zoom in: As of October, ICE is offering to reimburse for ""each eligible trained 287(g) officer"" their full salary, benefits and 25% of overtime pay.

There's also a merit-based bonus to the agencies based on ""successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance."" The highest tier pays out $1,000.

Between the lines: There are three types of 287(g) agreements, named after a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as Axios wrote in June.

For agencies to identify and process immigrants subject to removal from the country following arrests.

For ICE to train and authorize law enforcement to serve and execute immigration warrants in jails.

For local agencies to enforce immigration laws in the community. It was phased out by the Obama administration and renewed by Trump.

Zoom out: ICE has been struggling to meet its hiring goals — aiming for 10,000 new agents — as new recruits fail the fitness assessments and immigration law tests.

The partnerships with already-trained local law enforcement have quickly brought more staff onto the immigration mission.

""ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country,"" ICE's deputy director Madison Sheehan said in a statement.

The intrigue: Taxpayers in Maricopa County, Arizona are still footing the bill from a 2013 verdict that found Sheriff Joe Arpaio was racially profiling Latinos under a 287(g) agreement.

Community organizers have, in isolated cases, successfully pushed back against these agreements, including the ouster of a Bucks County sheriff over the issue in an election this November.

""Really the local cost is a huge issue,"" said Christine Sauve, of Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, who helped organize a successful pullback of two agreements in Michigan.

When residents first heard about the agreements, ""there was a real fear that their local police officers would become agents of a lawless immigration enforcement system,"" she added.

The bottom line: Florida has signed the most agreements at 337, as of Nov. 24, followed by Texas's 231.

Both states signed laws this year to require broad participation.

In nearly all of the examples Judge Ellis cited in her 200-plus page opinion, she says the Department of Homeland Security narrative contradicts the reality of what can be seen on agents' body-worn cameras.

The following are just a few examples from her ruling.

On September 26 outside of the Broadview ICE facility, video from an agent's body-worn camera shows a line of agents standing at least 30 feet away from protesters. Despite this distance, the agents start yelling ""move back, move back"" to the protesters and then shoot pepper balls and tear gas at them, all without any apparent justification, according to Judge Sara Ellis's 233-page opinion.

She said an agent wrote in his use of force report about this incident that protesters were ""becoming increasingly hostile."" However, Judge Ellis wrote in her opinion the video shows protesters were simply standing there when agents first deployed any force.

On October 4 in Brighton Park, footage shows an agent pushing a protestor to the ground. Then, tear gas and pepper balls are released. Judge Ellis wrote that only after tear gas, pepper balls and a protester was pushed to the ground by agents did protesters throw items, which ""does not support agents' use of force.""

In an incident the ABC 7 I-Team covered in Albany Park on October 12, Judge Ellis wrote that agents said in reports, and DHS publicized, that a bicyclist threw a bike at agents. But in a video, provided with no sound to start, she says it ""makes clear"" that agents first throw tear gas, then take a protester's bike throwing it and multiple other protesters to the ground after deploying tear gas.

Ellis also noted an agent is seen in redacted and blurred video from his body-worn camera in at least one instance using ChatGPT to write a use of force report, saying ""to the extent that agents use ChatGPT to create their use of force reports, this further undermines their credibility..."" Judge Ellis went on to say ""...it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendants represent.""

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Judge Ellis's initial order while the Trump administration's appeal is heard.

A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.
Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump threatened a slew of aggressive actions to curtail legal migration to the U.S. in response to one National Guard member dying after being ambushed near the White House, though the scope of those moves and what legal or congressional mechanisms he may pursue remain unclear.

Trump, who has amplified his anti-immigration rhetoric in the wake of the shooting attack by an Afghan national, said late Thursday he would permanently pause migration from “all Third World Countries,” “terminate” what he called “illegal admissions” under former President Joe Biden and end federal benefits for noncitizens. The president also said he would deport foreign nationals deemed a security risk and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

The comments signal a renewed effort to sharply curtail even legal migration to the U.S. and scale up deportations of those already in the country. Trump’s administration, however, remained largely silent Friday on how any of those changes would be made, which countries would be targeted or how sweeping the actions could be – for instance, whether the president aims to deport significant numbers of people with legal status or even citizenship by denaturalizing them, as he put it.

On Friday, Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said in a social media post that the U.S. is halting all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The agency earlier announced it would review green cards of people from “countries of concern,” potentially widening efforts to remove legal permanent residents. Those countries are the 19 listed in a travel ban from earlier this year but whether the “third world” nations Trump cited match that list is not clear.

The travel ban imposed in June restricted travel by foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S., citing the need to counter the threat of terrorist attacks and safeguard the public. Those countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Another seven countries faced partial restrictions.

Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with U.S. forces and the CIA before arriving in the U.S. in 2021, intensifying scrutiny on the more than 190,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Most of those comprise people who assisted U.S. forces during the war and their families.

Since the shooting, the president has claimed Afghan evacuees received no vetting, waving a photo of one departure flight while speaking to the media Thursday. He’s also said Lakanwal simply “went cuckoo” even as the investigation into the gunman’s motives continues.

While the Trump administration has cast blame on the Biden team, Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit group, and would have undergone vetting, including for his work alongside U.S. forces fighting the Taliban. Advocacy groups have called on Lakanwal to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and without his case negatively affecting other Afghans in the U.S.

Even before this week’s shooting, the administration aggressively moved to slash legal migration or travel to the U.S., offering some insight into their priorities. Trump has dramatically lowered the refugee cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by high-skilled workers and revoked thousands of visas.

The administration is also planning to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden.

“If you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country,” top Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News Wednesday.

The June travel ban reinstated one of the most controversial measures from Trump’s first term, which went through numerous iterations and a protracted court fight before ultimately being upheld by the Supreme Court as “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.”

Trump said the latest ban protects the nation from terrorist attacks and public safety threats. The administration has said the 12 countries on the new list facing full bans were chosen because they pose a “very high” terrorism or national security risk to the U.S. and had deficient screening and vetting processes. The seven countries where travelers face a partial ban were chosen because they posed a “high” risk.

Officials over the holiday weekend sought to quickly signal they were acting on Trump’s threats, adding to confusion over what new steps the administration was taking.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said his department would issue regulations clarifying that refunds for certain income tax benefits were “no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens,” a plan the agency already announced the previous week, before the shooting.

Trump on Thursday night also called for “reverse migration,” but without detailing what that would entail.

Any new immigration moves by the president are likely to draw legal challenges.

The administration is already facing claims it is removing migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections. Multiple lawsuits in federal court allege wrongful deportation, including a transgender woman sent to Mexico despite an immigration judge’s order blocking the move because of her risk of being tortured or killed, and the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant from El Salvador who sued to challenge his mistaken deportation to his home country.

The Justice Department has admitted authorities made mistakes in several deportation cases, which could hinder future removal attempts. A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful. An analysis from Noah Feldman of Just Security data on immigration cases found “44 involve executive actions that have been blocked by the courts; 92 have been temporarily blocked, and 29 have been blocked pending appeal.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-11-29 16:57:06.155421

During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335.
This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.
“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.","Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically bolster the US economy and commit crimes at far lower rates than people born in the US.

On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in a broad and vicious invective, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.

The president’s post follows a deadly shooting in Washington DC on Wednesday in which one National Guard member was injured and another killed by a 29-year old Afghan national who assisted the US military effort in Afghanistan and was evacuated to the US after the American military withdrew.

The shooting has sparked even more anti-immigration rhetoric from Trump’s administration, which has indicated it will further intensify its crackdown on immigrant communities - already a focal point of fierce opposition from civil rights groups, Democratic lawmakers and the public.

Since the shooting took place, Trump has vowed to conduct a comprehensive review of asylum cases and green cards issued to people from certain countries.

The unprecedented post from a US president – spiteful even by Trump’s standards contradicted extensive research showing irrefutably that immigrants to the US commit fewer crimes than people born there, and have done so for more than a century.

Despite Trump’s post, in which he claims incorrectly that 53 million people in the US – “most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels” – are contributing to “high crime”, economists have found that the immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated compared to individuals born in the US. This trend has remained consistent for the past 150 years.

Moreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically. According to an analysis by the American Immigration Council (AIC), the immigrant share of the US population has more than doubled since 1980, rising from 6.2% in that year to 13.9% in 2022. During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335. This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.

In his post, Trump also claimed that immigrants and their children “are supported through massive payments from patriotic American citizens who … put up with what has happened to our country, but it’s eating them alive to do so”.

“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.

His claim is flatly contradicted by data showing that immigrants are significant contributors to the US economy. In 2023, undocumented immigrant households contributed $89.8bn in federal, state and local taxes, while holding $299bn in spending power, according to the AIC.

The organization also found that the vast majority of immigrants are not dependent on state governments to guarantee housing. Instead, in 2023, immigrant households paid more than $167bn in rent in the housing market and held over $6.6tn in housing wealth.

Trump, who also asserted that “this refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America”, singled out with particular malice what he described as “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia [who] are taking over the once great state of Minnesota”.

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey,’” the US president said.

He added, with open racism, that Ilhan Omar – a member of Congress from Minnesota – was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab” and suggested she had married her brother.

Home to the largest Somali population in the US, many of whom arrived as refugees fleeing famine and civil war, Minnesota was labelled a “sanctuary jurisdiction” by the justice department in August . According to the department, this designation applies to states, cities or counties with laws that “hinder the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.

Trump has previously accused immigrants of “poisoning the blood of our country”, but despite repeatedly claiming that his immigration raids are targeting criminals across the country, a new study from the Cato Institute found that 73% of people detained by ICE have no convictions.

It also found that nearly half had no criminal conviction nor even any pending criminal charges and that only 5% had a violent criminal conviction.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44a49cbed72353a210739d4c2d98273a2b44a96/62_0_4298_3438/master/4298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edea911811e5d76982f3ded219ab51e8",N,,2025-11-29 08:56:44.630304

""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions.","Advocates for refugees in the United States continued to raise alarm Friday after President Donald Trump moved quickly to exploit the murder of one National Guard soldier and the wounding of another—allegedly shot by a national from Afghanistan who worked for the US military and CIA during the war there before seeking asylum in the US—by issuing a sweeping ban against asylum-seekers and halting all immigration from what he termed ""all Third World countries"" in response to Wednesday's shooting in Washington, DC.

“Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status,"" said Matthew Soerens, a vice president with the faith-based World Relief, speaking with the Associated Press, ""we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”

Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the US during the war in Afghanistan, explained to the AP that many people in the Afghan refugee community that he knows are terrified by the tone which has been set by Trump after the shooting, afraid to leave their homes for fear of being snatched up by federal agents or otherwise targeted.

“They’re terrified. It’s insane,” VanDiver told AP. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans. He represents himself.”

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual."" —Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan

On Thursday, it was announced that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, deployed with the National Guard under orders from Trump, had died from her injuries while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained in critical condition in a local hospital.

While heartbreak and mourning were widely shared for the victims of the shooting, Trump's xenophobic response to the violent assault, including his racist social media posts on Truth Social that critics said echoed white nationalist rhetoric, proved, for many observers, once again his shortcomings as a national leader during times of crisis, but also as a human being.

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual,"" said Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, on Thursday. ""That would be terribly unjust and complete nonsense. Cool heads must prevail.""

Arash Azizzada, co-director of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow, which long-opposed the US war in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 and continues to advocate on behalf of the Afghan-American community, condemned Trump for ""using this tragedy as a pretext to demonize, criminalize, and target an entire community. Exploiting a single incident to cast suspicion on Afghans—people who have already endured decades of displacement and America's forever wars—is both irresponsible and cruel.""

Azizzada also pointed out how the alleged gunman now in police custody, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, ""worked alongside US Special Operations forces and served in a CIA-backed covert paramilitary group known as 'Zero Units' that functioned outside the purview of any accountability and has a documented history of widespread human rights abuses against Afghan civilians over two decades.""

""We both condemn the violence by one individual on the streets of Washington, DC, as well as the violence perpetrated by the US in Afghanistan and elsewhere,"" said Azizzada. ""America must confront the decades of violence it inflicted on Afghanistan and acknowledge that its forever wars are a major reason why Afghans seek safety here. Blaming refugees for the consequences of those actions is unjust, and we call for the promises to Afghans to be honored, not abandoned.""

Journalist Ryan Grim, co-founder of Drop Site News, put it this way: ""The idea that we should freeze all migration because one of the CIA’s death squad recruits went on a rampage is absurd. Smarter would be to stop training death squads.""

Evacuate Our Allies, a group that advocates on behalf of Afghans who helped the US during the war and now seeking to resettle, expressed deep sympathies for the victims of the shooting and their families and condemned the ""reprehensible attack."" The group also denounced the ""alarming vilification of an entire community based on the actions of a lone individual.""

""No community, Afghan or otherwise, should be judged, demonized, or collectively punished for the behavior of one person,"" the group said. ""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions. Collective blame is not only unjust but dangerous.

Obtaining court transcripts can cost thousands of dollars for a single day of proceedings, but the documents can contain errors, missing text, and even wrong attribution, frustrating legal practitioners who say the flaws impede justice.

Justice is being obstructed by inaccurate court transcripts — including some where potentially prejudicial comments by judges were missing, according to a slew of legal practitioners interviewed by the ABC.

The prohibitive cost of obtaining transcripts also meant some appeals were not even being considered, lawyers warned.

There are now calls for change, including the cancellation of a lucrative contract with the foreign company that provides the transcripts, and for the raw audio files to be provided to litigants as a matter of course.

The ABC spoke to nine legal practitioners for this story but four declined to go on the record — some saying they feared that speaking out could lead to reprisals from judges in ongoing or subsequent court cases.

Four practitioners said erroneous transcripts in cases they had worked on affected how their cases progressed.

Some said inappropriate or biased comments from the judge were missing from the transcript, making it impossible to lodge an appeal on those grounds.

Transcripts seen by the ABC attributed dialogue to the wrong person, named the wrong legal practitioners, contained an abundance of typographical errors, and one transcript had more than two hours of proceedings missing entirely.

The court later included the missing hours of dialogue, which totalled 29 pages, after a parent in the matter raised it with the judge's associate.

According to the parent, more than one transcript in their case contained errors, forcing them to repeatedly raise it with the court, and ultimately, hindering their case.

Family law barrister Brian Kelly said in his 18 years of practice he had worked on several matters where he believed the court transcripts were wrong.

""There have been times I have reviewed transcripts I have ordered and found that they did not line up with my recollection or my notes,"" he said.

""During an interim hearing some time ago the judge made comments that I felt demonstrated an error.

""I found that the relevant section [of the transcript] I required to base an appeal on was missing.

""Without going around the loop of having the transcript reviewed, for which the client had no funds … the appeal prospects dropped markedly.""

Mr Kelly said he decided not to make a formal complaint to the court or the Attorney General. Colleagues who experienced similar issues told him they were ""hesitant to make a formal complaint because of retribution"".

""Colleagues have told me they've been aware of transcripts that haven't lined up with what they thought was in there or what their notes have said, and they haven't made any complaints either because often you have to worry about the repercussions on your client and also on the lawyers themselves,"" he said.

""If a case is still ongoing and someone has challenged the veracity of a transcript and made a complaint about it, there might be repercussions in how that case continues.""

Former New South Wales Court of Appeals judge and chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, Anthony Whealy KC, said the issue threatened to undermine the administration of justice.

""If there's an example of a judge deliberately arranging to omit material in some form of self-preservation, then I think I would describe it as an unpardonable breach. It's totally contrary to the oath the judge takes and it's absolutely contrary to every principle of judicial correctness, and to me, deplorable,"" he said.

""If there are errors and omissions then the whole system is threatened and undermined and you could encounter a serious flaw in the administration of justice.""

'I'm deeply troubled'

If the contents of a transcript are disputed, a request can be made to review it against the audio file, but recordings ""are only available in exceptional circumstances"", according to the Federal Circuit and Family Court (FCFC) website.

The court uses a transcription company called VIQ Solutions — a prominent agency that provides services to hundreds of bodies around the world including media outlets, law enforcement, government agencies and insurance companies, according to its website.

VIQ Solutions also provides transcripts for the family court in the United Kingdom, where similar concerns have been raised regarding the quality and accuracy of transcripts.

UK family law barrister Charlotte Proudman said in order for justice to be done, and to address inaccuracies, courts must allow access to audio files of proceedings — not just written transcripts.

""It is absolutely imperative that transcripts and the audio of court hearings are made available to the parties in proceedings … and I do not think there is any legal justification for refusing parties having access to effectively their own data,"" Dr Proudman said.

""To deny them the opportunity to receive that audio, I would say is hindering justice.

The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) highlighted the call for access to audio files as part of their 2021 report into judicial impartiality.

It stated, ""stakeholders suggested that transcripts often do not pick up the subtle ways in which bias can manifest in the courtroom. For example, the transcript does not pick up facial expressions, long pauses, inflexion, or tone"".

Dr Proudman agreed, saying without the audio it was difficult for parties in a family law matter to prove if a judge had ""crossed the line"".

""You need the audio in order to understand the tone as well as the volume, the way that it's said. We know that things can be said in a very sarcastic way,"" she said.

""I had a case recently where a mother on the transcript was saying to the judge, 'I just don't think you understand coercive and controlling behaviour' … and she said he was getting quite irate and his volume was raised … she said, 'you're not letting me finish, you're cutting me off. I can see from your facial expression you're not happy'.

""He was saying, 'I'm not cutting you off, I'm not raising my voice', so batted it back. So, without the audio there is no objective, neutral or impartial observer to be able to decide whether in fact he had crossed the line to a perception of bias.""

In a matter in the family court of Australia in 2020, the appeal court relied on the audio files in a case where the primary judge's conduct was found to be ""cruel, insulting, humiliating and rude"".

""Having listened to the audio version of the transcript we are struck by the stark difference in the primary judge's tone and terms of address,"" the appeal judges stated.

The appeal court found the conduct of the judge warranted a retrial on the grounds of apprehended bias ""lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined"".

Mr Whealy said while appeal courts relied almost entirely on transcripts, audio files allowed a better understanding of the ""atmosphere"" of the courtroom.

""The audio file will … give you a much better picture of the whole atmosphere of the courtroom, you know, was the judge shouting at one of the witnesses? What may appear on paper to be just a quite banal comment might sound very different when listened to in real life.""

Why is it so hard to access audio files?

Legal practitioners told the ABC the process of seeking a review of the transcript against the audio file was too complicated, too costly for litigants, and requests to access the audio files were rarely granted.

The ABC is aware of a case in which a self-represented parent requested that transcripts be reviewed due to alleged inaccuracies but was denied.

The parent claimed the judge had repeatedly yelled at and spoken over the top of them.

One of the transcripts showed the judge threatened to ""strike out the proceedings"" when the parent raised issues of procedural fairness in what was a complex and long-running case.

An ABC journalist in the court room on one of the days this matter was heard witnessed very tense interactions between the judge and the parent which included raised voices, interruptions, speaking over, and allegations of eye rolling.

During the course of the proceedings the parent applied for the judge's recusal on the basis of bias but the application to have the case heard by another judge was refused.

""Transcripts are the backbone of accountability in any legal matter. They capture the truth of what occurred in court and are vital for ensuring fairness, especially in appeals and recusal applications,"" the parent said.

""In my case, being denied access to both the transcripts and the audio recordings took away my ability as a self-represented litigant, to present my case effectively or fairly.

""It denied me the ability to properly challenge judicial conduct. The weight of that injustice is something I carry every day, with no avenue for recourse and no means to restore what was lost both legally, and for myself and my child.""

Calls for judicial commission to 'protect the courts' reputation'

In 2021, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the establishment of a federal judicial commission as part of its report into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"".

The commission would be an independent body that could examine complaints about the court system and the judiciary, similar to what already exists in some states and territories.

The federal attorney general agreed in principle to setting up the commission, but so far no action has been taken. The attorney general's department told the ABC it ""remains under consideration"".

That's not good enough, according to Greens Senator David Shoebridge, who sits on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

""It's been three years now since the ALRC made the recommendation. Three years on and we haven't even seen a consultation paper or a draft bill from the federal government. Pretty much every state and territory have a judicial commission,"" he said.

""At the end of the day a judicial commission is not only good for members of the public or lawyers who have complaints, it's good for judges too because matters get resolved, unmeritorious complaints get dealt with, and the courts are able to protect their reputation.""

Mr Whealy agreed.

""It's not just a matter for the courts. It's a matter for the community who are exposed to the processes of the courts and the administration of justice. Every member of the community wants to make sure that there are no miscarriages of justice occurring in the court system,"" he said.

The price of justice

A transcript for a single day of family court proceedings can set a parent back anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000 depending on the length of proceedings and deadline for turnaround.

The exorbitant cost has been a topic of contention for some time, with several government inquiries calling for change.

The Law Council of Australia highlighted the cost of transcripts as a barrier to justice in a 2018 report called the ""Justice Project"" — which included input from legal centres around the country.

""Exemption categories and court discretion to grant [fee] exemptions should also be reviewed and broadened in certain jurisdictions,"" the report stated.

In 2021, the ALRC's inquiry into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"" stated:

""Consideration should be given by courts to amendments to their rules and commercial arrangements that would enable greater — and more affordable — access to transcripts or recordings.""

The report also stated easier access to audio recordings should be considered, especially in cases where issues of bias had been raised.

Four years later, transcript fees are still ""absolutely ludicrous"", according to Hayder Shkara, the director of Justice Family Lawyers — a national network of 12 legal practices.

He said the cost of court transcripts was ""prohibitive"".

""It's a complete monopoly, which is also very concerning. Why is it dominated by one company? It's completely unfair,"" he said.

Mr Shkara said the court needed to catch up with advances in technology which would allow for ease and speed of transcription as well as verification.

""You would think with the improvements of technology, the workflows, streamlining different things, AI for goodness sake, all of these things have come out in the last 10 years and there has not been a decrease in costs,"" he said.

""These are everyday people [in court] who have low budgets.""

Mr Kelly agreed, saying the cost of transcripts was ""scandalous"".

""How can [the cost] be justified? It locks people out of their appeal rights.

""I have advised many people that they shouldn't proceed because they can't afford to pay for the transcripts. It makes consideration of an appeal very difficult. So people have to accept a decision that they believe is wrong.""

VIQ Solutions Australia Pty Ltd is a private subsidiary of VIQ Solutions, which is a public company based in Ontario. The parent company made a gross profit of $US19.2 million in 2024.

Mr Shoebridge said the optics of a foreign entity making profits from Australian family court proceedings was concerning.

""When you privatise essential public services like transcriptions in courts you create a lot of awkward incentives because obviously if this is a company that has a contract with the courts they don't want to get the courts offside.""

How are transcripts managed?

Transcripts are meant to be a true and correct record of court proceedings.

Any significant edits or changes to transcripts should occur with the knowledge and consent of all parties.

A spokesperson for the family court said: ""All equipment used to record hearings is owned and managed by VIQ Solutions, and no court staff member has access to the equipment, nor do staff members or judicial officers directly edit or alter transcripts"".

Upon further questioning, the spokesperson later clarified that ""court staff can correct typographical errors"" in transcripts.

However, in documents obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information (FOI) it was clear transcripts could be edited and altered at the discretion of judicial officers.

The court's ""Transcript Style Guide"" states ""a presiding judicial officer may direct that scandalous or otherwise objectionable remarks in a proceeding not be recorded in the transcript"".

The document also states that editing can occur to make the transcripts more ""readable"" including the removal of ""matters of no substance to the case"" as well as ""administrative"" matters.

Mr Kelly said it was important that judicial officers had the ability to edit transcripts, but it should be done in an open and transparent way.

""I recall times where a judge has said, 'look I'll have that removed from the transcript' if something scandalous has been said. And that should happen…but it's the controversial things where somebody is alleging something was or wasn't there or is slightly different.""

The documents released to the ABC under FOI also revealed that transcripts were sent to the court in an editable word format and that audio files were accessible by judges, registrars, judges associates and ""other authorised staff"".

Judges can retrieve and play back audio from the audio portal of any recorded proceeding from within 30 minutes of the dialogue being spoken.

The court can also request VIQ Solutions staff ""reproduce a transcript that does not accurately reflect the underlying recording"".

The contract between VIQ Solutions and the court states that VIQ must provide access to their premises, records and information and that the court can copy relevant documentation.

All ownership of the recordings and the transcripts are held by the court ""from the date of creation"", according to the contract.

Each month VIQ must provide the court with a quality report detailing any complaints made about the transcription service or audio recordings, the number of errors in transcripts and any instances where a non-authorised person has listened to a recording, according to the Statement of Requirements.

However, a court spokesperson told the ABC they could not provide any data about complaints associated with transcripts.

Documents released under FOI revealed the court set a target of no more than one error per 100 words and it conducted performance tracking on individual transcribers.

What about other jurisdictions?

In 2022, the Court of Appeal found a trial judge in a matter in the ACT Supreme Court unilaterally edited a transcript without the knowledge of the parties.

Loading...

The court found the judge had, ""listened to the audio recording … for the purpose of revising the trial transcript … without first inviting the parties' submissions not only as to the revision, but as to the consequences of the revision"".

The appeal on the basis of apprehended bias was successful, but the judgment made no mention of consequences for the judge's actions.

The ACT courts use a company called EPIQ Transcription Services to produce documents in that jurisdiction.

In May, a Federal Court judge raised concerns about the quality of transcripts in a matter between Ergon Energy Queensland and the Australian Energy Regulator.

Justice Cameron Moore stated:

""the preparation of this judgment has been hampered by the extremely poor quality of the transcript of the proceedings, which has not managed to record in any accurate way the exchanges in the course of oral submissions that elucidated the parties' positions on construction.""

The Federal Court also uses VIQ Solutions. The Federal Court did not answer the ABC's questions about how the transcript had become corrupted but a spokesperson said the court was working with VIQ Solutions to address ""inefficiencies"".

""On this occasion, the transcript was not of an acceptable quality. We take all issues relating to transcript quality and delivery seriously,"" a spokesperson said.

The ABC put detailed questions to VIQ Solutions about how the transcription service operated, what processes were in place to address errors and who had access to audio files and transcripts.

The attorney general's department said any issues were a matter for the courts.

""The federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management, and for making rules of court. This includes responsibility for transcription services and associated contractual arrangements,"" a spokesperson said.

Mr Whealy said it was the attorney general's responsibility to address any concerns regarding the legal system.

""The attorney general, as the first law officer, has the obligation to face up to problems that are there and to help solve them with the cooperation of the courts,"" he said.

""There's been a call for many years now for there to be a federal judicial commission. We don't have one and it defies description or any rational explanation as to why that should be so.""

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.","Federal immigration officials are reexamining green cards issued to people from 19 countries considered “high-risk” at President Donald Trump’s direction.

The decision, announced Nov. 27 by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, comes in light of the deadly shooting of two National Guard members by a suspected gunman who is an Afghan national.

“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said on X.

USCIS said it issued new guidance for “negative, country specific factors” to be considered when vetting people from 19 countries.

In other words, the government could try to remove legal status of people with green cards from those countries for reasons related to their country of origin rather than anything they personally have done.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said the agency guidance appears ambiguous on how it will make those determinations other than that USCIS officials is getting more discretion.

While details are forthcoming, and legal challenges are likely, here’s what to know on the guidance.

Which countries are included?

The new guidance applies to immigrants from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

These countries were previously listed in Trump’s June 4 proclamation seeking to restrict entry of people from them.

The Trump administration had previously halted Afghan refugee settlement and travel on the president’s first day in office, according to Tricia McLaughlin, secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The new USCIS announcement referred to “the status of those *previously* brought into the U.S.,” she said in an X post, meaning those already here would face additional scrutiny.

When does the policy go into effect?

USCIS’ Policy Alert says it took effect immediately.

How is the Trump administration conducting this review?

The changes appear to now take a harder look at people's origin countries to justify removal from the United States.

Trump’s past proclamation, cited by the USCIS guidance, included considering activities of terrorist groups, rates of nationalities overstaying their visas in the United States, and whether a country can issue secure identity documents.

Who’s affected?

Anyone from the affected countries who’s applying for permanent residency and anyone with existing green cards from the 19 nations.

The USCIS Policy Alert says it will consider ""relevant country-specific facts and circumstances."" It applies to people applying for certain adjustments of status, like for a green card, as well as extending stays or changing status for nonimmigrants, which is typically people in the country on a temporary basis.

What are the possible outcomes?

Officials could try to remove someone from the country.

USCIS says the change will allow its officers to better determine whether a person is a “threat to public safety and national security.”

But, Selee said, it would be difficult for the government to remove people with permanent residency status unless officials can prove to an immigration judge that they pose a national security threat. The administration has tried to remove pro-Palestinian student activists on those grounds, resulting in legal fights.

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.

This may signal that people looking at permanent residency in the future may be more affected than those already with green cards.

Is it going to face legal challenges?

Almost certainly.

USCIS based its policy on a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president powers to suspend or restrict the entry of ""all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants"" into the United States by proclamation if their entry would be detrimental to national interests.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/28/USAT/87510117007-usatgraphics-greencards.png?crop=6498,3655,x830,y433&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-29 01:56:27.612370

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said.
“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said.
“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said.
So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”","In a pair of lengthy social media posts, President Donald Trump said he’ll pause migration from “third world countries” and strip citizenship from migrants who “undermine domestic tranquility.” The president’s comments come in response to the deadly shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. by an Afghan national who was granted asylum.

Trump’s statements

The president wrote at length in the two posts about immigration in the U.S.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” Trump wrote. “As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

There is no evidence Somalians are overtaking Minnesota despite the president’s claims.

Trump’s response came after it was revealed the shooter in Washington is an Afghan national and refugee.

“One can appreciate the kind of shock and concerns that Americans have, witnessing something like that on the day before Thanksgiving, and the president responding to it,” Peter Skerry, professor of political science at Boston College, told Straight Arrow News. “As is his habit, he tends to overdramatize and make the argument too strong and in much too broad in general terms.”

Curbing immigration

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” Trump wrote.

When it comes to those statements as actual policy, there are several variables.

“They’re very vague, and it’s hard to see exactly how they would translate into national policy,” John Skrentny, sociology professor at University of California, San Diego, told SAN. “So trying to assess the legality of these moves is not the easiest thing in the world, because terms such as third world, that’s not a legal term, and it’s hard to know who’s in and who’s out of that.”

It’s not the first time Trump has used broad terms to describe foreign nations negatively including famously questioning why America would allow immigrants from “s—hole countries” during his first term.

“The American people have lots of reasons to be concerned and anxious about our immigration policies, but he pushes it to the limit, and I think that’s not very helpful,” Skerry said.

The Department of Homeland Security said they have indefinitely suspended processing immigration requests from Afghan nationals and plan to review all pending asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.

“Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests,” Joseph Edlow, USCIS director, said in a statement.

The ongoing influx of immigrants to the U.S. remains a concern for many Americans.

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said. “I think that’s the relevant point here. Congress has to step up to the plate.”

Legality

Putting a halt on immigration from numerous countries would be a difficult task and would likely be challenged by members of Congress and the court system.

It could be similar to Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” in 2017, which ended in a Supreme Court decision that allowed the ban to go through.

“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said. “One of them is called the plenary power, and that’s the idea that in the case of immigration, the executive branch and Congress can pretty much do what they want.”

The other legal doctrine Skrentny pointed to is the 14th Amendment, which guarantees people, not just citizens, the due process of law.

“Having said that the law is whatever the judges say it is,” Skrentny said. “So, a lot of folks thought that Roe v. Wade was settled law. Turns out that it wasn’t.”

The Trump administration has taken unprecedented actions on immigration, such as invoking the Alien Enemies Act earlier this year.

“One would have to be concerned that they do it in a way that follows the law and does it in a systematic and fair way,” Skerry said. “The way they’ve been going, I have real doubts about that.”

The Trump administration has not always abided by laws or court rulings.

“Judges are just people sitting behind [a desk] and they’re just making pronouncements,” Skrentny said. “They don’t have an army, they don’t have a security force, they can’t enforce their opinions. And so, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t think anyone who will tell you that they know what’s going to happen is being honest. Really, we’re in uncharted territory.”

Meanwhile, revoking people’s green cards is a possibility.

“It’s clear that green cards are revocable, have been revoked in specific instances, and they can and will do that,” Skerry said. “The question is, will they do it fairly following procedures, or do it in the kind of slipshod way that they seem to be doing most things when it comes to immigration policies.”

Stripping a person of citizenship is a much different process and can be very complex.

Impact of immigration change

The president’s immigration policies have had several implications on the country, including a reduction in the workforce, GDP loss and some have even pointed to added cost of living.

“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said. “There already are negative impacts. The president himself has acknowledged that at various points.”

Immigration is a topic that continues to divide Americans at a time where many Americans believe the country is more divided than ever.

“If everyone was getting their news from Straight Arrow News, then maybe we wouldn’t have that problem,” Skrentny said. “But that’s not the case at this time. So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247918723_Pete_MarovichGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:56:21.911167

Olivia Vivanco was born and still lives in Mexico City, but the path that led her to photograph migration, she likes to say, “arrived almost by coincidence.” In the late 1990s, while working on projects about childhood, she began visiting schools attended by the children of migrant farmworkers—families from Guerrero, Oaxaca, or Chiapas who traveled north to Nayarit or Sinaloa following the agricultural seasons. She remembers her surprise at seeing entire families working side by side: “Parents, children, siblings—all part of the same labor force.”

The topic reappeared years later, around 2012, when Central American migration dominated public attention—La Bestia, kidnappings, assaults, and the San Fernando massacre. A friend from the Jesuit Migrant Service encouraged her to volunteer at shelters, and that is how she arrived at La 72 in Tenosique, Tabasco.

“At first, I didn’t go as a photographer, but as a volunteer. But being there I realized that this space—which hardly appeared in migration narratives—was also part of the story. Until then, I had seen many images of train tracks, accidents, pain, but in the shelters I found something different: an everyday life where bonds are built, where you can chat while washing dishes or sweeping the patio. I realized that things also happened there, but from a more intimate, more human place.”

Photography entered her life early. At seventeen she tagged along with a friend to a class and was the one who stayed. A cousin later gave her an enlarger and lab equipment, and she taught herself black-and-white photography. Though she abandoned it for a time, the desire for personal, thematic projects never left. When she returned to photography, she began again from scratch—this time with purpose. She cites Lewis Hine for his ability to expose child labor and provoke real social change. But a decisive encounter was with photographer and curator Javier Ramírez Limón, who helped her understand that “formal decisions had to be at the service of the subject, not at the service of a personal style.”

Migration remained her central subject because it never stopped changing. “No year is like the previous one,” she explains. The south differs from the north; a first crossing differs from a second or a tenth. In the south she saw people already harmed by their first contact with Mexico; in the north she met travelers who had endured months of uncertainty, violence, and fear. Over time she came to realize that photography alone could not capture the entire story.

“That constant transformation has kept me interested in the topic and has also transformed my way of narrating: There were moments when I understood that photography could not contain everything, especially what is not seen —the disappearances, the waiting, the uncertainty. That’s when I started incorporating video, interviews, objects, and records of empty spaces. I am interested in speaking about migration through its silences and its material traces.”

Her encounters with migrants map out the shifts in global movement. In the early years most came from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. There were occasional Nicaraguans, Cubans, or Africans. But today the landscape is vast: Venezuelans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, Haitians—many of whom lived for years in Brazil or Chile before moving north. She recalls meeting Haitian workers who built stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and later found themselves stranded in Tijuana. In recent years she has met Ukrainians and Russians fleeing war or conscription. “Every year, nationalities become more diverse and the stories more complex.”

People share with her a wide range of reasons for leaving. “From domestic or gender violence to extortion, protection rackets, loss of property, or generalized impoverishment. There are also those who flee due to disagreement with their governments or simply because they cannot find conditions for a dignified life. There are very painful stories of people crossing the Darién and losing companions along the way; women who are assaulted; children who carry memories of scenes no child should witness. But deep down, all of these stories share the search for a better life. Yes, for economic prosperity, but mainly for peace.”

Some stories, though, remain particularly painful. “In Mexicali I met several elderly Mexican men who had been deported. They had spent most of their lives in the United States. They migrated when they were young, formed families there, had children and grandchildren, and suddenly, for a minimal infraction —sometimes a traffic violation— they were sent back to a country they no longer recognized as their own. Here they have no family ties, no access to work or social security. Age leaves them out of the labor market, and a technological gap even separates them from their loved ones.”

As Olivia explains, these are men aging in a territory that feels foreign, without support networks, without a clear future. “Many fall into depression or illness, without access to medical care. It is a silent form of uprooting. Their stories hurt me deeply because they are rarely told, but they are also migration: stories of forced return and loss of belonging.”

One of her most emotional photographs came from her series Reliquias, made at La 72. She was drawn to the tiny backpacks migrants carry, curious about the objects important enough to accompany someone across continents. She asked migrants to show her something they considered a personal treasure. Fredy, from Honduras, wanted to show her a photograph of his daughter, but discovered he had lost it. Heartbroken, he surprised her by asking to proceed anyway. “He told me to write his daughter’s name—Astrid—on his hand,” she remembers. “Even though he no longer had the image, she was still with him.”

Olivia works primarily in shelters across Mexico—Tecún Umán, Tapachula, Tenosique, Ixtepec, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Mexico City, Tijuana, Mexicali, Altar, Ciudad Juárez, Saltillo, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo. “I do not accompany migrants on their routes,” she explains. “My work happens in shelters, where they stop for hours or days and it’s possible to build bonds of trust. There, we coexist, share tasks, converse. From these spaces I have also developed a project parallel to photography: Collecting objects migrants leave behind on the road. I do this together with migrants who, based on their own experience, help validate that these objects belonged to other travelers. It is a different way of narrating transit, through the material traces left behind.”

In recent years I have also worked in improvised camps in Mexico City. Faced with the lack of shelter capacity, many people —especially Venezuelan or Haitian families— have been forced to remain on the street, in very precarious conditions, without access to basic services or safety. These places have also become part of the current migratory landscape.

“Unfortunately, many of the areas migrants travel through are also territories controlled by organized crime or networks linked to drug trafficking. In the north of the country I have had a couple of difficult experiences; situations of threat and surveillance that at one point made me reconsider the topic,” she explains.

But in those contexts, Olivia’s priority has always been collective safety. “I adhere to the recommendations of shelter coordinators, not only for my own protection but above all to avoid putting migrants at risk. Many are already fleeing violence or direct threats; the last thing I can allow is for my presence or work to worsen their vulnerability.”

Rather than learning to prepare for danger, Olivia has learned to recognize limits. “I know when it’s time to leave, and to trust those who know the terrain. Prudence and respect, I believe, are the best forms of care.”

Ethics guide everything she does.

“In my work in migrant houses, I decided years ago to avoid photographing people. This choice came from my disagreement with how the media often portrayed migrants: extremely close-up, in moments of exhaustion, hunger, or sadness. It made me uncomfortable how those representations could revictimize or even criminalize them. I thought that, if I were in such a situation —far from my country, in transit, without access to basic necessities— I wouldn’t want to be portrayed that way. That’s why I chose to speak about migration through spaces: shelters, objects, the material traces people leave as they pass. In those traces their presence is there, in a respectful way, showing without exposing.”

When conducting interviews or more personal conversations, Olivia always introduces herself and clearly explains what she is doing and why. “I ask if they want to share their name or prefer to remain anonymous, and I absolutely respect their decision. I am not interested in exposing, but in accompanying. For me, their trust is invaluable.”

Olivia is interested in making visible the spaces where migration happens “beyond the route or the train, and also other moments of migrants’ lives.” She believes documentary photography remains necessary precisely because it does something that artificial intelligence or media discourse cannot: “be present, listen, observe, and transform that experience into a visual testimony.”

Defining her work ethic, she says, “My responsibility is not to put people at risk, but rather to protect their identity, and to ensure they maintain agency within the narrative.” Olivia thinks of photography as an act of co-creation. “It is a process in which my work does not stand on its own without the collaboration of the other.”

In the case of migration, Olivia is interested in reaching as many people as possible, “broad audiences, not only specialized ones.” Her images and projects have been shared in academic spaces, civil society media and exhibitions, “but something I value especially is when the work sparks conversations, generates questions or produces shared knowledge.” As she explains, “Photography alone doesn’t tell everything; that’s why I think it’s important to also speak, to convey what migrants share with me during my stays, their vulnerabilities and their resilience.”

Oliva hopes that her images serve as a starting point for reflection about human rights, the needs of people in transit, the absence of governmental attention or institutional abandonment in the search for missing migrants. “My work is only the tip of the thread: behind every image there is a complex weave of stories, violence, resistance and hope that is not seen by those far from the topic.” Projects like MigraPalabra, a zine created with Pablo Landa and Mi Valedor, expand this purpose by centering migrants’ own voices and creativity.

“In places like Mexico City, where there are strong prejudices toward migrant camps, it is evident how media discourse often stays at the surface. There is talk of overcrowding or dirt, but rarely is it mentioned that the lack of basic services —water, toilets, minimum care— is the responsibility of the State, not of those forced to live in those conditions. I want my work to open those conversations, to allow migration to be seen from its complexity and not from misinformation or fear.”

Her projects have received a generous international reception. Reliquias has traveled across the Americas, Europe, and Africa, published widely, and awarded in Colombia and Mexico. Her work in shelters, part of the De Paso project, has appeared in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and is included in the XV IBERO Puebla Biennial of Contemporary Art 2025. Her exhibition Pausas en el Camino at the Sonora Museum of Art has resonated deeply, especially with young viewers who value seeing migration “from another perspective—places where sometimes nothing happens, or through objects that speak of everyday transit without showing people.”

She is now reviewing twelve years of work, planning a publication where her photographs dialogue with voices from architecture, literature, human rights, and shelter coordinators. She envisions a broader conversation in which images are just one thread. She is also preparing a traveling exhibition to reach new audiences.

Looking ahead, she intends to continue exploring migration, visiting shelters she has yet to know, documenting spaces with distinct challenges and dynamics. “I deeply respect all the migrants I have met; men, women, children who have left their country, their home, their family, and who have traveled dangerous routes and endured extremely harsh experiences with the hope of a better life. That decision —to leave, to try despite everything— is in itself worthy of respect.”

Olivia is also grateful for the volunteers, religious women and men, human rights defenders, “people who have made this work their way of life,” she says. “Many of them not only care for people in the shelters; they also remain attentive to their journeys, even when the people are already in other countries.”

Working in shelters has taught her valuable lessons, including the value of presence and accompaniment. “Every shelter, every migrant house, has its own dynamics and rhythms, very delicate stories and being received there is an act of generosity.” Volunteer work is very fulfilling, she says. “I believe what people most appreciate is daily accompaniment. And although I do not have professional training for emotional support, I can listen and offer time. I have learned not to impose my needs on theirs, to adapt myself, and to be there only as far as I am allowed.”

As for what transit countries must do, she is clear. “I believe they must assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the safety and free transit of migrants. They should not be harassed, assaulted or exploited. Unfortunately, in Mexico violence affects the entire population, but in the case of migrants it is often doubled, from organized crime and, many times, also from authorities. Those who should protect them —immigration institutions, police, security forces— too often become those who extort, threaten or abuse.”

As Olivia remarks, “countries have the obligation to protect all people on their territory, even temporarily. It’s not only about allowing them to pass, but ensuring that passage is safe, dignified, without violence, and with full respect for human rights. Migrants should be treated like any citizen in terms of basic rights: access to services, protection, emergency attention. Essentially, it’s about recognizing their humanity.”

Ultimately, Olivia Vivanco’s work is a sustained act of witnessing—one that listens to what migration leaves unsaid and shines light on the resilient lives crossing Mexico in search of peace.

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.
He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.
She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023.
She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia.
What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

West Virginia held a moment of silence this afternoon for the National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. One of the two has died. A second remains in critical condition. And here to give us the latest on the shooting and the investigation is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Hi, Vanessa.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.

DETROW: What do we know about the Guard member who died yesterday?

ROMO: Her name is Sarah Beckstrom. She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023. She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia. Obviously, her family is devastated by the tragedy. And in a post on Facebook, Beckstrom's father called her his baby girl and said that she had passed to glory.

Also, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey said in a statement earlier today that Beckstrom had made, quote, ""the ultimate sacrifice in service to her state and the nation."" He added that both Beckstrom and Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, the second victim who remains in critical condition, had actually stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.

DETROW: What is the latest on the investigation? What do we know about the suspect at this point?

ROMO: His name is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and he's an Afghan national. And he's himself hospitalized after the shooting. He is 29 years old, and he was just 5 when the war in Afghanistan started. He immigrated to the U.S. in 2021, when the U.S. withdrew from the country and the Taliban toppled the government there.

According to a nonprofit that works with Afghan refugees, Lakanwal actually served in an elite counterterrorism unit that was called Zero Unit that was operated by the CIA. And Human Rights Watch reports that these specialized units, which were recruited and trained by the CIA, were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions. And CIA director John Ratcliffe confirmed that it's because of the work that Lakanwal did fighting against the Taliban for the U.S. that he and his family were allowed to flee here.

And U.S. officials say he's been living with his wife and children in Bellingham, Washington. After about four years, he was granted asylum just this past April. And as far as the investigation goes, that is ongoing. Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad. And at the moment, there's no clear motive in terms of what prompted him to drive nearly 3,000 miles across the country and launch the ambush.

DETROW: And this attack is playing out in our politics already. What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?

ROMO: So the administration has already halted the processing of any immigration request from Afghan nationals. Plus, the head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joe Edlow, announced a, quote, ""full scale, rigorous reexamination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern."" In a statement, USCIS referred to 19 different countries that the administration already declared required extra vetting. A proclamation earlier this year restricted travel from immigrants and nonimmigrants to the U.S.

And we should also note that the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan on the very first day of his second term. And late last night, Trump wrote on Truth Social that, quote, ""refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America."" And then he went on to blame immigrants for crime and using federal benefits. And he called out legal green card holders for getting support. Trump also said that he's going to, quote, ""permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover."" But it's not clear if this goes further than what has already been announced, or if additional policy changes are coming.

DETROW: That is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Thank you so much for the latest.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.

Both the criminal case and the case before Judge Xinis remain pending.
As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.","Politico reported last week from the ongoing hearings in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., on the government’s attempts to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member whose removal to El Salvador in the spring triggered a national firestorm. Apparently, 30 weeks later, the judge hearing the case realized something I reported on in early April – though the implications may not be quite what she thinks they are.

The Kilmar Abrego-Garcia Saga

This case became national news on April 1, the New York Times reported: “A Maryland man who was in the United States legally was deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there because of an ‘administrative error.’”

The “Maryland man” is Abrego, a Salvadoran national alleged by both local authorities and the federal government to be a member of MS-13.

He entered illegally in March 2012, and but was only taken into custody by ICE in March 2019, based both on his illegal status and purported evidence linking him to MS-13, a violent criminal organization with its roots in Los Angeles and a significant presence in El Salvador and elsewhere.

In April 2019, an immigration judge (IJ) in Baltimore denied Abrego’s bond request, finding the evidence in the case “shows that he is a verified member of MS-13”. He appealed that bond denial, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed what it referred to as the IJ’s “danger ruling” eight months later.

While in detained removal proceedings, Abrego through counsel filed an application for asylum, “statutory withholding” of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

That application was assigned to a second IJ, who on October 10, 2019, granted Abrego’s statutory withholding application but denied his applications for asylum and CAT.

Abrego Garcia was released following that grant, but rearrested by ICE on March 12, 2025, and sent to an ICE detention facility in Texas.

Thereafter, he was removed to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador sometime around March 16 under an agreement (the terms of which are still undisclosed) the administration struck with the government of that country.

On March 24 – nine days after he arrived in El Salvador – Abrego, his wife, and child, through counsel, filed a “Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Declaratory Judgment” in federal district court in Maryland.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. That order formed the basis of DOJ’s later appeal to the Fourth Circuit, and ultimately its application to the Supreme Court.

Specifically, Judge Xinis directed the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of ... Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States by no later than 11:59 PM on Monday, April 7, 2025”.

By ordering the government to “effectuate” the return of Abrego Garcia, the judge was demanding the administration to engage in expedited diplomatic negotiations with El Salvador and requiring that those negotiations result in the return of Abrego Garcia – again, a Salvadoran citizen – to the United States before April 8.

The government asked the Fourth Circuit to stay Judge Xinis’s order, noting in its Emergency Motion: “The United States does not have control over Abrego Garcia. Or the sovereign nation of El Salvador.”

A three-judge circuit panel denied that motion on April 7, forcing DOJ to quickly file an application to vacate Judge Xinis’s order with Chief Justice John Roberts, the circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit.

The chief justice issued an administrative stay of the district court order to give the Court the chance to consider the government’s application, and on April 10, all nine justices weighed in.

The Court noted Judge Xinis’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.

Nonetheless, the justices remanded the case to Judge Xinis to “clarify” her demand that the government “effectuate” the alien’s return, “with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.

While Abrego was in El Salvador, on May 21, a grand jury in Tennessee handed down an indictment in U.S. v. Abrego Garcia, charging him with conspiracy to transport aliens under section 274(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) of the INA and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens” under section 274(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the INA.

That indictment was unsealed by order of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on June 6, the same day Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Abrego had been returned to the United States to answer those charges.

Both the criminal case and the case before Judge Xinis remain pending.

Back to the Beginning

Remember, Abrego – through counsel – was the petitioner in the Maryland case, and as such bore the burden of showing that he had been improperly removed from the United States to El Salvador.

To establish that he had been improperly removed, Abrego submitted a 14-page decision issued by the second IJ to hear his case on October 10, 2019. That was the only proof of that fact he offered, but as I explained on April 4, having read that order it appeared the IJ had granted Abrego statutory withholding to Guatemala, not El Salvador.

Notably, in the “conclusion” paragraph in that decision, the second IJ explained:

DHS has not shown that there are changed circumstances in Guatemala that would result in the Respondent’s life not being threatened, or that internal relocation is possible and reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, the Respondent’s application for withholding under the Act is granted. [Emphasis added.]

Guatemala and El Salvador are two different countries, and while no transcript of the hearings before Judge Xinis appears in the record, I assume that the attorney representing DOJ admitted that Abrego was removed from the United States due to administrative error.

Lawyers owe a duty of candor to the court, and perhaps that lawyer knew some extrinsic facts that aren’t in the record. If, however, the DOJ lawyer relied on the October 10, 2019, decision from the second IJ, that admission may have been in error.

Statutory withholding is “country-specific”, in that it prevents the government from deporting an alien granted that protection to the country or countries from which the IJ or BIA withheld removal.

In fact, the regulation governing statutory withholding, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16, states in its final subsection (f): “Nothing in this section . . . shall prevent [DHS] from removing an alien to a third country other than the country to which removal has been withheld or deferred.”

“An Immigration Court Error 6 Years Ago Could Lead to Release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”

Which brings me to the Politico article, headlined “An immigration court error 6 years ago could lead to release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”.

The article quotes Judge Xinis as stating in open court on November 20:

There is no order of removal in the docket, in the record . . .. You can’t fake it ‘til you make it. You got to have it. … You have to have the order. It’s got to be an order memorialized somewhere and I don’t have it.

The “order” Judge Xinis is apparently referring to is what’s commonly known as a “minute order”, a preprinted document the second IJ would have (or should have) issued when he issued his October 10, 2019, decision.

As I explained back on April 4:

While the judge’s memorandum of decision and order is enlightening, it conveys no legal authority in and of itself. At the time he issued it, the immigration judge should also have issued a separate preprinted form referred to as a “minute order”, which does have legal authority.

On that form, the immigration judge would have checked boxes showing he denied asylum and CAT, but granted statutory withholding, which Abrego Garcia would have needed to present to prove that he had lawful status in the United States.

That minute order, however, would also have shown that Abrego Garcia was ordered removed and listed the country to which removal was ordered but withheld. As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.

Abrego was represented by counsel in his removal proceedings before the second IJ, and if the second IJ failed to issue a minute order it was up to that lawyer to ask the court to prepare and serve one.

This isn’t a mere “paperwork” issue: Abrego needed that document to prove he was here lawfully and to apply for work authorization. He had every reason to request one, and again that minute order – not the October 10, 2019, decision – was the proof Abrego needed when he filed his complaint with Judge Xinis in March to prove the government had unlawfully removed him to El Salvador.

Faking It Until Making It

Respectfully, everybody in this case has been faking it until they can make it in this case, or nobody is. And in my opinion, nobody is; they are just a little unclear on the law.

By precedent, an order of removal was a “condition precedent”, a crucial step the second IJ was required to take before he could grant Abrego statutory withholding.

The precedent in question is the BIA’s 2008 opinion in Matter of I-S- & C-S-, where the Board held: “When an Immigration Judge issues a decision granting an alien’s application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the [INA], without a grant of asylum, the decision must include an explicit order of removal.”

It’s possible the second IJ never issued a minute order in Abrego’s case (I had plenty of other issues with his decision), but I doubt it and if there is one, it’s in his alien file (A-file) and in the immigration court Record of Proceedings (ROP) -- and it will clarify whether withholding was granted to El Salvador or Guatemala.

Somebody may want to check out Abrego’s A-file and ROP, but considering that precedent and the second IJ’s decision, I’d argue that even absent a minute order, the second IJ de jure had to have ordered Abrego removed to grant him statutory withholding, and that he granted withholding to Guatemala.

But respectfully, Judge Xinis could have spared everyone a lot of drama and court time if she had simply asked Abrego – who again bore the initial burden of proof in the case – for the minute order in his case before she did anything else.

Not that I blame her for failing to do so. Section 242 of the INA governs judicial review in immigration cases, and Congress therein largely cut district courts out of the process. Cases like this are terra incognita for most trial-level federal court judges (which is why they may want to be circumspect when they do consider them).

In April, I noted two key defects in Abrego v. Noem: an IJ decision that appeared to withhold Abrego’s removal to Guatemala, not El Salvador; and the absence in the record of a minute order, a legal document that would clarify the issue.

I’m dumbfounded that only now – after this case was considered by 13 different federal judges (one district, three circuit, and nine justices) and thousands of gallons of ink were spilled examining every aspect of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s life – has Judge Xinis identified the same issues I did 30 weeks ago. But the ultimate result may not be what she thinks it is.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/kilmar-tattoos.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 20:56:48.520538

This commentary examines the Eleventh Circuit’s unpublished per curiam decision in Richard Rose v. Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, No. 25‑11233 (11th Cir. Nov. 25, 2025), a follow‑on appeal in a high‑profile Voting Rights Act challenge to Georgia’s method of electing members of its Public Service Commission (“PSC”).

Four Black Georgia voters – Richard Rose, Brionte McCorkle, Wanda Mosley, and James Major Woodall – originally sued the Georgia Secretary of State contending that the statewide, at‑large method of electing PSC commissioners unlawfully diluted Black voting strength in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (“VRA”). After extensive litigation and a bench trial, the district court ruled in their favor and enjoined the statewide system. The Secretary appealed, and in 2023 the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the plaintiffs lacked a legally viable § 2 theory because they had not proposed a satisfactory remedial plan that met the first Gingles precondition.

Once the appellate mandate issued, the plaintiffs attempted to amend their complaint to introduce new remedial theories and thereby resurrect their § 2 claim. The district court refused to permit amendment and entered judgment for the Secretary. The plaintiffs appealed again, arguing they should be allowed to amend under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15(a), 59(e), or 60(b).

The 2025 decision analyzed here does not revisit the merits of the Voting Rights Act claim. Instead, it addresses a procedural but highly consequential question: when, if ever, may a plaintiff radically re‑plead a case – including new theories of remedy – after having fully litigated, lost on appeal, and received an adverse mandate? The Eleventh Circuit affirms the denial of leave to amend, emphasizing the district court’s broad discretion and focusing on the “undue prejudice” that a late‑stage amendment would inflict on the defendant.

Although marked “NOT FOR PUBLICATION” and therefore non‑precedential under Eleventh Circuit rules, the opinion is instructive. It reinforces several significant principles:

Leave to amend is not automatic, even under Rule 15(a)’s liberal standard.

District courts may deny post‑judgment amendments when they would cause substantial prejudice to defendants, especially after years of intensive litigation.

Plaintiffs are not entitled to a “second bite at the apple” by advancing new legal or remedial theories only after an appellate loss.

The Supreme Court’s decision in Pullman-Standard v. Swint does not require district courts to permit amendment in this posture.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Factual and Institutional Background

The Georgia PSC is a five‑member body that regulates public utilities. It is described as “quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial,” with responsibilities including:

Administering federal funds for pipeline safety,

Setting utility rates, and

Adjudicating rate disputes.

Each commissioner must reside in one of five PSC geographic districts, but commissioners are elected by a statewide, at‑large vote rather than by voters solely within their district.

The plaintiffs alleged that this system diluted Black voters’ influence statewide in violation of Section 2 of the VRA and proposed a single remedy: converting the PSC elections from statewide, at‑large elections to single‑member district elections (i.e., each district electing its own commissioner by district‑only voting).

B. The First Appeal: Failure of the § 2 Theory

In Rose v. Secretary, State of Georgia, 87 F.4th 469 (11th Cir. 2023), the Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court’s judgment for the plaintiffs. The panel held that:

A § 2 vote dilution claim is governed by the three Gingles preconditions from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986).

The first Gingles precondition – that the minority group be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a “reasonably configured district” – implies a requirement that plaintiffs “offer a satisfactory remedial plan,” citing Wright v. Sumter Cnty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, 979 F.3d 1282, 1302 (11th Cir. 2020).

The plaintiffs’ only proposed remedy was a “single, dramatic remedy—transforming a statewide voting system into a single-member districted plan,” which the court found unsatisfactory as a remedial plan under § 2.

Because the plaintiffs did not offer a legally viable remedial plan, they failed the first Gingles precondition, and thus their entire § 2 claim failed. There were no remaining, unaddressed claims or theories.

C. The Post‑Mandate Motion to Amend

The appellate mandate issued on July 18, 2024. That same day, the plaintiffs:

Requested leave in the district court to amend their complaint under Rule 15, and

Filed a proposed amended complaint challenging the same PSC election method but now offering “several new proposed remedies” that they argued would satisfy Gingles.

On July 22, the district court formally entered judgment for the Secretary by adopting the Eleventh Circuit’s mandate. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for relief from judgment under Rules 59 and 60(b), again seeking the ability to amend.

The district court rejected their effort, finding that:

The plaintiffs had unduly delayed seeking to amend,

Allowing amendment would unduly prejudice the Secretary, and

The proposed amendment would be futile.

D. Issues on Second Appeal

On the second appeal, the plaintiffs contended that they should be permitted to amend their complaint regardless of which rule governs:

Rule 15(a) (liberal amendment standard),

Rule 59(e) (altering or amending judgment), or

Rule 60(b) (relief from judgment).

The Secretary responded that the plaintiffs could not satisfy even Rule 15(a), the most lenient standard.

E. Holding

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of leave to amend. Applying an abuse‑of‑discretion standard, the panel:

Assumed without deciding that Rule 15(a) applied (the most favorable framework for plaintiffs).

Held that under Rule 15(a) the district court acted within its discretion to deny leave based on undue prejudice to the Secretary.

Rejected the plaintiffs’ reliance on Pullman-Standard v. Swint as a basis to require further proceedings or leave to amend.

The court concluded that, after “years of litigation” culminating in a complete appellate rejection of their theory, the plaintiffs could not reconfigure their case by adding new remedial theories at that late stage. The decision underscores that the district court’s interest in finality and fairness to the defendant outweighed the plaintiffs’ desire to salvage their lawsuit.

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Procedural Posture and Why It Matters

This appeal sits at the intersection of voting rights and civil procedure. Critically, the case was not at an early or mid‑litigation stage. By the time the plaintiffs sought to amend:

The complaint had been on file since July 2020;

The parties had completed extensive fact and expert discovery;

Multiple dispositive motions (including summary judgment) had been litigated;

A five‑day bench trial had taken place, with testimony from three experts and all PSC commissioners;

The district court had issued a merits ruling and a permanent injunction;

The Eleventh Circuit had reversed, holding the plaintiffs’ theory legally deficient; and

The appellate mandate had issued, leaving only entry of final judgment in favor of the Secretary.

In this procedural posture, the plaintiffs’ attempt to amend was not a routine mid‑case refinement. It was an effort to fundamentally restructure the case after full litigation and an adverse appellate decision. That context drives the court’s emphasis on prejudice, finality, and the limits of liberal amendment policy.

B. Standards for Amending Pleadings After Judgment

1. Rule 15(a): Liberal Amendment, but Not an Absolute Right

Rule 15(a)(1) permits one amendment “as a matter of course” within 21 days after service of an answer or certain motions. That period had long since expired (by 2021). Thereafter, under Rule 15(a)(2):

“a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”

However, as the Eleventh Circuit reiterated:

“Amending a complaint is not an automatic right.” – Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir. 2008).

Citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), the court again acknowledged well‑established grounds for denying leave:

Undue delay,

Undue prejudice to the opposing party,

Futility of amendment, among others.

The Eleventh Circuit has consistently treated these as legitimate bases for district courts to withhold leave to amend even where Rule 15(a)’s general policy favors liberal amendment.

2. Rules 59(e) and 60(b): Post‑Judgment Relief

Once final judgment is entered, many circuits—including the Eleventh—often require that the judgment be altered under Rule 59(e) or relieved under Rule 60(b) before an amendment can proceed. The opinion notes:

Motions under Rule 59(e) and 60(b) are also reviewed for abuse of discretion, citing Shuford v. Fidelity Nat’l Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir. 2007) and Arthur v. Thomas, 739 F.3d 611, 628 (11th Cir. 2014).

However, the panel intentionally sidesteps the thorny doctrinal question of which standard formally governs at this stage. Instead, it assumes arguendo that the plaintiffs get the benefit of the most generous standard – Rule 15(a) – and still lose because of undue prejudice.

This is an important methodological move: by assuming the most plaintiff‑friendly rule applies and affirming nonetheless, the court leaves untouched (and unresolved) any deeper tension between Rule 15 and post‑judgment standards. The opinion is therefore deliberately narrow but highly practical: even under the best possible procedural lens for plaintiffs, the district court’s denial stands.

C. Precedents Cited and Their Influence

1. Rose v. Secretary, State of Georgia, 87 F.4th 469 (11th Cir. 2023)

The 2023 Rose decision is central. It provides the legal backdrop that makes the plaintiffs’ attempted amendment so significant. In that earlier appeal, the Eleventh Circuit:

Held that plaintiffs bringing § 2 vote dilution claims must satisfy the three Gingles preconditions.

Emphasized that the first Gingles precondition now includes a requirement that plaintiffs “offer a satisfactory remedial plan.”

Concluded that the plaintiffs’ sole proposed remedy—overhauling the election system from statewide at‑large to district-based single‑member districts for the PSC—was not a “satisfactory remedial plan.”

Therefore held that the plaintiffs failed to establish a cognizable § 2 claim, and reversed the district court’s injunction.

The effect of the 2023 decision was not a narrow evidentiary correction; it was a complete rejection of the plaintiffs’ theory of liability under § 2 as they had chosen to plead and prove it.

2. Thornburg v. Gingles and Allen v. Milligan

The 2025 opinion reiterates the classical framework for § 2 vote dilution claims from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and quotes Allen v. Milligan, 599 U.S. 1, 18 (2023), for the formulation of the first Gingles precondition:

“the minority group must be sufficiently large and [geographically] compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district.”

The panel links this precondition to the need for a “satisfactory remedial plan,” relying on Wright v. Sumter Cnty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, 979 F.3d 1282, 1302 (11th Cir. 2020). Thus, even in this procedural appeal, the earlier substantive voting‑rights doctrine frames why the plaintiffs now want to amend: they are trying to fix the remedial defect illuminated by Rose (2023).

3. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962)

Foman is the foundational Supreme Court case on leave to amend under Rule 15. It held that leave should be “freely given” unless there is a legitimate reason to deny it, such as:

Undue delay,

Bad faith,

Repeated failure to cure deficiencies,

Undue prejudice, or

Futility.

The Eleventh Circuit invokes Foman as the doctrinal anchor for recognizing “undue prejudice” as a valid, independent ground for denying leave to amend.

4. Eleventh Circuit Amendment Cases: Reese and Maynard

The court relies heavily on its own precedents interpreting and applying Foman:

Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir. 2008), for the proposition that a district court may deny leave to amend based on undue delay, prejudice, or futility, and that courts have inherent power to manage litigation by doing so.

Maynard v. Board of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dep’t of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., 342 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2003), where the court affirmed denial of leave to amend before trial because allowing amendment at the end of discovery would cause undue prejudice by forcing the defendant to re‑open discovery and incur additional costs.

By analogy, the panel reasons that if prejudice justified denial of amendment at the end of discovery but before trial in Maynard, then a fortiori prejudice justifies denial:

After full discovery,

After a full bench trial,

After an appeal and reversal, and

After issuance of the appellate mandate.

5. Abuse‑of‑Discretion Cases: Burger King, Shuford, Arthur

The panel cites:

Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1319 (11th Cir. 1999) for the general rule that denials of leave to amend are reviewed for abuse of discretion;

Shuford and Arthur for abuse‑of‑discretion review of Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motions, respectively.

These citations emphasize that the appellate court’s role is not to substitute its judgment de novo, but to ask only whether the district court’s decision was within a broad range of permissible choices. That deference substantially strengthens the case for affirmance here.

6. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273 (1982)

The plaintiffs argued that Pullman-Standard required further proceedings – and implicitly, an opportunity to amend – because the original district court decision allegedly rested on an “erroneous view of the law.” They relied on the Supreme Court’s statement:

“When an appellate court discerns that a district court has failed to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law, the usual rule is that there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the trial court to make the missing findings.” (emphasis added).

The Eleventh Circuit rejects this argument on two grounds:

Pullman-Standard articulates a “usual rule,” not a mandatory command. It describes typical appellate practice when factual findings are missing due to legal error, not an ironclad obligation.

Pullman-Standard governs appellate procedure, not district‑court discretion on amendments. It instructs appellate courts on how to handle incomplete factual findings; it says nothing about whether a district court must permit amendment after judgment and appeal.

Thus, Pullman-Standard does not alter the district court’s discretion under Rule 15, nor does it create a right for plaintiffs to re‑plead their case after losing on appeal.

D. The Court’s Legal Reasoning in Detail

1. Undue Prejudice to the Secretary

The panel’s core holding is that allowing amendment at this stage would “severely prejudice the Secretary.” The opinion details several categories of prejudice:

Reopened Discovery – The district court would have to reopen discovery to allow plaintiffs to develop a record to support their “new allegations” and newly proposed remedial plans. This would compel:

New depositions,

New document production,

Likely retention of new experts on both sides.

Additional Motions Practice – The new theories would almost certainly generate:

Fresh motions to dismiss,

New summary judgment motions,

New evidentiary motions (motions in limine), and related briefing.

Potential Retrial – The parties might need to “spend considerable resources to retry the case,” because the operative legal and factual questions would significantly change with the new remedial theories.

The court also notes an additional complication: the plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint alleges that Georgia’s “existing” method of electing PSC members violates the VRA. If the “existing” method has changed since the original 2020 filing, that would require litigating:

Whether the method has, in fact, changed,

Whether the three‑year‑old trial record remains current, and

Whether new, more timely evidence must be developed and presented.

All of this, the court concludes, constitutes “significant” prejudice to the Secretary and squarely justifies denial of leave under Foman and Maynard.

2. Judicial Economy vs. Prejudice

The plaintiffs argued that judicial economy favored allowing amendment in this existing case rather than forcing a separate, future lawsuit. The court responds in two ways:

Judicial economy is a general policy; prejudice is a concrete harm. The court holds that “general policy concern[s]” about efficiency “do not refute the specific prejudice that the Secretary would face,” which is a sufficient, standalone ground for denial.

Speculative future litigation is not a sound basis to override present prejudice. The panel notes:

The plaintiffs “do not specify who would bring this hypothetical new case.”

If the same plaintiffs brought a new suit, they would face substantial hurdles under the doctrine of claim preclusion (res judicata).

No specific alternative plaintiffs are identified who could bring a new case immune from preclusion concerns.

Thus, the court declines to prioritize hypothetical efficiency in possible future litigation over the concrete, immediate prejudice that amendment would cause the Secretary.

3. Inherent Power to Manage Litigation

Citing Reese, the court observes that a district court may use its “inherent power to manage the conduct of litigation” by denying leave to amend when the amendment would result in undue prejudice. This reinforces the idea that case management, finality, and fairness to both parties are legitimate institutional interests that can outweigh the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15.

4. No Entitlement to a Second Merits Round

A key theme of the opinion is that the plaintiffs had already fully litigated their chosen theory:

They selected a particular theory of liability and remedy under § 2.

They litigated that theory from complaint through trial and appeal.

The Eleventh Circuit definitively rejected that theory as legally non‑viable.

To then allow amendment to present new remedial plans – effectively a new theory of how § 2 could be violated and remedied – would give plaintiffs a “second bite at the apple” after the first bite failed. The court implicitly views this as inconsistent with basic principles of finality and fair notice to defendants about the case they must defend.

E. Impact and Implications

1. For Future Voting Rights Act Litigation

Even though non‑precedential, the decision has important practical implications for § 2 litigation in the Eleventh Circuit:

Front‑load remedial planning. Plaintiffs in VRA vote‑dilution cases must think carefully at the outset about the remedial plans they are prepared to propose. Waiting until after an adverse appellate ruling to introduce alternative remedies will likely be too late.

One shot at satisfying Gingles. Once a § 2 case has gone through trial and an appeal, plaintiffs should not expect to be able to cure a defective Gingles showing (especially the remedial aspect of the first precondition) by amending the complaint post‑mandate.

Strategic caution in choosing a single, “dramatic” remedy. If plaintiffs choose to pin their entire case on a single, sweeping remedy—as in the PSC case—failure of that remedy may end the litigation entirely, without a chance to pivot to more modest or alternative remedies later.

2. For Civil Procedure and Amendment Practice in General

More broadly, the case sends a clear message about amendment practice in complex federal litigation:

The later in the case, the stronger the showing plaintiffs must make. While Rule 15(a) speaks of “freely giv[ing]” leave, that liberality is tempered by heightened concerns about prejudice and finality when litigation is far advanced.

Post‑judgment amendments are exceptional, not routine. Especially after an appeal and mandate, attempts to amend will face serious skepticism unless the proposed changes are minor or the prejudice to defendants is negligible.

Defendants’ litigation investment is legally cognizable prejudice. The court explicitly treats the Secretary’s sunk costs—extensive discovery, expert work, a bench trial, and an appellate victory—as relevant and weighty when assessing “undue prejudice.”

3. For Litigation Against Statewide Bodies Like the PSC

The case underscores the special complexity of suing state‑wide regulatory bodies:

Remedies that wholly restructure statewide election systems for functionally statewide offices are likely to face intense scrutiny under the remedial component of Gingles.

Courts may be wary of “single, dramatic remedies” that essentially transform the political character of such bodies, particularly if alternative, less disruptive remedies are not seriously explored.

Although the 2025 opinion does not itself address the substantive merits of such remedies, it functionally channels future litigants toward more thoroughly developed remedial theories from the outset.

IV. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Vote Dilution

Section 2 of the VRA prohibits any voting practice or procedure that “results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote on account of race or color. In vote‑dilution cases (as opposed to voter suppression), the claim is that the structure of an election system—such as at‑large voting—dilutes the voting power of a minority group.

In Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court established three “preconditions” a plaintiff generally must prove in a vote‑dilution case involving districting or at‑large systems:

The minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured single‑member district.

The minority group is politically cohesive (its members tend to vote together).

The white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.

Failure to prove any one of these preconditions is usually fatal to a § 2 vote dilution claim.

B. The “Remedial Plan” Aspect of the First Gingles Precondition

The first Gingles precondition is not purely theoretical. Plaintiffs must do more than show that, “on paper,” a compact district could exist. In the Eleventh Circuit, they must also propose a concrete, “satisfactory remedial plan” – a specific, workable districting or election scheme that the court could realistically adopt.

In the original Rose appeal, the plaintiffs proposed only one remedy: converting the PSC system from a statewide, at‑large election for a statewide regulatory body into a series of local, single‑member district elections. The Eleventh Circuit found this remedy legally unsatisfactory, which meant the first Gingles precondition was not met, and the § 2 claim failed.

C. At‑Large vs. Single‑Member District Elections

At‑large elections: All voters in the jurisdiction (e.g., the entire state) vote for all seats. This can dilute minority votes if the minority is geographically concentrated but outvoted statewide.

Single‑member district elections: The jurisdiction is divided into districts; each district elects one representative. If lines are drawn fairly, a geographically concentrated minority group may be able to elect candidates of choice in some districts.

The plaintiffs sought to replace Georgia’s statewide PSC elections with district-based elections, arguing that this would allow Black voters concentrated in certain areas to elect their preferred candidates.

D. “Undue Delay,” “Undue Prejudice,” and “Futility”

Under Rule 15(a) and Foman v. Davis, courts may deny amendment if:

Undue delay – The plaintiff waits an excessively long time without a good reason to amend, especially if the information was available earlier.

Undue prejudice – The amendment would unfairly disadvantage the other side, usually by:

Requiring extensive new discovery,

Changing the theory of the case late in the process, or

Forcing duplication of costly litigation efforts.

Futility – Even if allowed, the amended complaint would still fail to state a claim or would be barred as a matter of law.

In this case, the district court found all three, but the Eleventh Circuit affirmed solely on the basis of undue prejudice, which by itself is sufficient.

E. “Per Curiam,” “Non‑Argument Calendar,” and “Not for Publication”

Per curiam – An opinion issued in the name of the court rather than a specific judge. Here, Judges Jill Pryor, Branch, and Brasher comprise the panel.

Non‑argument calendar – The case was decided without oral argument, based solely on the briefs and record.

Not for publication – Under Eleventh Circuit rules, the opinion is non‑precedential. It does not bind future panels, though it may be cited as persuasive authority.

F. Mandate and Claim Preclusion

After an appeal is decided, the court of appeals issues a mandate to the district court instructing it on the disposition (e.g., affirm, reverse, remand). Once the mandate issues, the district court must act in accordance with it; its room to diverge is very limited.

The panel also alludes to claim preclusion (res judicata), the doctrine that prevents parties from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in a prior action that ended in a final judgment on the merits between the same parties. The court suggests that:

If the same plaintiffs filed a new case about the same PSC election method, they would likely face claim preclusion obstacles.

This undermines the plaintiffs’ argument that, for judicial economy, amendment should be allowed to avoid a separate lawsuit – because such a lawsuit might be barred altogether.

V. Conclusion: Key Takeaways and Broader Significance

The Eleventh Circuit’s 2025 decision in Rose v. Secretary of State of Georgia delivers a clear procedural message in the context of high‑stakes voting rights litigation:

Leave to amend is liberal, but not limitless. Plaintiffs do not have a guaranteed right to re‑plead their case after fully litigating and losing on appeal.

Undue prejudice to the defendant is a powerful brake on late‑stage amendments. Years of discovery, expert testimony, trial, and appellate work are not costs that can be casually imposed twice on a defendant, especially when plaintiffs seek to introduce new legal or remedial theories post‑mandate.

Remedial theories in § 2 cases must be developed and vetted early. The case underscores the risk of relying on a single, sweeping remedial proposal: if it fails, plaintiffs are unlikely to get a post‑judgment opportunity to develop alternatives.

Pullman-Standard does not open a back door to serial relitigation. The Supreme Court’s guidance on remand for missing factual findings due to legal error does not require district courts to grant leave to amend after judgment and appeal.

In the broader legal context, this decision strengthens the principle of finality in federal civil litigation and reinforces district courts’ authority to manage their dockets and protect defendants from repetitive, costly relitigation. While plaintiffs retain robust tools to refine and expand their claims earlier in the process, those tools become sharply limited once the case has gone to trial, on appeal, and back again with a clear directive that their original theory fails as a matter of law.

For litigants, particularly in complex civil rights and election cases, the lesson is straightforward: fully develop both your liability theory and your remedial options before the case reaches trial and appeal. The courts will not readily permit a second retooling of the case after the first has been conclusively resolved.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 17:57:16.768689

Gunasekera is an assistant professor of marketing at Ferris State, in Big Rapids, Michigan, according to the university's website. He holds a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Nevada.

Federal authorities said Gunasekera entered the U.S. in February 1998, then went to Canada. In August 1998, he was arrested by police in Brampton, Ontario, and accused of making death threats.

Three days later he was arrested again in Canada on charges of invitation to sexual touching and sexual interference. DHS said Gunasekera admitted to officers that this case involved a minor. He was convicted in November 1998 and sentenced to one month behind bars and one year of probation.

He was also arrested in September 2003 by law enforcement in Las Vegas and accused of open and gross lewdness, DHS said. He was convicted in January 2004 of disorderly conduct.

“It's sickening that a sex offender was working as a professor on an American college campus and was given access to vulnerable students to potentially victimize them,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Thanks to the brave ICE law enforcement officers, this sicko is behind bars and no longer able to prey on Americans.""

Authorities said Gunasekera had been in the U.S. on a student visa. When he applied for a change of status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, authorities realized he had been convicted of crimes in Canada.

""Over the years Gunasekera repeatedly attempted to manipulate our immigration system between applications, denials, and appeals despite the convictions in Canada that made him ineligible for legal status in the United States,"" DHS said in the release.

Officials said he remains in ICE custody as he awaits immigration proceedings.

But the celebratory mood was clouded by the detention of her husband, Enes Abak. “Her soulmate, her everything,” was not there to celebrate the long-awaited date.

That is because on Tuesday, at least six immigration agents detained him at the couple’s home in the 4600 block of North Kenmore Street, said Eleana Molise, director of housing and community services for the 46th Ward.

Molise arrived at the block after neighbors and members of the local rapid response group reported the presence of four unmarked vehicles and agents wearing ICE vests early Tuesday.

According to a neighbor, Abak walked out of his house around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday carrying coffee and cigarettes when he was detained in what appeared to be a targeted operation, Molise said.

Abak, 29, is Kurdish, the largest and most discriminated-against minority group in Turkey, according to the Minority Rights Group. Since the 90s, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people have been internally displaced or left the country to escape violence. The group estimates up to 3 million Kurdish people have been displaced.

Speaking Kurdish is forbidden in Turkey, as is naming children with Kurdish names, according to Gurtovia and media reports. And the State Department said there were credible reports of human rights issues and persecution of Kurdish people in a 2023 report.

Fearing for his life, Abak fled Turkey and arrived in the United States in 2022. He was paroled into the country and had a pending political asylum application, Gurtovaia said.

“We never missed a court date. We were very responsible. We were following every letter of the law,” she said.

Earlier this year, he attended an immigration court hearing where he shared why he had fled the country.

He was persecuted by local authorities, had spent time incarcerated and feared for his life, Gurtovaia said.

“He’s a wonderful young man, but unfortunately, because of his nationality, he faced very difficult times in Turkey. He was followed by [authorities] and that’s why he even served time in jail,” she said.

When he was released, he feared he could be detained without reason again and without money, he and his family would have no means to defend him.

In recent years, human rights watchdogs have denounced the unjust incarceration of Kurdish people. Last year, Turkish authorities sentenced 24 Kurdish politicians to nine to 42 years of prison on bogus charges of crimes against the state, according to the nonprofit Human Rights Watch.

“Justice works very differently in Turkey if you’re Kurdish,” Gurtovaia said.

Abak has no criminal history in the United States, she said. A U.S. immigration judge did not find him to be a high-risk individual, and the couple was waiting for his next immigration court date in January, she said.

Yet, it appears immigration authorities detained him over his arrest in Turkey, Gurtovaia said. While seeking information about his whereabouts, an immigration officer told a family member he had been detained “because he had an open case in Turkey,” related to his arrest, she said.

“I don’t understand how you can grab a person for that, because that’s why this person is afraid of his life and that’s why he’s asking the American government to protect him,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Block Club’s request for comment.

‘We Both Have A Dream’

Abak and Gurtovaia met in 2023 on a dating app and “fell in love immediately,” she said, smiling through her tears.

Abak works as a manager in auto body shop and Gurtovaia is a teacher in a Russian-speaking educational center. On the side, they both work as rideshare or delivery drivers to earn additional income, desperately needed to pay fees and legal expenses for both of their immigration cases and to build a family together.

“We both have a dream. I have dreams that I have a son who will be like his father and he has a dream that he will have a daughter who will be like me,” she said.

Gurtovaia was born in Russia and is half Ukrainian and half Belarusian. She moved to the U.S. in 2017 after receiving a green card through the immigration lottery. Once she was eligible, she applied for citizenship, she said.

The couple got married about a year ago and lived together in Uptown with their two cats. This December, they planned to continue with a costly fertility treatment. Once a U.S. citizen, she had planned to request permanent residency for Abak through a family-based application, she said.

Those and other plans shattered after immigration agents detained Abak Tuesday, just a day before her naturalization ceremony. He was going to join her for the special day, cook traditional food and celebrate with friends Wednesday night.

“Now I’m just worried because I have heard about the conditions in detention centers and I am not even sure that he has access to water,” she said Wednesday.

Abak was transferred to a detention center in El Paso, Texas Wednesday after being taken to ICE’s processing facility in suburban Broadview Tuesday. He remained in detention in Texas as of Friday morning, according to ICE records.

On Thursday, Gurtovaia was able to speak to him after he called briefly. She had worried after not hearing from him for over a day. They both told each other I love you so much, she said. She promised she’d do anything to help him.

Showered with support from neighbors and officials, Gurtovaia has pledged to fight for her husband’s release.

She was referred to a lawyer and has launched a GoFundMe to raise funds for his legal defense, which could cost thousands of dollars between filing fees and attorney costs. Without Abak’s income, she is facing “crushing” financial pressure, according to the GoFundMe page.

“The process is long, painful, and shockingly expensive. I’m giving everything I have—every hour, every ounce of strength—but I cannot do this alone,” the GoFundMe reads.

Abak’s detention unveils the reality of the country’s broken immigration system, Clay said.

“We don’t have a perfect process that people can follow. And even if they do follow that imperfect process that we have, they’re still being targeted and their lives are in jeopardy,” she said.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2851-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 17:56:32.441938

Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.

“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”

“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”

The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.

Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.

Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.

“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”

One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”

All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.

“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”

“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.

After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:

“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”

Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.

Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.

“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.

“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ICE-courthouses.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 18:57:00.207699

The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA.
Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers.
Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district.
Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.","At a time when the federal government is dismantling civil rights protections in K-12 schools, California is expanding them — although some wonder how far the state will go to combat discrimination in schools.

A new law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, creates an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office will have a staff of at least six, including an antisemitism coordinator, who will educate school districts about the harms of bias and investigate discrimination complaints.

“I think it’s a good idea and the state of California will pull it off. The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. “But for it to be successful, it has to have real responsibility and real power.”

The new law stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California last year following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Authored by Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), the law is intended to eliminate anti-Jewish and other bias in the classroom and ensure that students of all ethnicities and religions feel protected.

But the road to Newsom’s desk was not smooth. The bill faced tough opposition from the California Teachers Assn. , the state’s largest teachers union, which argued that the law would limit teachers’ right to free speech by curbing their ability to discuss the conflict in Gaza or other topical issues. The union declined to comment for this article.

Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers. The idea, he said, is to help schools stamp out bullying, discrimination and other acts targeting specific groups of students.

“The idea that this law is about policing is hogwash,” Zbur said. “It’s intended to be productive, to provide districts with resources so they can prevent students from being harmed in school.”

Federal layoffs and closures

Discrimination has long been illegal in California schools. Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district. But much K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement has fallen on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. Created in the mid-1960s, the office investigates complaints about a range of issues, such as school segregation, unfair discipline practices and whether students with disabilities or English learners are receiving the services they’re entitled to.

In March, the Trump administration announced it was laying off nearly half of the U.S. Department of Education workforce and closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. That’s meant a steep decline in the number of cases and long delays for those the office investigates. In the three months after the Department of Education cuts, for example, the office received nearly 5,000 complaints but investigated only 309.

On Tuesday, the Department of Education went even further, spinning off some of the agency’s largest responsibilities to other federal departments — including much of the administration of elementary and high school funding. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative vision for the country that so far Trump has followed, calls for the Office of Civil Rights to become part of the Department of Justice and for it to “reject gender ideology and critical race theory.”

The U.S. Department of Education didn’t respond to a request for comment.

‘Cutting off funding, that’s what works’

California’s new Office of Civil Rights will have a director and several coordinators who will oversee anti-discrimination cases based on race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The director and anti-discrimination coordinators will be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, likely after Jan. 1.

The office will provide schools with materials about preventing discrimination, and work with districts that have been the subject of complaints from students, families or the public. In serious cases, the office will recommend more intensive assistance to the state Department of Education to correct problems. For districts that persistently flout anti-discrimination laws, “the department may use any means necessary to effect compliance,” according to laws already in place. That may include cutting funding for textbooks or other materials found to be discriminatory.

The office will also submit an annual report to the Legislature on the overall picture of discrimination in schools, including the number of complaints, how they were resolved, and their outcomes.

But to be successful, the office will have to be nonpartisan, transparent and fair, Orfield said. Cases against a school should include strong evidence, and schools should have the opportunity to defend themselves and appeal a verdict if they believe it was wrongly issued.

And the office should not shy away from cutting funds to schools that don’t comply, he said. In the 1960s and ‘70s, the federal Office of Civil Rights cut funds to more than 100 schools in the South that refused to desegregate — a move that may have been the only way to force compliance, Orfield said.

“Cutting off funding, that’s what works,” he said. “Although if you’re going to have sanctions, there must be due process.”

Photo ops and reports?

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the public interest law firm Public Counsel, agreed that enforcement will be the key to whether the new office is effective.

“If the office just issues reports and does photo ops, we don’t need another one of those,” Rosenbaum said. “The issue is whether or not they can enforce these rights across the board.”

He’d also like to see the office take a more proactive approach instead of only responding to individuals’ complaints. Education itself, he said, is a civil right, and too many students are not receiving the high-quality lessons in safe, well-equipped schools that they’re entitled to.

Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.

“There’s an urgency for California to fill a void,” Rosenbaum said. “It should have happened decades ago, but it’s a good start.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d4a733/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2F5d%2F507d868e474f9c83d1da2dde55b6%2F1522997-me-0920-newsom-immig-bills-gem-003.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:56:48.050249

After the Trump administration rewrote ICE policy on July 8 to cut off bond hearings for most locked-up immigrants, emergency lawsuits exploded nationwide.

They came from people who’ve spent years, even decades, in the U.S. with clean records while pursuing asylum or other legal status, who were seized at workplaces, courthouses, and routine check-ins.

In more than 700 cases, at least 225 federal judges have found the change to be likely illegal and a due-process violation—including 23 selected by Trump, 79, according to Politico.

Judges across at least 35 states have bristled at the government’s attempt to treat long-time U.S. residents as if they were still “seeking admission,” triggering mandatory detention once reserved for new arrivals, in a reading that breaks with three decades of practice.

Before July 8, most people in deportation proceedings remained free while their cases wound through immigration courts, an executive-branch system that routinely weighed bond.

One judge likened the logic to insisting a movie-theater gatecrasher is still at the door—an interpretation that dozens of courts have rejected as defying common sense.

Joining the chorus blasting the policy, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder wrote on Nov. 21, “The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority… given the continued onslaught of litigation.”

In Michigan, Trump appointee Hala Jarbou described more than 100 individual petitions landing in her courtroom before another 97 detainees filed a joint case seeking release, illustrating their sheer volume.

And in Idaho, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill wrote that “dozens of district courts across the nation—with more each day—have rejected DHS’s expansion of… mandatory detention,” freeing 17 people seized in an Oct. 19 raid, Politico reported.

Broader relief is now taking shape. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have certified class actions, while a California judge has approved a nationwide class that could force bond hearings for those held under the July policy, according to Politico’s review.

Appeals courts in the 5th and 8th Circuits are being asked to move quickly. At the same time, the administration has urged slower timetables elsewhere—setting up conflicting clocks and a likely sprint to the Supreme Court.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE’s parent agency in charge of migration in the U.S., argues it’s enforcing the statute.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Politico in a statement.

McLaughlin told the Daily Beast that Trump and Noem were focused on enforcing the law.

“The Board of Immigration Appeals’ recent ruling vindicating DHS on holding aliens without bond was the final nail in the coffin for Biden’s catch and release policies that dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so,” she said.

Posted on Truth Social on Thursday after an Afghani national who had worked with the US military shot two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the announcement promised a sweeping freeze on admissions from vast stretches of the Global South.

This is in addition to the cancellation of ‘millions’ of Biden-era approvals. It also vowed to strip non-citizens of federal benefits and subsidies and even denaturalise migrants deemed ‘non-compatible with Western civilisation’.

But behind the headline-grabbing language, some experts say nothing has legally changed, arguing that Trump’s vow is still just rhetoric, with no executive order, no proclamation and no use of the powers needed to make it real.

That, they say, leaves the administration’s earlier actions as the operative policy, which already cast a long shadow over African migration.

But that assertion is countered by Federico Manfredi Firmian, a foreign policy expert and research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, who argues that the absence of a formal law doesn’t prevent “rapid administrative action”.

Africa already on the front line of Trump restrictions

In June, the White House reinstated and expanded a nationality-based travel ban that fully blocks most entry categories for 12 countries, seven of them in Africa: Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.

For nationals of these states, consular officers have minimal discretion. A second tier of states – Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo – face partial restrictions affecting certain visa classes. Refusal rates have since surged, and even routine applications have become mired in administrative hold.

This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder

Then came the leaked State Department memorandum signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The document lists 36 countries flagged for potential escalation if they fail to meet security and document-verification benchmarks – 25 of them are African.

They range from the continent’s largest economies, including Nigeria, Egypt and Ethiopia, to smaller states such as Cabo Verde, Uganda and Zambia. Although the memo stops short of imposing bans, it explicitly signals the possibility of visa restrictions or full travel suspensions. For many African governments and diaspora groups, it has functioned as a de facto blacklist.

Against this backdrop, Trump’s rhetoric about a ‘Third World’ pause lands less as an entirely new threat than as an intensification and possible widening of a framework already under construction.

However, Trump's latest announcement is more than political theatre, according to Firmian. “This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder, with several pathways now being frozen or effectively shut off,” he tells The Africa Report.

What a ‘Third World’ pause might actually mean

If the administration treated ‘Third World’ as shorthand for ‘developing countries’, almost the entire African continent would fall under a single catch-all label. But the White House doesn’t need a sweeping ban to achieve the same political effect.

Politically, the ambiguity gives the administration maximum room to escalate without the diplomatic blowback that a formal proclamation would trigger. It lets officials quietly widen restrictions across the 36 ‘at-risk’ states while insisting they haven’t imposed a continent-wide freeze.

Rather than an outright prohibition, which would almost certainly be struck down as arbitrary and discriminatory, officials are expected to replicate the June 2025 playbook: country-specific dossiers alleging vetting gaps, security risks and bureaucratic failures, dressed up with narrow waivers to signal restraint.

That pathway allows Washington to tighten the screws on African and other migration through rising refusal rates for students, visitors, professionals and family-based applicants, shrinking legal pathways while preserving the appearance of a rules-based process.

Voiding asylum

Trump’s most sweeping promises – shutting down asylum or cancelling African protections en masse – run straight into statutory guardrails Congress built into the system. Under law, anyone on US soil or at its border has the right to seek asylum, reinforced by the non-refoulement rule that bars Washington from sending people back to places where they face persecution.

Those limits were brought into sharp focus in July 2025, when a federal judge halted Trump’s bid to ‘completely shut down’ asylum at the southern border after the administration declared an ‘invasion’ and froze the US Customs and Border Protection One system.

Many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal

That makes it virtually impossible for the White House to void African asylum claims wholesale. Legal experts say it can make screening more onerous, expand detention and slow cases to a standstill but cannot legally erase claims in bulk.

The real vulnerability lies outside US territory. Trump’s January 2025 orders, though partially blocked, have already stranded thousands in northern Mexico, shut down refugee flights and frozen the US Refugee Admissions Programme.

For African refugees in camps in Kenya, Rwanda or the Sahel, the pipeline has collapsed. A formal ‘Third World’ pause would lock that closure in place and raise the political cost of reversing it, even if courts later curb the administration’s reach.

Can African green-card holders or US citizens lose their status?

Trump’s latest escalation – abruptly announcing an end to legal protections for Somali residents in Minnesota and urging authorities to ""send them back to where they came from"" – has sent shockwaves through African communities across the US.

In his Truth Social post, he claimed Minnesota was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” under Governor Tim Walz and announced the immediate termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme for Somalis in the state. Walz dismissed the move as predictable scapegoating, saying the president was “broadly targeting an entire community” to shift attention.

Minnesota hosts the largest Somali population in the country, with roughly 79,000 residents, though only 705 Somalis nationwide currently hold TPS, according to Congressional data. Many in the community fear that the president’s rhetoric presages something more sweeping, including threats to green-card holders and even naturalised citizens.

It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries

But the legal firewall protecting permanent residents and citizens remains substantial. Green-card holders can only be removed through individual proceedings based on defined statutory grounds, such as certain criminal convictions or demonstrable immigration fraud.

Naturalised citizens can be stripped of citizenship only if the government proves they lied about material facts during naturalisation. Political views, activism or national origin are not grounds for denaturalisation, no matter the campaign language.

Where the administration does have greater freedom is in temporary humanitarian protections and parole programmes, which can be narrowed, paused or terminated — as the Minnesota decision illustrates. But even the most aggressive use of executive power cannot deliver Trump’s promise to ‘cancel millions’ of admissions.

However, the government has broad authority to slow or suspend visas and refugee processing, review existing green cards and revoke benefits, Firmian says. “Once implementing guidance is issued, many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal.”

Efforts to unduly politicise migration

Uche Igwe, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), says Trump’s rhetoric fits a wider pattern, describing it as “a very myopic oversimplification” of migration, which has become “far more complex”.

“It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries,” he tells The Africa Report, pointing to the UK, where the Labour government has also moved to tighten immigration rules.

Seaside city councilors clashed Monday over whether the city should issue a written statement acknowledging recent federal immigration enforcement activity that residents say disrupted businesses and frightened families, leaving councilors deadlocked after a tense and lengthy debate.

The discussion followed a work session in which councilors agreed the city should publish clear information explaining what it can and cannot do under Oregon law in response to federal actions.

Councilors directed staff to issue a social media post and add prominently placed information on the city’s website— including in the Community Spotlight section— outlining residents’ rights, the role of local police and steps people can take to ensure who is pulling them over.

City Manager Spencer Kyle said the social media post should address what the city can and can’t do, along with informing the public that it is not city police officers conducting immigration enforcement.

Councilors also agreed to notify the public when the city receives its next shipment of “red cards,” wallet-sized rights-information cards soon to be available in City Hall.

“Letting people know these are accessible is important,” Councilor Tita Montero said.

But members sharply disagreed over whether the city should go further and issue a written statement addressing the impact of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity itself.

Several councilors argued silence would send the wrong message.

“I think not saying something at this point would be a sign of cowardice,”

Councilor Seamus McVey said. “They upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses. They gave us no warning. We were as blindsided as everyone else.”

He added that acknowledging those effects was a matter of transparency, not politics. “It is not partisan to say people were hurt and businesses were hurt,” McVey said. “That’s a fact.”

Others pushed back, warning that the city risked overstepping its authority.

“I don’t want Seaside to get in the middle of a federal immigration debate,” Council President Seth Morrisey said. “Our jurisdiction is local. We should stick to what the law says we can do and avoid statements that pull us into something outside our lane.”

Tensions rose as councilors pressed each other to explain that stance.

“At no point has anyone suggested we interfere with federal operations,” McVey said.

Councilor Heidi Hoffman acknowledged that what happens in Seaside is well within the city’s responsibility.

“They (ICE) upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses, and they didn’t give us any prior warning, and so the city was as blindsided as everybody else was,” Hoffman said. “There was no professional courtesy given; they just came in and started doing these things. So I think we can acknowledge that and say we were surprised, too.”

Councilor Christine Binnicker questioned how detailed such a statement would need to be to remain factual.

“If we’re saying businesses shut down, are we prepared to list which ones?” Binnicker asked. “If we’re going to make claims, we need to be able to back them up.”

McVey dismissed that as unnecessary. “There’s a difference between acknowledging some businesses shut down and doxing them,” he said. “We’re not naming people. We’re acknowledging an impact.”

The debate continued for nearly 30 minutes as councilors disagreed over whether acknowledging community disruption constituted political messaging.

“If it’s not written down, it doesn’t exist,” McVey said. “We keep saying these things aloud, but residents need something they can see and point to.”

Others insisted spoken statements and informational posts were enough.

By the end of the discussion, the council appeared split 3–3, with no clear path to consensus.

Mayor Steve Wright said the council is going to have to agree to disagree. “We’re not going to get any further.”

Councilors agreed to move forward with providing materials and updates, which have been made public on the city’s website: cityofseaside.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=29.

Date: November 26, 2025

Note: The decision is a memorandum opinion entered under Alaska Appellate Rule 214 and is expressly non‑precedential. It nonetheless provides a useful illustration of how Alaska courts apply statutory limits on prisoner relief, as well as the doctrines of mootness and ripeness, in access‑to‑courts litigation.

I. Introduction

This case concerns an indigent Alaska prisoner, Raymond Katchatag, who alleged that the Department of Corrections (DOC), specifically staff at Spring Creek Correctional Center (SCCC), violated his constitutional right of access to the courts by refusing to promptly provide him with free, certified copies of his prison trust account statement. Those statements were required to support his applications for filing fee exemptions in two administrative appeals to the superior court.

Katchatag filed a civil action seeking:

Injunctive relief – a broad, system‑wide injunction requiring DOC to provide certified six‑month Offender Trust Account (OTA) statements to any inmate, upon request, at any time, for legal and non‑legal purposes, apparently free of charge; and

Declaratory relief – a declaration that DOC’s actions and policies violated his state and federal constitutional rights, principally his right of access to the courts.

The superior court granted summary judgment for DOC, holding that it could not grant the requested injunctive relief under Alaska Statute (AS) 09.19.200 and that the claims for declaratory relief were moot because Katchatag ultimately received the statements and suffered no prejudice in his administrative appeals.

On appeal, the Alaska Supreme Court affirmed. While explicitly declining to reach the merits of the constitutional access‑to‑courts claims, the Court held that:

No genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment; and

DOC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because:

The requested injunction violated AS 09.19.200’s “narrow tailoring” requirement and exceeded what was necessary to remedy any alleged violation; and

The requests for declaratory relief were either moot (as to the past denial of copies) or unripe (as to generalized future harms under DOC policy) and did not satisfy the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act.

Although non‑precedential, the opinion offers an instructive application of several important doctrines in Alaska prisoner litigation:

Summary judgment standards in prisoner civil rights cases;

Statutory limits on prospective relief against correctional facilities under AS 09.19.200;

The doctrines of mootness and ripeness in the context of access‑to‑courts claims; and

The proper scope and function of declaratory judgments under AS 22.10.020(g).

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Factual Background

While incarcerated at SCCC in early 2022, Katchatag prepared to file two separate administrative appeals in the superior court, challenging:

His administrative segregation; and

A disciplinary sanction imposed by DOC.

Under AS 09.19.010(b)(2), a prisoner seeking exemption from filing fees must submit specified financial information, including “a certified copy of the prisoner’s account statement from the correctional facility.” DOC maintains inmate funds in Offender Trust Accounts (OTAs). Prison policy required prisoners to pay $0.15 per page for copies, but indigent prisoners could obtain free legal copies if the superintendent or designee verified indigency and authorized them under DOC Policy 808.12.

Over January and February 2022, Katchatag—an indigent inmate—made multiple requests for free, certified six‑month OTA statements so he could apply for filing fee exemptions in his administrative appeals. SCCC staff repeatedly denied his requests, citing a practice of providing only one free certified six‑month statement every three months and the need for superintendent approval for free copies.

After several denials, he filed a “Prisoner Grievance” complaining about the refusal. The grievance was screened and denied based on the view that he had already received a certified statement in December 2021 and would not be eligible for another until March 15, 2022.

In early April, Katchatag submitted a document titled “Prisoner Grievance Appeal Statement” to the Deputy Director of Institutions. Within a week, the deputy director directed SCCC to provide him the requested copies, and SCCC gave him six certified copies on April 19, 2022. He used these to perfect his two administrative appeals, which were filed on April 26, 2022.

Ultimately, one appeal was initially dismissed as untimely but was immediately reopened, with an additional 90 days granted for briefing; the other was dismissed for lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction under AS 33.30.295(a). Neither appeal failed because of the timing or availability of the OTA statements.

B. Procedural History

In May 2022—about a month after receiving his copies and filing his appeals—Katchatag filed the present civil action in the superior court against DOC, its Commissioner, the Deputy Director of Institutions, the superintendent, a lieutenant, and a facility standards officer. Acting pro se, he alleged that DOC’s refusal to provide timely free OTA statements violated his constitutional rights, including his right of access to the courts. He requested:

A preliminary and permanent injunction mandating that DOC provide any inmate (sentenced or unsentenced) with a certified six‑month statement of their OTA on request, at any time, for legal and non‑legal uses, statewide; and

A declaratory judgment that DOC’s conduct and policies violated his constitutional rights.

DOC moved for summary judgment. The superior court granted the motion, holding:

It lacked authority under AS 09.19.200 to grant the broad prospective injunctive relief Katchatag sought; and

His request for declaratory relief was moot because he had already obtained the statements and the delay did not prejudice his administrative appeals.

Katchatag appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.

C. The Supreme Court’s Holding

The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed the superior court’s grant of summary judgment. In essence, it held:

No genuine dispute of material fact existed:

Although Katchatag alleged that DOC’s refusals prevented him from filing his administrative appeals, the undisputed record showed that both appeals were ultimately filed and that their merits were not prejudiced by the delay.

Any dispute about whether his communication to the deputy director was “an appeal” was immaterial to the outcome.

DOC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law:

Injunctive relief: Under AS 09.19.200, any prospective relief against a correctional facility must be narrowly drawn and no broader than necessary to remedy the specific violation. Katchatag’s requested system‑wide, unconditional right to unlimited free certified OTA statements for all inmates was far broader than necessary and thus not permissible, even assuming a constitutional violation.

Declaratory relief (past denial): The claim was moot because Katchatag eventually obtained the copies, used them to file his appeals, and suffered no live, remediable injury.

Declaratory relief (attack on DOC policy): Any generalized challenge to DOC’s policy limiting free statements and requiring superintendent approval was unripe, because there was no concrete showing of current or imminent legal injury, only hypothetical future harms.

The Court expressly declined to address the underlying constitutional questions (e.g., whether the delay violated the right of access to the courts) because resolution of those questions was unnecessary to decide the case.

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Precedents and Authorities Cited

1. Summary Judgment Standards

Smith v. Anchorage School District, 240 P.3d 834 (Alaska 2010):

Cited for the standard of review: grants of summary judgment are reviewed de novo, and the record is viewed in the light most favorable to the non‑moving party with all reasonable inferences drawn in that party’s favor.

Also cited for the principle that the appellate court uses its independent judgment on legal questions such as whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Witt v. State, Department of Corrections, 75 P.3d 1030 (Alaska 2003):

Cited indirectly through Smith as part of the articulation of the summary judgment standard in prisoner litigation.

Reinforces that in assessing summary judgment, all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non‑movant—even when the non‑movant is a prisoner.

Christensen v. Alaska Sales & Service, Inc., 335 P.3d 514 (Alaska 2014):

Provides the doctrinal framework for summary judgment under Alaska Civil Rule 56.

Key principles drawn from Christensen:

The moving party bears the initial burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Once that burden is met, the non‑moving party must respond with specific facts showing a genuine factual dispute, not mere conclusory allegations.

A material fact is one on which the resolution of an issue turns.

Mitchell v. Teck Cominco Alaska Inc., 193 P.3d 751 (Alaska 2008), and

State, Department of Highways v. Green, 586 P.2d 595 (Alaska 1978):

These cases support the allocation of burdens on summary judgment: once the moving party establishes the absence of a genuine factual dispute, the non‑moving party must adduce evidence reasonably tending to contradict the movant’s evidence.

The opinion invokes Green via a footnote in Christensen to emphasize that a bare assertion of “dispute” is not enough; specific, conflicting evidence is necessary.

2. Mootness and Ripeness

State v. ACLU of Alaska, 204 P.3d 364 (Alaska 2009), and Brause v. State, Department of Health & Social Services, 21 P.3d 357 (Alaska 2001):

These cases establish that Alaska courts decide cases only when:

The plaintiff has standing (a concrete stake in the outcome); and

The case is both ripe (not speculative or hypothetical) and not moot (still involves a live controversy).

Clark v. State, Department of Corrections, 156 P.3d 384 (Alaska 2007):

Defines mootness as arising where:

A decision would no longer affect the parties’ rights in any meaningful way; or

The plaintiff would not be entitled to any relief even if successful.

Young v. State, 502 P.3d 964 (Alaska 2022):

Cited for the public interest exception to mootness.

The exception applies when:

The issue is capable of repetition;

It would repeatedly evade review if ordinary mootness rules were applied; and

The issue is of public importance.

The Court notes that neither party raised this exception and concludes it would not apply: while the underlying issue might recur, there is no reason to think that review would consistently be evaded in future cases.

Brause (again), and Standard Alaska Production Co. v. State, Department of Revenue, 773 P.2d 201 (Alaska 1989):

These cases articulate the ripeness doctrine:

A claim is ripe if a legal injury has occurred or is sufficiently imminent.

Court review is forbidden for “abstract disagreements” or speculative harms.

Ripeness turns on:

The fitness of the issues for judicial decision (i.e., whether the issues are clearly framed by concrete facts); and

The hardship to the parties of withholding judicial consideration.

The Court applies these ripeness principles to hold that any broad future challenge to DOC’s OTA‑copy policy is not ripe.

3. Declaratory Judgment Standards

AS 22.10.020(g) – Alaska’s Declaratory Judgment Act:

Authorizes superior courts to issue declaratory judgments, but those judgments must serve specific purposes—chiefly to:

Clarify and settle legal relations; and

Terminate and afford relief from uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy.

Forrer v. State, Department of Fish & Game, Board of Fisheries, Op. No. 7791 (Alaska Oct. 10, 2025), and Lowell v. Hayes, 117 P.3d 745 (Alaska 2005):

The Court quotes Forrer, which relies on Lowell, for the proposition that courts should decline declaratory relief when:

It does not clarify legal relations; and

It does not meaningfully remove uncertainty or controversy.

Applying this, the Court concludes that a declaration in Katchatag’s favor would not change his legal status or provide meaningful relief, given that he had already obtained the OTA statements and his appeals had proceeded.

4. Statutory and Policy Framework

AS 09.19.010(b)(2):

Requires prisoners seeking exemption from filing fees to submit specified financial information, including a certified copy of their inmate account statement.

This statute is the reason the OTA statements were necessary for Katchatag’s administrative appeals.

AS 09.19.200 – Limits on prospective relief in prisoner suits:

Governs prospective relief (i.e., injunctive or similar forward‑looking orders) in civil actions against correctional facilities.

Key features:

A court may not order prospective relief unless:

The plaintiff has proven a violation of a state or federal right; and

The plaintiff has exhausted all administrative remedies.

Both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief must be:

Narrowly drawn;

The least intrusive means necessary to correct the harm or violation; and

Not extend farther than necessary to correct the violation.

The Court uses AS 09.19.200 to reject Katchatag’s requested sweeping injunction, observing that it would impose a statewide, categorical entitlement to free, certified OTA statements for all inmates, for any purpose—far beyond the relief necessary to remedy his particular complaint.

AS 33.30.295(a):

Limits superior court jurisdiction over certain DOC decisions.

It is mentioned because one of Katchatag’s administrative appeals was ultimately dismissed for lack of subject‑matter jurisdiction under this statute, demonstrating that the delay in copies did not cause the dismissal.

D.O.C. Policy 808.12 – Photocopying for Prisoners:

Provides that indigent prisoners can be given free legal copies if the superintendent or designee:

Verifies indigency; and

Authorizes the copies at no cost.

SCCC also apparently applied an internal practice limiting inmates to one free certified six‑month OTA statement every three months.

The Court does not decide the legality or constitutionality of that policy or practice but treats them as the context for Katchatag’s complaints.

B. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

1. No Genuine Dispute of Material Fact

The first issue on appeal was whether disputed facts precluded summary judgment.

(a) Alleged prevention of filing appeals

Katchatag argued that SCCC’s refusal to provide timely free OTA statements effectively prevented him from filing his administrative appeals within the 30‑day period allowed by the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure for appeals from agency decisions. He maintained that he “was subsequently not able to file the two administrative appeals.”

The Court held that this contention was factually incorrect and did not create a genuine factual dispute. The record showed that:

SCCC eventually provided the OTA statements on April 19 after the deputy director intervened; and

Both administrative appeals were filed on April 26, and neither was finally disposed of based on untimeliness or failure to perfect the appeal.

Thus, even read in the light most favorable to Katchatag, the evidence showed only a delay, not a prevention, and no prejudice to the merits of his appeals stemming from that delay. Because a “material fact” is one on which resolution of an issue turns, and the only reasonable reading of the record is that appeals were filed and heard, no genuine dispute of material fact existed on this point.

(b) Whether the communication to the deputy director was an “appeal”

Katchatag also argued that it was inaccurate for the superior court to characterize his grievance‑related communication to the deputy director as an “appeal.” He contended there was no viable grievance appeal to the Commissioner’s Office and that, after facility screening and denial, the process was effectively over.

The Court rejected this as both factually and legally immaterial:

The document he sent was titled “Prisoner Grievance Appeal Statement” and explicitly began, “I appeal…”

Regardless of the terminology, the deputy director responded by directing SCCC to provide the copies, and SCCC complied.

Whether the communication is called an “appeal” or something else does not affect the outcome: the relief (the copies) was granted. As a result, the dispute over labeling was not a material factual dispute under Christensen.

Having found no genuine, material factual disputes, the Court proceeded to analyze whether DOC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

2. Injunctive Relief under AS 09.19.200

A core part of the Court’s reasoning involves the statutory limits on prospective relief against correctional facilities in prisoner civil actions.

Katchatag sought a broad injunction requiring DOC to:

Provide any inmate (sentenced or unsentenced);

Throughout all State of Alaska DOC facilities;

Upon request, at any time;

With a certified six‑month OTA statement; and

For both legal and non‑legal uses, apparently free of charge.

The Court sidestepped questions about whether Katchatag had in fact proved a constitutional violation and instead focused on scope and tailoring under AS 09.19.200. Even assuming a violation, AS 09.19.200 requires that:

Prospective relief must be narrowly drawn and extend no further than necessary to correct the specific harm or violation of rights; and

The relief should be the least intrusive means of remedying that specific violation.

The harm alleged by Katchatag was individual and episodic: SCCC’s failure to timely provide free OTA copies in response to his January and February requests, which he said jeopardized his ability to file two specific appeals.

Narrowly drawn relief to address such a harm might include, for example:

An order directed specifically to SCCC in relation to its handling of Katchatag’s own copy requests; or

Possibly, a modest procedural requirement to ensure that indigent prisoners’ legal copy requests are decided in a timely way where necessary to meet court deadlines.

By contrast, Katchatag’s requested injunction:

Would bind every DOC facility statewide;

Would confer an unrestricted, on‑demand right to free certified financial statements for any use (legal or non‑legal); and

Was untethered to any demonstrated pattern of harm or systemic constitutional violation.

The Court concluded that such relief is “exceedingly broad” and goes “far beyond what is necessary” to correct the alleged violation. Consequently, the injunction would violate the express limitations in AS 09.19.200(a)–(b) and could not lawfully be issued.

The opinion notes explicitly that:

Even if Katchatag had established a violation of state or federal rights, the requested prospective relief still fails the statutory “narrow tailoring” and “necessity” requirements; and

More narrowly drawn relief would in any event be barred on mootness grounds because the underlying dispute had already been resolved (he got the copies and filed the appeals).

3. Declaratory Relief: Mootness

As to declaratory relief relating to the past denial of OTA statements, the Court applied the doctrine of mootness.

Katchatag’s concrete complaint was that DOC violated his rights when SCCC refused to provide copies in January and February 2022. However:

He appealed the grievance denial to the deputy director;

DOC granted him six certified copies on April 19, 2022; and

He successfully used those copies to perfect both administrative appeals.

Thus, a judicial declaration at this point—whether favorable or not—would not alter his legal position or provide any additional remedy. Under Clark, a claim is moot where the plaintiff “would not be entitled to any relief even if he or she prevailed.” Because the immediate controversy (access to the specific OTA statements) had been resolved, no effective relief remained for the court to grant via a declaratory judgment.

The Court also briefly addressed, and rejected, the public interest exception to mootness. Although the issue (access to OTA statements for indigent inmates) might be capable of repetition, nothing indicated that it would systematically evade review in future cases. Therefore, the Court did not treat the case as an appropriate vehicle to decide broad, unsettled constitutional questions under the public interest exception.

4. Declaratory Relief: Ripeness and the Policy Challenge

Katchatag also mounted a more generalized challenge to DOC’s policy and practice—namely:

The requirement that the superintendent approve free legal copies for indigent inmates; and

SCCC’s practice of providing only one free certified six‑month OTA statement every three months.

The Court treated this as a forward‑looking constitutional attack on DOC policy and held it was not ripe for judicial resolution:

A claim is unripe where it rests on hypothetical or speculative injuries.

Here, Katchatag did not allege with specificity:

That he or other inmates would be unable to file future appeals due to the policy; or

Any concrete hardship that would result from waiting to litigate these issues until a specific harm arises (e.g., an appeal actually dismissed as untimely because of a refusal to provide timely financial statements).

In other words, Katchatag raised an “abstract disagreement” with DOC’s policy—exactly what ripeness doctrine discourages courts from adjudicating.

Moreover, the Court emphasized that even apart from mootness and ripeness, the requested declaratory judgment would not serve the statutory purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act, as elaborated in Forrer and Lowell. A declaration that DOC’s policy is or is not constitutional would not:

Clarify and settle Katchatag’s legal relations; or

Terminate or significantly reduce any present “uncertainty, insecurity, or controversy” regarding his rights, because his underlying grievance (access to statements for his two appeals) had already been resolved.

Consequently, the Court held that declaratory relief was properly denied.

C. Impact and Significance

Although designated as a memorandum opinion and explicitly non‑precedential under Alaska Appellate Rule 214(d), Katchatag illustrates several important dynamics in Alaska prisoner litigation:

1. Reinforcement of Narrow Tailoring Requirements Under AS 09.19.200

The opinion underscores that AS 09.19.200 significantly cabins the scope of injunctive relief that Alaska courts may grant in prisoner civil actions. Practically:

Prisoners seeking injunctive relief must carefully tailor their requested orders to their own demonstrated injuries or to clearly proven systemic violations.

Courts will be skeptical of broad, structural injunctions—especially those that:

Create categorical rights (e.g., unlimited free services) for all inmates statewide; or

Are not clearly tied to established constitutional or statutory violations.

Even if a plaintiff can show that their own rights were violated in a specific instance, this case illustrates that AS 09.19.200 may preclude system‑wide prospective relief absent tailored evidence of a broader, ongoing violation.

2. Practical Limits on Access‑to‑Courts Claims Where Relief Has Been Provided

The decision implicitly illustrates the concept of “actual injury” in access‑to‑courts claims: a delay or inconvenience, without a concrete adverse effect on a legal claim, will often be insufficient to sustain live injunctive or declaratory relief.

Here:

Although the delay in providing OTA copies may have created anxiety or practical difficulty, the appeals were ultimately filed and reviewed on grounds independent of timeliness.

Once DOC provided the requested copies and the appeals proceeded, no ongoing legal injury remained for the courts to remedy.

Future litigants alleging denial of access to the courts will likely need to demonstrate:

A causal connection between DOC’s conduct and a concrete harm (e.g., dismissal of a case, inability to file a claim, forfeiture of a right); and

That the harm remains remediable at the time of the lawsuit (i.e., is not moot).

3. Emphasis on Justiciability in Prisoner Cases

The Court’s reliance on mootness and ripeness doctrines signals a reluctance to resolve abstract or academic questions about DOC policies in the absence of concrete, ongoing controversies.

For practitioners, this highlights the importance of:

Pleading specific, current harms rather than generalized objections to prison policies; and

Addressing justiciability head‑on, including:

Explaining why an issue remains live despite partial or complete remedial action by DOC; and

Where appropriate, arguing the public interest exception to mootness if the issue is truly likely to evade review.

4. Declaratory Judgment as a Limited Remedy

Katchatag reinforces that declaratory judgments are not simply symbolic pronouncements of right and wrong. Under AS 22.10.020(g) and cases like Forrer and Lowell, a declaratory judgment must:

Meaningfully clarify legal relations between the parties; and

Alleviate concrete uncertainty or controversy.

Where, as here, an inmate has already received the relief that would have been the practical effect of a declaration (the OTA copies), the Court is unlikely to expend judicial resources to pronounce on whether rights were violated in the past, especially where doing so would not alter any current legal rights or responsibilities.

IV. Simplifying Key Legal Concepts

A. Summary Judgment

What it is: A procedure allowing a court to decide a case without a trial when there is no real dispute about the important facts and one party is entitled to win as a matter of law.

How it works:

The party moving for summary judgment must show:

No genuine issue of material fact exists; and

They are entitled to judgment under the law.

If they do so, the other party must provide specific evidence showing a real factual dispute—not just argument or bare assertions.

A material fact is one that could change the outcome of the case.

In Katchatag, the Court found no material disputes because the record clearly showed the appeals were filed and not prejudiced by the delays, and the characterization of the grievance communication as an “appeal” was irrelevant to the legal outcome.

B. Mootness

What it is: Mootness asks whether there is still something for the court to decide that will actually affect the parties’ rights.

A claim is moot when:

The issue has already been resolved; and

Even if the plaintiff wins, they will receive no further practical relief.

In this case, once Katchatag received the OTA statements and filed his appeals, a court order directing DOC to provide the same copies would be redundant. Therefore, the dispute over that particular denial was moot.

C. Ripeness

What it is: Ripeness prevents courts from deciding hypothetical or abstract disputes. A claim must be based on an actual or imminently threatened injury, not on speculation about what might happen in the future.

For a claim to be ripe:

The issue must be fit for judicial decision (factually developed, not abstract); and

The parties must face hardship if the court declines to decide it now.

In Katchatag, the challenge to DOC’s policy on free statements and superintendent approval was unripe because there was no concrete example of that policy currently or imminently causing legal harm after the April 2022 events.

D. Declaratory Judgments

What they are: A declaratory judgment is a court order that clarifies the rights and obligations of the parties without necessarily ordering anyone to do anything immediately.

Courts issue them to:

Settle uncertainty about legal relationships; and

Prevent future disputes or violations.

They are not intended to provide purely “symbolic” victories, especially where the plaintiff’s real‑world problem has already been remedied.

E. Prospective Relief Under AS 09.19.200

What it is: Prospective relief is forward‑looking—such as injunctions that tell prison officials how to act going forward. AS 09.19.200 governs when and how Alaska courts may order such relief in prisoner cases.

Key requirements:

The prisoner must prove a violation of state or federal rights.

The prisoner must have exhausted administrative remedies.

Any order must be:

Narrowly drawn to remedy the specific violation;

The least intrusive means necessary to fix the problem; and

Not broader or more burdensome than necessary.

This is intended to prevent courts from micromanaging prisons or imposing sweeping, system‑wide changes based on isolated incidents.

F. Access to the Courts

Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts to challenge their convictions and the conditions of their confinement. However:

This right does not guarantee unlimited resources or ideal conditions.

In Katchatag, the Court deliberately did not decide whether DOC’s behavior rose to a constitutional violation because the case could be resolved on statutory and justiciability grounds.

V. Conclusion

Raymond Katchatag v. State, Department of Corrections is a non‑precedential memorandum opinion, but it provides a clear and practical illustration of how the Alaska Supreme Court approaches prisoner litigation involving access‑to‑courts claims, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgments.

The key takeaways are:

Summary judgment discipline: Even in prisoner civil rights cases, courts will scrutinize whether alleged factual disputes are genuinely material. Assertions that are contradicted by the record (e.g., that appeals could not be filed when they in fact were filed) will not suffice to prevent summary judgment.

Strict limits on injunctive relief under AS 09.19.200: Prospective relief must be narrowly tailored to remedy a proven, concrete violation. Broad, system‑wide injunctions conferring categorical entitlements (such as unlimited free financial statements for all inmates) are unlikely to survive statutory scrutiny.

Mootness and ripeness as threshold barriers: Once a prisoner has already received the practical relief requested (access to documents, ability to file appeals), claims for injunctive or declaratory relief regarding that specific deprivation are likely moot. More generalized policy challenges must be grounded in concrete or imminent harms to be ripe.

Declaratory judgments are not advisory opinions: Courts will not issue declarations about the legality of prison policies merely to pronounce on past conduct or abstract disagreements; the declaration must clarify current legal relations and reduce real, present uncertainty or controversy.

For litigants and counsel, Katchatag serves as a practical guide: focus on demonstrable injuries; craft narrow, targeted requests for prospective relief; and carefully address the doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and statutory constraints on remedies in prisoner civil actions.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 01:56:47.694456

These changes could force more than 170,000 people back into homelessness and disrupt services in communities across the country. Pelosi’s support of all three initiatives underscores the significant stakes for San Francisco, where $55 million in federal CoC grants are central to keeping vulnerable individuals and families housed—supporting over 1,500 housing units in the Bay Area.

Pelosi signed on to three letters led by House Appropriations Committee Ranking Members Rosa DeLauro and James Clyburn, House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters, and Bay Area Congressman Sam Liccardo. Across these efforts, lawmakers raised alarms about HUD’s abrupt policy shifts, deep funding reductions for permanent supportive housing and a severely delayed FY2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) that together threaten to destabilize homelessness systems nationwide.

Appropriations Committee Letter

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ranking Member DeLauro, Rep. Clyburn and 203 House Democrats urged HUD to prevent service lapses caused by the latest NOFO. Their letter notes that the FY2025 NOFO is “the most delayed issuance of a NOFO for the CoC Program over the last 10 years,” and warns that the timing combined with major policy changes will result in “the most prolonged funding gap for this critical homelessness prevention program.”

The lawmakers highlighted that nearly $3.7 billion in FY2024 CoC grants begin expiring on December 31, 2025, raising urgent concerns that communities could face major disruptions through winter and into spring if the administration does not act.

The full letter can be read HERE.(link is external)

Financial Services Committee Letter

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Ranking Member Waters and 52 House Democrats called on HUD Secretary Scott Turner to rescind a NOFO that “could push over 170,000 formerly homeless individuals back on the streets and exacerbate our nation’s homelessness crisis.” The letter highlights that HUD’s proposal would slash permanent supportive housing from 86% of CoC funding to just 30% and impose an extremely compressed application timeline that could create a half-year gap in critical services.

The lawmakers warned that the NOFO would worsen conditions for people with disabilities, veterans, domestic violence survivors, women with children, and others already disproportionately impacted by the homelessness crisis.

Rep. Liccardo Letter

Speaker Emerita Pelosi, Rep. Sam Liccardo, and more than 30 House Democrats pressed HUD for answers on the Administration’s decision to cut billions from permanent supportive housing services in the CoC Program. The Liccardo-led effort notes that these cuts put 170,000 Americans at risk of homelessness, and emphasized that eliminating support without any transition plan would cause immediate disruption in cities that rely heavily on CoC investments to reduce homelessness.",http://pelosi.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pelosi.house.gov/files/featured_image/Speaker%20Emerita%20Full%20Screen.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 15:57:18.033816

Elaine Miles, an Indigenous actor, alleges that she was stopped by four masked men while she was walking to a bus stop in Redmond.
It’s not fake!” Miles’ account chimes with others of Native Americans being swept up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Galanda said that the prospect of Native Americans being detained is reminiscent of the country’s troubled history with Indigenous peoples.","A Native American actor known for her role in Northern Exposure has said she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Seattle, Washington, who told her that her tribal identification “looked fake”.

Elaine Miles, an Indigenous actor, alleges that she was stopped by four masked men while she was walking to a bus stop in Redmond. She offered them her ID card from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon but was told by an ICE agent that “anyone can make that.”

Miles, who also appeared in The Last of Us, Smoke Signals, The Business of Fancydancing and Skins, told the ICE agents to call the tribal enrollment office number on the card.

According to a report of the encounter by the Seattle Times, the officers refused. Miles called the office herself, whereupon one officer tried to take her phone but failed. Then the men released her and departed in their vehicles.

Miles alleges that a similar thing has happened to her son and uncle – they have previously been detained and later released by ICE officers who would not initially accept their tribal identification.

According to a post on Facebook by the Lakota People’s Law Project, Miles told the group: “Tribal IDs—the government issued those damn cards to us like a pedigree dog! It’s not fake!”

Miles’ account chimes with others of Native Americans being swept up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Native News Online reports that an Indigenous woman born in Phoenix was mistakenly detained by immigration authorities after being released from jail in Des Moines, Iowa.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda told the Seattle newspaper. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

Galanda said that the agents’ refusal to accept Miles’ ID points to “a fair amount of ignorance about tribal citizenship generally in society and in government”.

According to the outlet, the actor’s encounter with ICE agents came on the same day that ICE agents made several arrests at Redmond’s Bear Creek Village shopping center, prompting city council to switch off its license-plate-reading cameras.

Earlier this year, the Navajo nation announced it was taking steps to protect its community from federal immigration actions, amid reports that some Indigenous Americans have been swept up in US deportation raids.

After Miles was detained, she said she was now afraid to leave the house alone or at night. Galanda said that the prospect of Native Americans being detained is reminiscent of the country’s troubled history with Indigenous peoples.

“It’s also deeply troubling that in 2025, the first people of this country have to essentially look over their shoulders,” she added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5728b35ac509c9dc0befd138c07d893636706c39/0_161_6000_4798/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46ab44c43185c83dd987519f69c0e45d",N,,2025-11-28 15:57:29.262859

Politico's reporting on Friday concerned a policy Trump instituted back in July, calling for all individuals facing deportation proceedings to be jailed without the possibility of seeking a release. Though the Trump administration has defended its crackdown by claiming that it is being applied to dangerous and violent criminals, Politico noted that many of the immigrants targeted by this new policy ""have lived in the U.S. for years, and sometimes decades, without incident and have been pursuing asylum or other forms of legal status.""

The response to this rule sparked a ""tidal wave of emergency lawsuits"" claiming it violated immigration laws and immigrants' due-process rights. As of Friday morning, when its piece was published, Politico found that in an overwhelming percentage of these lawsuits, judges ruled against Trump's policy, with a good number of them being judges he himself appointed.

At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration’s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process,"" the report explained. ""Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents — including 23 by Trump himself — and hail from at least 35 states, according to a Politico analysis of thousands of recent cases.""

The rate at which legal opposition to Trump's immigrant detention policy has grown is also considerable, with the number of judges who have ruled against the administration doubling in just the last month.

The scale of the push back feels even greater when considering the inverse: Politico found that only eight judges in the entire country, six of whom were Trump appointees, ruled in favor of the administration's position.

Judges have also grown ""exasperated"" by the volume of litigation flowing into their courts as a result of Trump's policy, making it difficult for them to keep up.

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, a federal judge in California originally appointed by Bill Clinton, said in a comment from last week.

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, and the Spanish Foreign Minister, José Manuel Albares, chose not to respond on Friday to the words of US President Donald Trump, in which he announced his intention to “permanently” suspend the entry of migrants “from all Third World countries” and to expel “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

“Immigration policies are a prerogative of each country, so, as far as we know, one thing is the declaration and another will be the legislative proposals. We’ll see what happens,” Kallas declared in Barcelona during the closing press conference of the tenth Regional Forum of the Union for the Mediterranean, held at the Pedralbes Palace in Barcelona.

“Certainly, when you look at the figures year after year, thanks to the cooperation with some of our friends who were here today—Morocco, Mauritania, to name the most important—the entry route for irregular immigration to Spain is the lowest in the entire European Union,” he added.

In a message posted on social media to mark Thanksgiving in the United States, Trump lashed out at “American Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain stupid, when it comes to Immigration.”

“The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels,” he claimed.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” the US president asserted.

For all these reasons, the President of the United States announced his intention to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,” to end “the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and to remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

“I will end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” he added. “Happy Thanksgiving to all, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!” he concluded.",https://thediplomatinspain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donald-trump-2-1140x570-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:57:38.332554

Trump offered no details on how he would implement these policies or what he considers a “third world” country, an ill-defined and often offensive term for developing nations. Congress for years has failed to pass major immigration reforms, and courts have blocked some of his previous executive orders limiting immigration.

Article content

Earlier in the day, the president had announced the death of one of the guardsman, U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20. The attack by an Afghan national on the eve of Thanksgiving holiday has led Trump to amplify his anti-immigration policies.

Article content

Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.” He added that he would terminate millions of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

Article content

After the shooting, the White House halted Afghan immigration proceedings and ordered a review of those already in the U.S. The administration had already planned to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden and freeze their green card applications, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg this month.

The administration has sharply reduced the refugee admissions cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a US$100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by tech companies and universities, and revoked thousands of visas. It is also challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

Suspect to face upgraded charges of murder in the first degree, says US attorney for DC

Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, this morning announced that charges against the suspected shooter were being upgraded.

Pirro told Fox News on Friday morning: “There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree.

“And we are hoping that the more information we can get and the more investigation that is going on 24/7 now, around the clock in Washington, the more we will find out about what actually happened in terms of this individual even being in this country and being in a position to ambush and shoot down an innocent young woman who was doing her duty to the people of this country.”

West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito on Thursday defended the deployment of National Guard troops from her state to Washington, DC.

Capito, a Republican, told Fox News that crime in the city had declined and questioned whether Democratic lawmakers criticizing former President Donald Trump’s decision to send troops to Washington had spoken with Guard members on the ground.

The two Guard members shot on Wednesday had been assigned to duty in Washington since August, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey deployed the troops at Trump’s request.

West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey reaffirmed his support for the state’s National Guard members deployed in Washington, DC.

“When you have these terrorists, when you have these evildoers, you’re not going to back down when they go after our servicemen and women,” Morrisey, a Republican, told CNN.

He said pulling back the Guard’s mission would amount to yielding to those responsible for the attack.

“The last thing we should do is reverse course and let the bad guys win,” he said, calling the perpetrators individuals who had “violated every law and societal norm.”

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he was “devastated” by the death of Sarah Beckstrom.

In a post on X, he asked followers to take a moment to think of those “who have been plunged into unimaginable grief”.

The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief David Smith wrote this analysis after the shooting earlier this week:

“Washington DC is considered a safe zone,” Donald Trump declared on Tuesday, veering off topic at the national Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House. “This was one of the most unsafe places anywhere in the United States. It is now considered a totally safe city.”

A day later, two national guardsmen from West Virginia were shot in a busy area a few blocks from the White House in downtown Washington. The ambush took place outside the Farragut West Metro railway station within sight of the Guardian’s office (I had been in the station three hours earlier and witnessed national guard troops milling around).

In a speech from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday evening, Trump said the suspect entered the US from Afghanistan in 2021. For the president it was a political opportunity and he was determined to exploit it. Immigration? Check. Law and order? Check. All Joe Biden’s fault? Check.

Trump accused his predecessor of allowing millions of violent criminals into the US and launched a xenophobic attack on Somalis in Minnesota: “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country, and ripping apart that once great state.” Notably, the previous evening, his aide Stephen Miller had decried “the Somalification of America”, telling Fox News: “Look how powerful the Democrat Party became in Minnesota once they flooded it with 100,000 Somalians!”

Then Trump announced a review of the status Afghan nationals in the US. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”

Raising the spectre of a newly aggressive crackdown by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the remarks came as little surprise from a president who has made illegal immigration central to his political identity. The White House regularly sends out lists and images of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes and could not resist playing up the suspect’s nationality.

Trump was elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration and his second term has been characterized by a campaign of mass deportations.

Construction sites and schools have been frequent targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America’s foreign-born workers account for nearly 31m jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump’s late-night Truth Social post was full of anti-immigrant invective.

The president blamed immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION”.

Trump’s threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.

The president asserted without evidence that millions of people born outside the US and now living there were to blame for America’s societal ills.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”

One of two US national guard soldiers shot in a targeted attack near the White House this week has died, while the second is fighting for his life, Donald Trump has announced.

As part of his Thanksgiving call to US troops late on Thursday, the US president said he had been informed that Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had succumbed to her wounds.

“Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we’re talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person … She’s just passed away. She’s no longer with us,” Trump said in his first live remarks since the shooting on Wednesday.

Trump added that the second guard member, Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life”.

Beckstrom’s father had told the New York Times in a phone call earlier in the day that his daughter was unlikely to recover. “I’m holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom said. “She has a mortal wound. It’s not going to be a recovery.”

Trump steps up immigration crackdown after national guard member dies in DC attack

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries,” a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that has become a political flashpoint in the president’s ongoing crackdown on immigration.

In a social media post beginning with “a very happy Thanksgiving,” sent after 11pm on Thursday, the US president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”.

It as not clear how the president would enact such a “pause” in migration. Previous bans issued by his administration have faced challenges in the courts and in Congress.

Earlier in the night, Trump announced the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday. Authorities suspect the shooting was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021 under a Biden-era programme that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands from Afghanistan after the chaotic US withdrawal from the country.

The extended rant came in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C., under Trump's orders on Wednesday.

A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan is facing charges for the shooting, which will likely be upgraded after the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom of the West Virginia National Guard.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrissey paid tribute to Beckstrom.

""Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation,"" said Morrissey. ""She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard.""

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of driving across the country to Washington in what officials described as an ""ambush."" Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition with unspecified injuries from the attack.

The suspect, currently in custody, was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening. He emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Refugee groups fear backlash

Hours before Trump took to social media, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 ""high-risk"" countries ""to the maximum degree possible.""

Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns. Afghanistan was among those countries.Trump, who began his social media post by extending Thanksgiving greetings to ""all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots,"" said that even as the U.S. has ""progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many,"" detailing a list of claims about the effects of migration on employment and crime that have long been disputed.

""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,"" Trump said.

Trump cited the example of Somalians who have settled in Minnesota, seizing on a case of alleged COVID-19 fraud involving a Somalian-American group. In the process, the president used a slur for mentally disabled people to describe Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz.

Earlier Thursday, Trump met with reporters at his Florida estate. Asked by a reporter on Thursday if he blamed the shootings on all Afghans who came to the U.S., Trump said: ""No, but we've had a lot of problems with Afghans,"" without elaborating.

It was not not clear what mechanisms the White House might employ to fulfil Trump's stated objectives concerning clamping down on migration to the U.S.

Even before Trump's social media posts, groups that work with refugees worried about a backlash from the shooting incident.

""Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status … we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics,"" Matthew Soerens, a vice-president with World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that helps settle refugees, told The Associated Press.

Ashraf Haidari, founder and president of Displaced International, which provides resources, advocacy and support to displaced people worldwide, told The Associated Press, ""even as we pursue accountability, one individual’s alleged actions cannot be allowed to define, burden, or endanger entire communities who had no part in this tragedy.""

Ratcheting up anti-migration policies

In his second presidential term, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. The administration promised to focus on those with criminal records and those accused of violence, but many law-abiding residents and even U.S. citizens have occasionally been confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Control (CBP).

Several judges have assailed the administration for not appearing to afford due process to those facing deportation. Some who had never been convicted of a crime in the U.S. were deported straight to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

In August, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security urged Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients to leave, saying these U.S. residents who arrived from foreign countries as children don't enjoy ""any form of legal status in this country.""

The DHS spokesperson used the term ""self-deport,"" a term connected to a fraught history.

The Trump administration also wants to end birthright citizenship. Courts have blocked that bid, but the matter could be brought before the Supreme Court.

On the campaign trail that capped his remarkable political comeback, Trump said migrants were ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Both Trump and Republicans have assailed what they say were lax border policies of Joe Biden's administration, as the U.S. saw an increase in border encounters between 2021 and mid-2024.

But the picture is more complex than the Republicans portray, think-tanks including the libertarian Cato Institute say.

The Biden administration encouraged more asylum claims from outside the country and developed an app for migrants that has been discontinued.

The Biden administration also moved to end Title 42 — a pandemic health measure that had the unintended consequence of encouraging some migrants to make repeat attempts to cross — but the end of the measure did not occur until mid-2023, a year later than planned, as over 20 attorney generals from Republican-led states challenged the move.

Trump's first term as president included several divisive and controversial incidents on the immigration file. That Trump administration in its first week spurred chaos at the nation's airports by announcing a travel ban from Muslim-majority countries, which was met with successful legal challenges until the White House revised the order.

In a departure from precedent, the first Trump administration separated many migrant children from their families arriving at southern border points, and failed to properly track the whereabouts of hundreds of children. That failure, a report later found, was an inevitable outcome of the relevant federal government agencies using different computer systems.

Trump in 2019 also lashed out at four Democratic members of Congress, all women, saying they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Three of the four women were born in the U.S. and the other, Somalian-American Ilhan Omar, became a naturalized citizen while a teenager in 2000.

On Friday, UN agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country.

Lopez Belloza is a business major at Babson College. “I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” she said in an interview with The Boston Globe from her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. “I’m losing everything.”

Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S., in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard troop Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.

Officials have said that Wednesday’s attack on two troops was carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America's global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

It was not clear exactly which countries he was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.

The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum seekers.

The president also threatened to ""end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country"" and to ""denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.""

In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was ""non-compatible with Western Civilization.""

He added: ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would reexamine the status of Green Card holders from 19 countries ""of concern,"" including Afghanistan.

In a subsequent post, Trump said that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Somali migrants were ""completely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.""

Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protective status — which prevents deportations to dangerous countries — for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the east African country.

It's unclear how many people this would affect but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walk as ""retarded"" and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, who was born in Somalia, ""probably came into the U.S.A. illegally"" and is from a ""decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.""

Trump's threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban's legality.

Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.

""Using this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,"" the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: “When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

The term ""third world"" originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn't aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.

The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-government-shutdown-mn-1100-efa96e.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 10:57:47.177714

As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement set off a tidal wave of emergency lawsuits July 8 with a policy change that led to their targets being arrested at workplaces, courthouses and immigration check-ins, and at least 225 judges in more than 700 cases have ruled against President Donald Trump's administration – compared with just eight who sided with the new mass detention policy, reported Politico.

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” wrote U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, in a Nov. 21 ruling.

Judges have noted the sheer volume of rulings against the administration in their rulings, which reflects their growing exasperation with the litigation prompted by a policy that has been rejected over and over as unlawful.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill in a Nov. 19 ruling that released 17 people arrested during an ICE raid at a racetrack. “This court joins the overwhelming majority.”

There have been few broad attempts to block the ICE policy, but judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have recently certified class action lawsuits to challenge the detentions, and a California judge approved a nationwide class Tuesday that could immediately force the administration to provide bond hearings for detainees.

The Trump administration expressed confidence that appeals courts, and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, would uphold the policy, saying they were forced to impose the detentions in response to Biden-era policies.

In two Truth Social posts, he wrote that he would stop migration from “all Third World Countries” to enable “the U.S. system to fully recover.” He did not elaborate on which countries he meant or how he would achieve his aim.

Since the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, the Trump administration has issued a series of announcements tightening the immigration system, including pausing immigration from Afghanistan specifically.

Thursday night’s posts also seemed to target migrants who had become citizens. Mr. Trump said he would “denaturalize” migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity” and remove people from the country who were “non-compatible with Western Civilization,” without detailing whom it would apply to or how.

Hours before the posts were published, Mr. Trump announced the death of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, one of the National Guard members who was shot on Wednesday. The other victim was identified as Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who officials said on Thursday was in critical condition.

Both victims had been deployed to Washington since August as part of what the Trump administration has described as a crackdown on crime.

The suspect in the shooting, whom officials identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was in custody after being shot by other National Guard soldiers during the attack. The authorities said he had driven from Washington State to carry out the attack.

Mr. Lakanwal was once part of a C.I.A.-backed paramilitary group working in Afghanistan and moved to the United States under a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule.

On Thursday, after Mr. Lakanwal was identified as the suspect, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced new guidance introducing more “negative factors” for officials to consider in immigration cases of people from 19 countries. The change in guidance was under consideration before the shooting.

The administration said it would also re-examine “every Green Card” for immigrants from those 19 countries, which are subject to a travel ban enacted in June.

In the Thursday night social media posts, Mr. Trump singled out refugees from Somalia, who he claimed, without offering evidence, were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

US regulators ‘taking seriously’ allegations of bankers’ support for Epstein

US regulators say they are taking “very seriously” allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity, as they faced calls to investigate executives, including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

What has Warren said about Staley? She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.

Rescue efforts end at Hong Kong tower block fire as death toll reaches 128

The death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire that began on Wednesday has risen to 128, with about 200 missing, officials have said, as rescue efforts ended.

Fire crews combed the complex for survivors after the blaze swept through seven of its eight towers in one of the city’s deadliest fires. The inferno at the site, which housed more than 4,600 people, began during building renovations. The authorities said they believed a highly flammable styrofoam found in every elevator window fuelled the intensity of the fire.

What do we know about the missing people? About 200 people remain unaccounted for, including 89 unidentified bodies. Officials said the fire was extinguished but they needed to wait for the towers to cool before entering, as some areas remained above 392F (200C). Investigators estimate it will take three to four weeks to gather the evidence.

Stat of the day: Consuming political content on X for a week increases polarization by a degree that would have previously taken three years

Small tweaks to the tone of the political content fed to users of X over one week can drive political polarization by an amount that would have historically taken at least three years, research has found. An experiment to measure the power of Elon Musk’s platform to drive division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were slightly boosted, Democrats and Republicans experienced a significant increase in their unfavourable feelings towards the other.

This guidance comes after the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan and the entry of Afghan nationals in its first year of office.

“My primary responsibility is to ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This includes an assessment of where they are coming from and why. Yesterday’s horrific events make it abundantly clear the Biden administration spent the last four years dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens. The Trump administration takes the opposite approach. Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests. American lives come first.”

The updated guidance, including consideration of country-specific factors such as a country’s ability to issue secure identity documents, will further strengthen USCIS’ implementation of President Trump’s Presidential Proclamation (PP) 10949, Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats. It will allow USCIS officers to more meaningfully assess whether an alien is a threat to public safety and national security.

This policy guidance is effective immediately and applies to requests pending or filed on or after Nov. 27, 2025.

Vermont is one of 22 states arguing that the U.S. Department of Agriculture violated federal law in how it implemented changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, targets USDA guidance issued on October 31, 2025, that the states say wrongly strips food benefits from refugees, asylees, and other immigrants who entered the country through humanitarian pathways. The Vermont Attorney General’s Office announced the legal action in coordination with attorneys general from states including New York, California, Massachusetts, and Michigan.

What Is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

The dispute stems from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping federal law enacted on July 4, 2025, through the budget reconciliation process. The law, officially designated as H.R. 1, made substantial changes to federal spending programs, including new restrictions on which non-citizens can receive SNAP benefits. The law’s text limits SNAP eligibility to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents (green card holders), Cuban and Haitian entrants, and citizens of nations with Compact of Free Association agreements with the United States.

A key provision of the law requires lawful permanent residents to wait five years after obtaining their green card before becoming eligible for SNAP. The law also introduced what it calls the “State Quality Control Incentive,” which penalizes states financially if their error rates in distributing benefits exceed certain thresholds. According to analysis by Holland & Knight, states with error rates above 6% could become liable for 15% to 20% of benefit costs—expenses the federal government has historically covered entirely.

What the States Are Arguing

The Refugee Eligibility Question

The core of the lawsuit involves how the USDA interprets the law’s effect on refugees and asylees. Under a 1996 federal law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, refugees and asylees were explicitly exempted from the five-year waiting period for SNAP benefits. That exemption, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1612, has allowed refugees to receive food assistance immediately upon arrival and to continue receiving it after they adjust to lawful permanent resident status, as they are required to do after one year in the country.

The states argue that this exemption remains in effect because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not explicitly repeal it. According to the complaint filed by New York and other states, the USDA’s October guidance omits “former refugees” from the list of individuals exempt from the five-year bar. This omission, the states contend, effectively rewrites federal law through agency guidance rather than congressional action.

The practical effect of the USDA’s interpretation is significant. Under the agency’s reading, a refugee who has lived legally in the United States for one year and then obtains a green card—as required by law—would lose SNAP eligibility for four additional years. The National Immigration Law Center has described this as creating a perverse incentive where gaining permanent legal status results in loss of food assistance.

The Timeline Problem

The lawsuit also challenges the USDA’s implementation timeline as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Federal regulations at 7 CFR § 275.12 provide states with a 120-day grace period after new rules take effect, during which errors in benefit calculations are not counted against them. This grace period exists because implementing complex eligibility changes requires states to update computer systems, retrain caseworkers, and notify affected recipients.

The USDA’s implementation memorandum, issued October 31, 2025, declared that the grace period had already expired as of November 1—meaning states had effectively one day’s notice. The USDA guidance document asserts that because the law was enacted July 4, the 120-day period ran from that date rather than from when the agency issued its detailed instructions.

The states argue this interpretation is “impossible under USDA’s own regulations.” Without guidance on who qualifies under the new rules, state agencies could not program their eligibility systems or train staff. The late issuance of guidance coupled with the retroactive expiration of the grace period, the states contend, guarantees that errors will occur—triggering the law’s new financial penalties.

Financial Stakes for Vermont

Vermont’s 3SquaresVT program distributes approximately $151 million in food benefits annually, according to Seven Days. Under the new penalty structure, if Vermont’s error rate exceeds 6%, the state could become responsible for 15% of benefit costs—potentially more than $22 million annually.

Larger states face proportionally larger exposure. New York, which distributes $7.35 billion in SNAP benefits, could face penalties exceeding $1 billion annually according to the New York Attorney General’s complaint. Massachusetts has estimated potential penalties of $131 million to $394 million annually based on current error rates, according to state government updates.

The states describe being placed in what the Vermont Attorney General’s office calls an “impossible position”: either terminate benefits for recipients who may be legally eligible under federal statute, or continue providing benefits and risk substantial financial penalties if courts ultimately uphold the USDA’s interpretation.

Related Legal Actions

This lawsuit is one of several legal challenges to federal SNAP policy currently proceeding through federal courts. Earlier in November, New York Attorney General Letitia James obtained a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from attempting to claw back SNAP benefits during a federal government shutdown. That order remains in effect while related litigation continues.

The District of Columbia Attorney General has also filed suit to protect SNAP benefits, noting that more than 320 small retailers in the District depend on SNAP revenue. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced her state’s participation in the coalition lawsuit the same day Vermont filed.

What the Law Says

The legal dispute turns on a principle of statutory interpretation known as the “canon against implied repeal.” Under this doctrine, courts presume that when Congress passes a new law, it does not automatically override previous laws unless it explicitly says so or the two laws directly contradict each other.

The states argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the 1996 refugee exemption can coexist: the new law defines who qualifies as a lawful permanent resident, while the older law specifies that refugees who become permanent residents remain exempt from the waiting period. Because the new law does not mention or repeal the 1996 exemption, the states contend it remains valid law.

The USDA’s position, as reflected in its guidance, appears to treat the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a comprehensive restatement of non-citizen eligibility that supersedes previous frameworks. The Church World Service, a refugee resettlement organization, has published analysis noting that if the USDA’s interpretation is upheld, it would represent a significant departure from 30 years of policy treating refugees as exempt from waiting periods for public benefits.

What Happens Next

The coalition of state attorneys general is seeking an injunction to block the USDA guidance from taking effect while the case proceeds. If a court grants preliminary relief, states would be able to continue administering SNAP under the previous rules while the underlying legal questions are resolved.

The case could take months or longer to resolve at the district court level, with appeals likely regardless of the outcome. If the states prevail, the USDA would be required to issue new guidance consistent with the court’s interpretation of the law. If the federal government prevails, states would need to implement the eligibility restrictions as the USDA directs or face the financial penalties established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

A final resolution of the statutory conflict between the 2025 law and the 1996 refugee exemption may ultimately require either a Supreme Court ruling or a technical correction from Congress. Until then, the question of whether refugees who become lawful permanent residents retain their food assistance eligibility remains legally contested.

After less than a year spent destroying the federal government, sending troops into Democratic-led cities, violating the rights of immigrants and trying to rig the 2026 elections, momentum is no longer on his side.

The Supreme Court appears poised to axe Trump’s flagship tariffs. His domestic troop deployments and political prosecutions are on shaky legal footing. His plan to gerrymander his way to a GOP victory in the midterms may be backfiring. And his efforts to suppress the Epstein files failed when his usually compliant Republican Party pushed back.

Even Trump’s relationship with the public is fraying. After much talk about the cost of groceries — an “old-fashioned,” “beautiful” word that the president once defined as “a bag with different things in it” — Americans have grown tired of waiting for prices to drop. Instead, it’s Trump’s polling numbers that are falling.

This year, the only ones in the administration having a good Thanksgiving may be Waddle and Gobble, the two turkeys Trump pardoned earlier this week.

The harder they come…

Trump burst into 2025 full throttle. After taking the oath of office in January, he effectively declared war on the federal government, firing civil servants and upending foreign aid as we know it.

The president sought to rapidly change the country and its government largely through decree. In his first 100 days, he signed 142 executive orders or memorandums — more than any other president in U.S. history.

His aim was to reinterpret the Constitution, vastly expand the executive branch’s power over federal elections and cleave full departments from the federal government without congressional approval.

Under the sway of Stephen Miller and other immigration hardliners, the new administration moved quickly to conduct “mass deportations.”

Across the country, masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have detained tens of thousands of people. Despite promises to arrest violent criminals and drug cartels, Trump’s immigration crackdowns have primarily targeted ordinary undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.

The administration has also run roughshod over due process. In March, the U.S. agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison hundreds of people — without trial — in its notorious Terrorism Confinement Center. Its illegal removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran asylum seeker, became a prominent early example of the Trump administration’s egregious human rights violations.

In June, Trump began to federalize National Guard troops for deployment in major Democratic-led cities, an attempt to integrate the military into routine policing.

That same month, the president moved to secure Republican control over the country for years to come: He urged Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional districts and engineer a GOP advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. Several states — Texas, North Carolina, Missouri — scrambled to answer the president’s call.

Taking another page out of the authoritarian playbook, Trump also went after his political opponents.

In September, he ousted the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and appointed his ally Lindsey Halligan to the role. She quickly pressed charges against former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two of the president’s longtime perceived enemies.

…the harder they fall

At the worst moments this year, Trump appeared poised to rewrite American governance and engineer a long-term electoral advantage for his party. But over the past several months, his attack on American democracy has encountered a string of setbacks and outright defeats.

The administration is currently tied up in hundreds of court cases over its most extreme actions. Its aggressive immigration raids have provoked intense pushback in cities like Chicago, Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

Some states — Kansas, New Hampshire, and, initially, Indiana — balked at his calls to gerrymander.

Perhaps most importantly, courts have started to hand down rulings blocking and delaying some of Trump’s most egregious actions and executive orders. Those decisions have been particularly important for slowing Trump’s unprecedented drive for nationwide mid-decade partisan redistricting.

Earlier this month, in a case that predated Trump’s redistricting war, a judge in Utah ruled that a gerrymandered congressional map passed by the Republican-controlled legislature violated a voter-approved constitutional amendment forbidding partisan gerrymanders. She ordered the state to adopt a more fair one. Under this new map, Utah Democrats will have a good shot at winning one of the state’s four congressional seats.

A week later, a panel of three federal judges blocked* Texas from using a new gerrymandered map in the 2026 election. In a scathing opinion, Judge Jeffrey Brown — a Trump appointee, no less — wrote that the map likely represented an illegal racial gerrymander.

That ruling was particularly monumental because the Lone Star State’s decision to redistrict and give Republicans five more safe Congressional seats had set off a gerrymandering arms race across the country.

In direct response to the Texas gerrymander, California legislators decided that they too needed to redraw their map to cancel out Texas’ five new GOP seats. Under state law, they were required to get the voters’ approval. During the Nov. 4 elections — which saw Democrats sweep the polls, winning gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey — California voters overwhelmingly approved their plan. And Virginia is also moving to redraw its congressional map.

After Texas’ loss in court, it appears Trump’s redistricting efforts could be backfiring.

Trump is also losing his battles to send in the military for policing. The Supreme Court is currently considering a technical question about the precise language of the archaic statute Trump used to federalize thousands of National Guard troops for domestic deployments. That suggests justices may issue a ruling that will undermine most of these deployments.

Even those launched under other laws appear to be at risk. On Nov. 18, a Tennessee state judge found that a group of local officials challenging Gov. Bill Lee’s (R) decision to deploy Guard troops to Memphis at Trump’s urging would likely succeed in arguing it violated state law.

Two days later, a federal court rejected Trump’s assertion that he had the right to independently mobilize the D.C. National Guard for routine police work. Instead, the judge found that the deployment of more than 2,000 Guard troops to Washington was unlawful and violated the District’s right to govern itself.

His political prosecutions are also failing. On Monday, a federal judge dismissed without prejudice the DOJ’s cases against Comey and James after finding that Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi circumvented vacancy laws in appointing Halligan.

The judge ruled that Halligan was serving unlawfully when she sought indictments against Comey and James — making her the fourth Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney determined to be illegitimate.

Because the statute of limitations on the charges against Comey had expired, the DOJ is unlikely to be able to resurrect its case against him.

That ruling was not just a loss for Trump, but also an embarrassment. Just days earlier, the DOJ admitted that Halligan — an insurance lawyer who had never before prosecuted a case — never actually presented the final indictment used to charge Comey to the grand jury, a revelation that likely made the charges void.

It’s not over yet

Of course, we’re not anywhere near the finish line yet. The midterms are still a year away, and Trump has three more years in office.

There’s still a lot that he and his allies can do to gerrymander up a congressional majority in 2026 and exact retribution on his foes. And that process is already underway.

After the Republican-controlled Missouri legislature redrew its congressional maps at Trump’s behest, voting rights activists started gathering signatures to organize a state-wide referendum on the gerrymander and let voters decide.

Republicans — including the national Republican National Committee — are fighting tooth and nail to prevent the Missouri voters from having their say. They’re trying to disqualify thousands of signatures, sending out threatening mass text messages, and challenging voters’ very right to override the state legislature. Missouri voters* are also fighting back in court — they’ve filed multiple lawsuits arguing mid-decade redistricting violates the state constitution.

After the federal judges rejected Texas’ illegal racial gerrymander, the state appealed. The Supreme Court may soon overturn the lower court’s decision and let Texas use the new map in 2026 — and potentially earn the GOP five more congressional seats. Republicans are also seeking to block California’s new map.

And while Trump’s political prosecutions may be faltering, the administration appears to have a lot more in the works. John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor turned frequent critic, is under indictment.

The administration is slinging allegations of mortgage fraud at numerous prominent Democrats and Trump foes. There are signs that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida may be preparing to open a special grand jury criminal investigation against officials who have attempted to hold Trump accountable over the past decade.

And the DOJ is targeting other Democratic lawmakers and critics, including six members of Congress who recently reminded soldiers that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders.

But, for the moment, the administration’s court losses are piling up. Some of its designs on American democracy are hitting a multitude of obstacles — chief among them public opinion.

Despite his claims of record-high approval ratings, Trump’s actions over the past 10 months have angered a majority of the American public. Aggregate polling numbers indicate that, since turning negative in March, Trump’s numbers continue to nosedive.

Large-scale protests across the country only emphasize his unpopularity. In fact, the nationwide No Kings demonstrations on Oct. 19 were likely the country’s largest single-day protest ever.

The battle isn’t over. But, this Thanksgiving, the only thing Trump may be gobble-gobbling is a heaping plate of defeats.

We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.","SAN ANTONIO — When Immigration and Customs Enforcement came calling on Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux months ago to ask his officers to assist in supporting President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration enforcement operations, the chief of police in the third-largest city in this very red state said no.

On the other hand, in Texas’ largest city, Houston Mayor John Whitmire, a Democrat, has been under fire from residents and officials since he was quoted in the Houston Chronicle acknowledging some cooperation with ICE. The police department there has no formal agreement with the agency, but calls from the city’s police force to ICE, mostly as result of traffic stops, have risen 1000% since President Donald Trump was re-elected, the Houston Chronicle reported based on public records.

The approaches in Dallas and Houston show the quandary some police departments face as they weigh their cities’ public safety priorities against the Trump administration’s pressures to multiply its enforcement forces. Texas’ largest cities, where the majority of its Black and Hispanic populations are concentrated, face a tough choice: partner with ICE and risk blowback from their own communities or take a pass and risk seeing the administration send ICE, Border Patrol or National Guard troops to their cities. Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, chose the latter option, only to see federal immigration enforcement arrive on their streets.

Texas Republican lawmakers and the governor have generally sided with helping the Trump administration by passing laws that require cooperation. Sheriffs’ offices in Texas counties with populations of more than 100,000 are required by law to sign an agreement with ICE by December 2026. Texas’ Department of Public Safety, which includes highway troopers, has also signed an agreement with ICE.

Sheriffs’ offices and other law enforcement departments around the country, including in cities like Las Vegas and Miami, are signing up with unprecedented speed to a decades-old program to partner with ICE, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that has surveyed departments about the partnerships over the years.

A spokesperson frofor m the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement: “ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country. ... We encourage all state and local law enforcement agencies to become a 287(g) partner and join us in the fight to make America safe again.”

Nonetheless, none of the police departments of the top 10 U.S. cities, which include Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, have signed on as partners with ICE, according to a list the agency posts on its website.

In many cases, not cooperating comes with turning down money that is being offered to local and state law enforcement agencies as an incentive, said Muzaffar Chishti, who directs the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute.

“What has added a whole new wrinkle to this is money, which has placed more and more pressure on ICE officers and these 287(g) officers to arrest and detain more people,” he said. The 287(g) program, whose use has ebbed and flowed under different administrations, gives immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies.

DHS said its program includes reimbursements for each 287(g)-trained officer’s annual salary and benefits, as well as a percentage of their overtime. Local law enforcement agencies would also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards.

Comeaux said ICE had offered Dallas up to $25 million in reimbursement for partnering with it.

But he decided, and a joint City Council committee affirmed in a Nov. 6 meeting, that pulling police officers from their current duties and putting them on immigration enforcement arrests would be detrimental to what so far is a trend of lower homicide rates, lower violent crime, fewer traffic deaths and improved police response times, according to Comeaux. The committee voted against partnering.

“It will not make Dallas any safer, because we are aggressively going after those who are committing violent crimes already,” Comeaux said at the time, “so this program would not help us in any kind of way.”

In a statement, Comeaux repeated that he turned down an offer of $25 million from ICE because it would not have covered overtime costs and officers would be reassigned under federal oversight, which could negatively affect response times and erode public trust.

Although the Dallas Police Department does not partner with ICE, the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office does notify it about immigrants in its custody who may have immigration violations. An ICE field office in Dallas that serves North Texas and Oklahoma was the site of a shooting in September, in which two people who were detained were killed and a third was wounded.

Things have been less clear in Houston, where Whitmire, the mayor, has come under fire locally following his statement about cooperating with ICE. In March, Houston officers were directed to contact immigration authorities when they encountered anyone with a deportation order ICE listed in a national database. Whitmire sought to clarify his comments amid uproar in the city, which has a high immigrant population.

“We are the Houston Police Department. We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.

The department has had to defend its calls to ICE, including one in April when it alerted ICE about a woman from El Salvador after she had dialed 911 to report domestic abuse.

The Houston Police Department said in a statement that it does not ask about immigration status but that officers are “required to contact the issuing agency when they encounter a person with a warrant. After verifying the warrant with ICE, the officer detains the individual and transfers custody to an ICE agent.”

Whitmire’s office said in a statement that while immigration matters fall under federal jurisdiction, “anyone who breaks the law in the City of Houston will be held accountable. When police encounter an individual with an outstanding warrant from another law enforcement agency, they are required to notify that agency.”

ICE has added hundreds of thousands of administrative warrants — which are for civil violations and are not signed by judges — to the National Crime Information Center database, which police officers use to check for warrants when they pull someone over for a traffic stop.

The president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, Douglas Griffith, told NPR that the warrants are showing up in the database and that “if they pop up with a warrant, then we have no alternative but to take those people into custody.”

But ICE officials who spoke at the Dallas City Council committee meeting this month said assisting the agency with immigration enforcement would be a benefit.

“It’s good for the city, because you definitely have some individuals that fall through the cracks,” an ICE official who identified himself only as an assistant Dallas field office director named Francis said at the meeting. For example, he said, a person released on traffic citations could have been previously deported, re-entered the country illegally and possibly committed offenses.

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe.
“She didn’t understand it at all.” Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer.
“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience.
“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston.","A Massachusetts college student has been deported to Honduras after attempting to fly down to Austin, Texas, to surprise her family for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19 year-old business major at Babson College in Wellesley who came to the U.S. in 2014 when she was eight years old, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport last Thursday as she was about to board her flight, having already successfully passed through security without incident.

Todd Pomerleau, her attorney, explained that Lopez Belloza had been told there was a problem with her ticket when she scanned her boarding pass and referred to a customer service desk, whereupon she was taken into federal custody.

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe. “She didn’t understand it at all.”

Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer. Then, in a bitter irony, she was flown to Texas on Saturday after all, only to subsequently find herself deported to Honduras, a country to which she has not returned since childhood.

Only after 48 hours was she able to call her frantic parents from her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula to let them know what had happened, heartbroken to miss the holidays with her young sisters and fearful for the future.

Speaking to CBS Austin, Pomerleau scathingly characterized the tactics used to detain his client as an “unconstitutional bag job” and Lopez Belloza as “a Dreamer living a draconian nightmare right now.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Independent: “On November 20, Customs and Border Protection arrested Any Lopez-Belloza, an illegal alien from Honduras, as she was attempting to board a flight at Boston Logan International Airport.

“This illegal alien entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge ordered her removed from the country in 2015, over 10 years ago. She has illegally stayed in the country since. Lopez-Belloza will remain in ICE custody pending removal.”

The Independent also reached out to ICE for comment.

“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience. “I’m losing everything.”

Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council, has been helping the student’s family since her plight became known and said Lopez Belloza had been the subject of an outstanding removal order since 2017, although she had not been aware of it.

“[Her family] didn’t know to show up somewhere, and she certainly had no idea of any of this,” Gupta said, explaining that immigration courts can issue such orders without the subject being present and that notifications are all too frequently mailed to incorrect addresses.

“People with final orders of removal, like this young college freshman from Babson College, are highly vulnerable under an administration that is pursuing such a cruel and indiscriminate deportation agenda,” she added, alluding to President Donald Trump’s second term crackdown on illegal immigration.

According to court documents ABC News, a federal judge had ordered the government not to remove Lopez Belloza from the U.S. and not to transfer her outside of Massachusetts, instructions that appear to have been ignored.

“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston. “She’s a child under the immigration law. She’s under the age of 21. She’s going to college. She has zero record.

“We believe her constitutional rights were violated, the way she was arrested, not having any notice why she’s arrested, not shown any documents to justify her abrupt, egregious removal from the United States of America.

“You’re supposed to be thankful this time of the year. Just be thankful ICE hasn’t destroyed your family.”

Ricky Soto, a family friend who works with the student’s father Francis at a Texas tailoring business, said that he had arranged the fateful ticket for Lopez Belloza to return to her parents and subsequently helped them to find legal backing.

“It really didn’t feel like it was real life because nothing made sense,” he told the Globe. “I can only imagine how terrifying that was for her… She was so excited, because she wasn’t expecting to come home.”

He added that the family had endured a tough time since settling in the U.S. but were “really proud” when their eldest daughter had been accepted into Babson on a scholarship.

Pomerleau said his client was “really sad” about what had happened to her, missed her family and was concerned that she may never be able to complete her finals, which are scheduled in a matter of weeks.

“I told her, ‘We’re going to fight like hell until we bring you back,’” he said.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/27/16/30/Any-Lucia-Lopez-Belloza.png?trim=39,0,313,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-28 07:57:04.005016

Last Wednesday, shortly after 2:00 p.m., 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on several National Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington. The attack occurred on the eve of Thanksgiving near the busy Farragut West Metro station, frequented by tourists and federal employees due to its proximity to the White House. Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded: 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom died last night after being shot twice, once in the chest and once in the head; her comrade, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, is still fighting for his life after undergoing surgery.

Lakanwal was immediately arrested by police after an exchange of gunfire in which he was wounded. He is an Afghan refugee who entered the United States on September 8, 2021, as part of a program to repatriate personnel who had worked with U.S. authorities during the war against the Taliban. According to State Department data, Operation Allies Welcome — approved during the administration of Democratic president Joe Biden — helped some 76,000 Afghans travel to the United States to avoid falling into the hands of the Taliban, who seized control of the country after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops. Many of them worked with the CIA or the U.S. military on high-risk security missions or assisted diplomats as translators and interpreters.

Most had to undergo rigorous vetting by U.S. security agencies to rule out concerns about their backgrounds and confirm they had no ties to the Taliban. This process has been one of the main points of criticism from President Donald Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly insisted that it allowed Taliban fighters to slip through. Although efforts were made to provide all necessary security guarantees, the investigation carried out by Republicans in Congress reveals some shortcomings due to the speed of the admissions process.

Refugees who passed the vetting process were granted a permit allowing them to reside in the United States for two years with temporary status. More than 40% of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to defend the United States or were relatives of those who did, the Department of Homeland Security explained to several U.S. media outlets on Thursday.

Upon arriving in the United States, Lakanwal settled in Bellingham, a small town north of Seattle, where he lived with his wife and five children. After his two-year temporary visa expired, he applied for permanent asylum in December 2024. His request was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office, according to State Department sources consulted by CNN.

Trump and his team moved swiftly on Wednesday after learning the identity of the attacker who targeted the members of the National Guard. They quickly criticized the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal into the country and used the case to push for tougher immigration policies. They ordered a suspension of the review of Afghan immigration procedures and a reassessment of the permits of those already living in the United States. According to AP, this raises the possibility that the settlement rights of Afghan allies who worked with U.S. forces could be restricted.

“[Lakanwal] was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said Wednesday night in an extraordinary, pre-recorded address following the shooting in the nation’s capital. “Nobody knew who was coming in, nobody knew anything about it. His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country,” he added before a shocked nation on the eve of Thanksgiving, one of the most cherished holidays for families.

“This attack highlights the fundamental national security threat facing our nation. Twenty million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from countries that you don’t want to even know about. No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” the Republican president added during his speech, exaggerating the figures.

After the shooting, the government stopped processing all immigration applications from Afghan citizens “pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said on X. “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump added in the video recorded Wednesday.

Some supporters of the repatriation process warned on Thursday of the risks now faced by those who escaped the Taliban. “I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac. “We aren’t going to be tricked. One man’s lunatic behavior mustn’t be used to vilify a whole community, especially one that stood by us for so long,” he wrote on social media.

The immigration policy promoted by Trump is one of the most controversial issues at the start of his second term in the White House. He has ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pursue and deport undocumented immigrants. These enforcement actions have sparked large protests in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston. So far this year, ICE has participated in more than 60,000 immigrant arrests. In addition, Trump has ordered a review of the cases of 200,000 refugees admitted during Biden’s term and is ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) granted to political refugees, affecting tens of thousands of people from Venezuela, South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries.

Trump also ordered a comprehensive review of green card holders from high-risk countries on Thursday, according to a post on X by Joseph Edlow, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” he wrote on the social network.

Trump went one step further in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions.”

The National Guard on the streets

The other controversial issue is the presence of National Guard troops on the streets of some U.S. cities, coincidentally all governed by Democrats.

In early August, Trump issued an order to deploy approximately 2,600 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., in response to what he described as a “crime emergency.” The National Guard is a military force under the command of the governors of each of the 50 states. Its members are reservists — they are volunteers who work or study and are only deployed in specific situations, such as natural disasters or large-scale civil unrest.

Soldiers typically patrol in small groups. They walk the streets and public spaces, especially near subway stations. The National Guard’s role is to deter crime, and while its members cannot make arrests, they have assisted in immigration raids ordered by the White House.

Trump boasts that there is less crime on the streets of Washington, D.C. after the deployment of troops, contrary to official statistics from the city’s police department.

The deployment of these troops has drawn criticism from Democrats and numerous federal officials in the capital. Washington’s Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over the deployment, according to the Associated Press. A federal judge ordered the troops to withdraw and the mission to be shut down. He has given the government until December 11 to comply with the order and to appeal the decision.

Some army officials have also expressed concern about the risk the deployment could pose to troops, according to the AP. It “presents an opportunity for criminals, violent extremists, issue motivated groups and lone actors to advance their interests, given the prominence of locality, and expected media coverage for the mission,” an internal memo states.

Despite criticism over the deployment of troops in cities, Trump ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington on Wednesday, following the shooting. The city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, expressed her opposition to the deployment. “These young people should be at home in West Virginia with their families,” she stated.

In a video recorded on Wednesday, the Republican president also referred to the Somali community in Minnesota — where nearly 90,000 Somalis live, the largest such community in the country — even though they had nothing to do with the incident: “An example is Minnesota, where hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state. Billions of dollars are lost and gangs of Somalians come from a country that doesn’t even have a government. No laws, no water, no military, no nothing, as their representatives in our country preach to us about our Constitution and how our country is no good.”

Trump’s words reflect the White House strategy of toughening immigration policies on any pretext, without sufficient justification.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/7ITWIIWR6JOHDBIEHP3P4IAYYE.jpg?auth=16578d7bda5a2713ba3ddd08ec678a54405871353e745b8d03b7f23b249b90dd&width=1200,N,,2025-11-28 05:56:23.598748

He joined 215 other Catholic bishops in approving a statement advocating for reform of federal immigration policies to ensure human dignity and respect, the Nov. 12 statement said.

Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""
He urged balance in immigration policy.","Delaware's largest Roman Catholic figure recently joined other bishops in the U.S. in condemning federal immigration policy.

The Most Rev. William Koenig, bishop of the Diocese of Wilmington, runs the diocese for all Catholic parishes of Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore. He joined 215 other Catholic bishops in approving a statement advocating for reform of federal immigration policies to ensure human dignity and respect, the Nov. 12 statement said.

The statement said there is a balance to be found between national security and human rights, and it calls for compassion toward immigrants.

""Despite obstacles and prejudices, generations of immigrants have made enormous contributions to the well-being of our nation,"" the statement reads. ""We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity. For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.""

Koenig was even featured in a video promoting the statement on the social media of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The statement came from the Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore, where the bishops deliberated over this topic and issued this rare statement.

What Delaware's bishop has to say

In an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, Koenig said a small group was asked to draft a statement, which was worked on by small groups within the conference. The process took a few days, he said.

Statements like this can be released only when all the bishops are together, which is usually during the twice-annual plenary meetings.

Koenig said he is on board with the statement and hopes to see immigration reform.

""They're vital parts of the community,"" he said. ""Let's help them become naturalized.""

He emphasized that exclusionary treatment of immigrants is not a new phenomenon. The official statement says that the bishops ""are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.""

While deportations were common under the Biden and Obama administrations, both Trump administrations have used mass deportations and enhanced border security as key selling points to voters for nearly a decade. The increase of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago has led to protests from locals.

A ProPublica investigation said that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, and inhumane treatment by ICE agents has been frequently reported over the course of the year.

Growing sentiment toward immigration reform

The statement on behalf of all bishops is pretty rare, but the sentiment is not unheard of recently. Over the summer, the Dioceses of Nashville and San Bernadino excused church members from attending weekly Mass over fear of ICE agents conducting arrests at local churches.

Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""

Koenig said everyone is made in God's image and likeness, and that he would like to see additional pathways to citizenship rather than immigrants treated with no respect. He takes a biblical perspective toward the issue.

""I certainly would want to respect someone who doesn't look like us, someone who isn't from our country,"" Koenig said. ""If the person needs more time to get legal status, try to work with that person.""

He urged balance in immigration policy. He understands the need for national security, he said, but wants the country to ""temper justice with mercy.""

""Do what we need to do, but we need to do it with compassion,"" he said.

The reactions to the pope's and bishops' statements from the Delaware Catholic congregation has been pretty quiet, according to Koenig. A study from the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Delawareans were religious, 19% of whom were Catholic. He said the Hispanic community, very often targeted by ICE nationally, have great faith and ""enrich"" the diocese with its enthusiasm.

He said the role the diocese's parishes will continue to play in Delaware is to offer spiritual and pastoral care, on top of the charitable work many parishes already undertake. He also encouraged everyone to read the entire statement.

""People in Wilmington are nice,"" he said.

Outlook The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally.
Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation.","Courts, regulators, enforcers, and plaintiffs’ counsel used to clearly distinguish between entity-level and individual responsibility. But emerging theories of corporate officer liability are eroding that long-standing separation.

Recent developments in Delaware and federal enforcement policy signal a heightened risk of personal civil and criminal exposure for executives under both state fiduciary duty doctrines and federal fraud and control-person statutes.

Given these changes, as well as the rise of novel exposure points, companies should establish or review safeguards designed to prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of oversight.

Delaware Litigation

In the landmark In re McDonald’s Corp. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery dramatically extended executive civil legal exposure. The court held that corporate officers (not just board members) owe Caremark-style oversight duties within their respective spheres of responsibility.

For executives, the implications are significant. Failing to act on credible warning signs regarding compliance, workplace conduct, or operational risks can trigger personal derivative liability, even absent direct participation in wrongdoing.

Post-McDonald’s cases have begun applying this reasoning to a range of C-suite positions. For example, in July, the court in Hizkiyev & Barak v. Kaseya, Inc. cited McDonald’s Corp. in concluding that officers and key managerial employees owe the same fiduciary duties as directors.

The broadening of executive legal exposure likely will extend to jurisdictions beyond Delaware, particularly as aggressive plaintiffs’ firms test the boundaries of officer oversight obligations.

Federal Enforcement’s Focus

At the federal level, the Department of Justice continues to make individual accountability a central pillar of its enforcement strategy. This has remained as true during the Biden administration as is in the Trump administration.

For example, federal enforcement officials have linked individual accountability to incentives for self-reporting and cooperation. Biden-era DOJ leadership emphasized that companies seeking cooperation credit must identify all individuals involved in misconduct, regardless of position. They also warned that executives who obstructed or ignored internal warnings could face personal exposure even if their company ultimately avoided prosecution.

These policies have continued under the Trump administration. The June 9 Foreign Corrupt Practice Act guidelines put individual accountability at the center of the DOJ’s enforcement policy.

Similarly, the Criminal Division’s corporate enforcement and voluntary self-disclosure policy and guidance on coordinating corporate resolution penalties in parallel criminal, civil, regulatory, and administrative proceedings—citing Justice Manual 1-12.000—remain focused on holding accountable individuals who are considered most responsible for “corporate malfeasance.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission likewise continues to invoke Section 20(a) control-person liability and the books-and-records provisions to pursue CFOs, controllers, and compliance officers who “caused” inaccurate disclosures or internal control failures. This approach reflects the broader trend toward holding senior leaders responsible not just for what they knew, but for what they purportedly should have known.

Collectively, these developments mark a paradigm shift from corporate to personal culpability.

New Risk Areas

The emerging risk landscape extends beyond traditional financial controls. Enforcers, regulators, and private plaintiffs in the US, Europe, and elsewhere are increasingly targeting environmental, social, and governance disclosures; forced-labor compliance; and artificial intelligence governance as new areas where executives face personal legal exposure.

For example, false or overstated ESG commitments, whether in sustainability reports or SEC filings, can underpin securities fraud or consumer-protection claims. Executives responsible for ESG reporting or data-management programs could be held liable for misrepresentations or for failing to implement adequate oversight mechanisms.

Similarly, supply-chain transparency laws such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act have created new obligations that can implicate officers when compliance systems are deficient.

AI-related risks follow the same trajectory. As companies deploy AI tools in decision-making, hiring, and risk assessment, regulators and enforcers are warning that executives can’t delegate accountability to algorithms.

In short, the scope of what constitutes “oversight” has broadened dramatically, requiring senior leaders to anticipate nontraditional risk domains previously viewed as peripheral to their fiduciary duties.

Practical Implications

To navigate this shifting environment, companies and their leadership teams should prioritize structural and procedural safeguards that both prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of good-faith oversight. Key steps to consider include:

Clarify role definition. Delineate the responsibilities of operational, risk, and compliance executives to reduce role ambiguity and overlapping accountability.

Formalize governance protocols. Establish and document escalation procedures for compliance issues, ensuring that red flags are tracked and resolved at the appropriate managerial level.

Review directors-and-officers insurance coverage. Confirm that Side A/B/C policies extend to officer-level oversight and regulatory claims, and that indemnification provisions remain robust.

Preserve privilege during investigations. Coordinate with outside counsel to structure internal investigations in ways that protect attorney-client privilege while demonstrating diligence to stakeholders and ensuring the integrity of investigative findings.

Document training and oversight. Regularly train senior management on fiduciary and compliance obligations, maintaining contemporaneous records that evidence proactive oversight.

Companies should also reassess their executive onboarding and certification processes, ensuring that officers acknowledge their oversight duties and understand the personal consequences of noncompliance. A well-crafted governance memo or certification statement can help memorialize these expectations and support defense arguments in derivative or regulatory proceedings.

Outlook

The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally. The once-clear gap between entity level, board member, and individual executive liability is narrowing.

Emerging domains such as ESG, supply-chain transparency, and AI oversight have created novel exposure points that require cross-functional awareness. Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation. Demonstrating a credible, well-documented culture of compliance can mean the difference between defending a more diffuse corporate decision and defending oneself in court.

In this article, we examine the recent judgment of Mr. Justice Mould in the case of Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd [2025] EWHC 2937 (KB) , delivered on 13–15 October 2025. The case involved the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers, and the refusal of the High Court to grant a final injunction under Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA 1990) to prevent this use. We consider the legal issues raised in the judgment, including the application of Section 187B, the criteria for granting injunctions, the role of proportionality and public interest, the consideration of broader societal impacts, and the intervention of the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD).

Statement of Facts

The case concerned the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers. Epping Forest District Council sought a final injunction under Section 187B of the TCPA 1990 to prevent the use of the hotel for this purpose, alleging a breach of planning control. The High Court refused to grant the injunction, finding that enforcement through Section 187B was neither just nor proportionate in the circumstances. The court emphasised the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation and the importance of fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to prevent destitution among asylum seekers. The SSHD sought to intervene in the proceedings but was initially denied intervener status by the High Court. This decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal.

Law

Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990: This provision allows LPAs to apply for an injunction to restrain an actual or apprehended breach of planning control where it is deemed ‘necessary or expedient’. The court has discretion to grant such an injunction if it deems it appropriate for restraining the breach. However, LPAs are expected to consider conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief, as failure to do so may influence the court’s decision.

Criteria for granting injunctions: In Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, the court outlined three key considerations for granting an injunction under Section 187B:

Whether there is an actual or apprehended breach of planning control;

Whether it is necessary or expedient to restrain such a breach by means of an injunction; and

Which defendants (if any) are the proper persons to be restrained.

Proportionality and public interest: The court must weigh the balance of convenience and assess whether the harm caused by the alleged breach of planning control is outweighed by the public interest. Injunctive relief under Section 187B should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate.

Broader societal impacts: The court must consider the broader societal impacts of planning enforcement actions, including statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which aim to prevent destitution among asylum seekers.

Intervention by the SSHD: Under CPR 19.2(2), the court may grant permission for a party to intervene in proceedings if it is desirable to do so to resolve the issues in dispute. The Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of state for the Home Department (“SSHD”) had a pivotal constitutional role and could materially contribute to the judicial decision-making process through evidence and legal argument.

Analysis

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides significant guidance on the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990. The court’s refusal to grant the injunction was based on the principle that injunctive relief should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate. While the court indicated that the council may have had a reasonable basis to allege a breach of planning control (whilst being critical of the exercise of delegated powers), the court found that the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation outweighed the planning harm alleged. This aligns with the principle that LPAs should exhaust conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief.

The court’s decision also reflects the criteria established in Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, particularly the need to assess whether an injunction is necessary or expedient to restrain the breach of planning control. In this case, the court determined that the balance of convenience did not favour granting the injunction, as the harm caused by the alleged breach was outweighed by the significant public interest in providing accommodation for asylum seekers.

The judgment further underscores the importance of considering broader societal impacts in planning enforcement actions. The Bell Hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was deemed critical to fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which include preventing destitution among asylum seekers. This public interest consideration was pivotal in the court’s decision to refuse the injunction.

Finally, the intervention of the SSHD in the proceedings highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant parties are given the opportunity to contribute to the judicial decision-making process. The Court of Appeal’s decision to overturn the High Court’s refusal to grant intervener status to the SSHD demonstrates the necessity of considering the constitutional role and potential contributions of intervening parties in cases with significant public interest implications.

Conclusion

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides a clear precedent for the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990, emphasising the importance of proportionality, public interest, and the exhaustion of conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief. The case also highlights the need to consider broader societal impacts and statutory duties in planning enforcement actions which had not been done in this case. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal’s decision regarding the SSHD’s intervention underscores the importance of allowing relevant parties to contribute to the resolution of disputes with significant public interest implications. This judgment serves as a reminder to LPAs to adopt a balanced approach to enforcement and to carefully consider the necessity and proportionality of seeking injunctive relief in planning control cases.",https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/images/LGL_Favicon_2025.png,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:17.167294

What does the law say?

Under U.S. immigration law, spouses of American citizens who entered the country lawfully are generally eligible to adjust status, even if their tourist/business visa has expired during the lengthy green-card process.

Despite the law's adjustments, ICE's explanation in many of these cases was “visa overstay.” No allegations of fraud or criminal behavior were cited, and many of those detained had already passed preliminary background and security checks.

According to KBPS, ICE said in a statement that it is dedicated to upholding immigration law while ignoring criticisms regarding the necessity of these green card arrests.

The immigration lawyers whose clients have been arrested are saying that the arrests represent “a drastic policy shift,” one that undermines decades of practice.

Advocates say these detentions undercut promises that serving in the military or being married to a citizen offers security or protection. ICE's current rampant arrests from the green-card interviews disregard humanitarian and moral obligations, especially for long-established families.

Lawsuits being filed

AP reported that a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on November 25, 2025. It challenges ICE’s detention of immigrants who showed up for routine check-ins or legal proceedings in San Diego.

The lawsuit argued that re-detaining people previously cleared for release, without new crimes or warnings, violates their constitutional due-process rights.

The lawsuit names petitioners who had complied with all prior hearings and court orders, had no criminal record, yet were taken into custody unexpectedly during ICE-scheduled check-ins.

Earlier in 2025, a similar lawsuit was filed against ICE for courthouse arrests in San Diego after agents detained asylum-seekers and other immigrants exiting immigration court, reportedly without giving them proper due process. That suit argues such arrests are “arbitrary” and undermine the integrity of the immigration legal process.

Their joint report, “’You Have Arrived in Hell’: Torture and Other Abuses Against Venezuelans in El Salvador’s Mega Prison,” describes how people who were apprehended or processed by US agencies were sent to El Salvador and placed in the maximum‑security Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), where survivors and witnesses have reported systematic mistreatment, prolonged isolation, and conditions that the researchers concluded amounted to torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

The report explains that many of the transferred individuals had not been convicted of violent crimes and that the criteria used to identify alleged gang affiliation were unreliable and arbitrary. The report explains that an “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” and other screening tools were applied in ways that assign guilt by association — counting tattoos, clothing, gestures, or social‑media connections as indicia of membership. Experts and family members have described these measures as deeply flawed. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal argue that these procedures produced wrongful classifications and exposed people to foreseeable risks when they were handed over to Salvadoran authorities.

Inside CECOT, the report recounted repeated accounts of physical violence, humiliating treatment, and severe deprivation. Survivors told researchers that guards beat detainees on arrival and throughout their confinement; one detainee said, “They beat us almost every day.” Others described forced head shavings, prolonged solitary confinement in a segregated area known to detainees as “the Island,” and incidents of sexual violence and threats. The report quotes detainees who said that, upon being brought into the facility, officials told them, “You have arrived in hell.”

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal identified patterns of enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention. Families report that they were denied information about relatives’ whereabouts for extended periods; some relatives say they received no official confirmation of detention until months later. The organizations describe cases in which detainees were held without meaningful access to counsel, without consistent medical care, and with severely restricted contact with the outside world. The report emphasizes that secrecy and lack of transparency compounded the risk of abuse and make independent monitoring difficult.

The report examines the bilateral and programmatic context for the transfers. It describes US funding and cooperation with Salvadoran security agencies, noting a grant letter and other assistance that the authors say facilitates the operations. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal have also raised legal concerns about the transfers, arguing that sending people to El Salvador in circumstances where they faced a real risk of torture or ill‑treatment violated the principle of non‑refoulment under international law. The organizations have called for the suspension of any arrangements enabling transfers until independent safeguards and monitoring are in place.

Researchers have also scrutinized the legal authorities and administrative mechanisms used to justify the removals. The report points out that a mix of immigration procedures and emergency proclamations have been invoked, and it questions whether adequate legal review and oversight has occurred. The authors argue that the use of expedited or exceptional authorities without transparent safeguards has increased the risk that people could be wrongly designated as security threats and transferred without meaningful procedural protections.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal documents the human consequences of those policies through detailed interviews with survivors, family members, lawyers, and medical professionals. The report describes physical injuries consistent with beatings, psychological trauma from prolonged isolation and threats, and the long‑term health impacts of inadequate medical care. It recounts the anguish of families who have been unable to locate loved ones and the frustration of lawyers who have faced obstacles in obtaining records or access to clients.

The organizations conclude that the pattern of transfers and the conditions of detention require urgent remedial action. They recommend that the United States immediately halt transfers of third‑country nationals to El Salvador due to the risk of torture or ill‑treatment; disclose any agreements or understandings governing transfers; condition assistance on verifiable human‑rights safeguards; and rescind emergency proclamations or other measures that circumvented normal legal protections. They urge El Salvador to investigate allegations of abuse, ensure independent oversight of detention facilities, provide adequate medical care and legal access to detainees, and hold perpetrators of abuse to account.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/The_White_House_-_54452405984-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 05:56:38.879334

On September 30, 2025, Frank Heindel, a freedom-of-information advocate, sued the University of South Carolina (“USC”) in the Fifth Judicial Circuit Court in Richland County, SC to obtain records pertaining to the school’s payments of more than $20,000,000 to student athletes. The lawsuit claims that the school violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and asks the judge to “either order USC to turn over the records in their entirety or hold a confidential hearing to determine which parts might be exempt from disclosure.”

Following landmark shifts in Name Image and Likeness and collegiate revenue sharing (a result of the House v. NCAA settlement), USC, along with most universities in the United States, have begun to explore the uncharted waters surrounding the disbursement of funds to student-athletes. Schools that opted into the settlement are permitted to utilize $20.5 million to pay their athletes and are subject to FOIA requests for information and records. However, USC has failed to produce responsive documents to FOIA requests for invoices from USC’s NIL Collective, The Garnet Trust. USC has claimed that the information being requested is not in their possession but rather in the possession of private actors and companies like the NIL Collective and Learfield – entities not beholden to the same FOIA laws as the school. On September 4, 2025, USC was sent a FOIA request from Frank Heindel, who is an open records advocate and has sued USC in the past for failing to respond to a previous FOIA request in 2019. Through his request, Heindel is seeking to obtain any “executed revenue-sharing contracts or agreements between the university and its football players.” The university subsequently denied the request, claiming that the information is shielded by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Heindel claims USC’s position is “legally untenable” and that when a public university spends tax dollars, their usage of funds should be disclosed. The plaintiff is seeking a court order directing USC to either produce the records or hold a hearing to determine which records are exempt from disclosure.

“I’m not asking for names or grade point averages. I’m asking how a public university spends public money,” said Heindel. The university’s legal representative, attorney Andrew Lindemann of Lindemann Law Firm, P.A. in Columbia, South Carolina, responded, saying the university “had lawfully and accurately responded to Heindel’s records request.” A hearing was set for October 10, 2025. Following the hearing, Judge Daniel Coble, who is presiding over the case, ordered a review of the records, asserting that he wanted to “flesh out some of the things mentioned in the affidavit.”",https://sportslitigationalert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cropped-sla-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:44.332538

In July, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act, which amended eligibility provisions for SNAP in various ways.

In late October, during the height of the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) subagency Food Nutrition Services (FNS) issued guidance interpreting the recently-passed omnibus legislation. That guidance purports to limit noncitizen access to SNAP benefits in several significant ways.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James says the FNS guidance ""errs"" in how it interprets the new law.

At the heart of the litigation are the government's apparent efforts to keep certain categories of noncitizens who become green card holders from ever accessing SNAP benefits, the plaintiffs say.

The 28-page complaint offers a condensed history lesson:

Prior to the OBBB going into effect, non-citizens who entered the United States as refugees or were granted asylum were eligible for SNAP, based on their status at the time of their admission or parole. This was also true for many who were granted humanitarian parole. OBBB eliminated these categories of eligibility in the FNA. However, nothing in OBBB prohibits individuals who once held the status of refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees from gaining eligibility for SNAP if and when they adjust their status to lawful permanent residents (LPRs).

To hear the plaintiffs tell it, immigrants who came to the United States as refugees or asylum seekers ""can be eligible for SNAP benefits if they adjust status and become"" green card holders, but the Trump administration is trying to make sure such immigrants ""will never be eligible for SNAP benefits.""

""The Guidance creates a false dichotomy in describing categories of immigration statuses post-OBBB as either 'Not eligible unless an LPR' or 'Not eligible,'"" the lawsuit reads. ""Regardless of the status they once held, any non-citizen who adjusts to LPR status can become eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements. However, the Guidance incorrectly places many of these individuals in the 'Not eligible' category, rather than the 'Not eligible unless an LPR category'""

The plaintiffs say the government is ""misleadingly"" telling certain groups of immigrants they can never become eligible for SNAP benefits.

""In reality, irrespective of someone's immigration status before becoming an LPR, once they obtain their Green Card, they are eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements,"" the lawsuit goes on.

A secondary issue is the speed with which SNAP benefits can be conferred on certain non-citizens due to an ancillary law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA).

Under PRWORA, green card holders are only eligible for SNAP benefits if they have lived in the country for at least five years or without the five-year waiting period if they fall into ""approximately a dozen"" enumerated categories — such as being blind, disabled, or a child, the lawsuit explains.

Now, however, the government says those exceptions to the waiting period no longer apply to certain classes of green card holders.

The plaintiffs reject this ""clear"" misreading of PRWORA, the lawsuit says.

""PRWORA excludes individuals who were admitted as refugees, granted asylum, had their deportation withheld, and others, from the five-year waiting period,"" the complaint continues. ""And no provision of the OBBB amended PRWORA's exemptions from its five-year waiting period.""

A tertiary issue identified by the plaintiffs is a new system to identify and account for errors envisioned by the FNS guidance.

That new system, the plaintiffs insist, ""would saddle states with catastrophic financial penalties unless they immediately implement the unlawful restrictions,"" according to a press release issued by James' office.

Under the OBBB, states have 120 days to process new guidance and root out violations, according to the lawsuit. Still, the Trump administration is trying to implement the FNS guidance with only one day of leeway for any such violations, the filing explains.

""The federal government's shameful quest to take food away from children and families continues,"" James said in a statement. ""USDA has no authority to arbitrarily cut entire groups of people out of the SNAP program, and no one should go hungry because of the circumstances of their arrival to this country. My office will always fight to protect Americans' SNAP benefits, and I will do everything in my power to shield New Yorkers from this unlawful policy.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Letitia-James-Donald-Trump.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:49.113535

An attorney claimed that his client was detained and handcuffed when he appeared for the Green Card interview.

Immigration attorney Saman Nasseri said the federal agencies have begun arresting visa overstays during their interviews. Some couples and their lawyers told The New York Times they had followed the required steps to secure permanent residency.

""ICE and USCIS have started implementing a policy where ICE is now making arrests at USCIS offices during the green card interviews on anyone who is a visa overstay, so if they're out of status, ICE is making that arrest at the interviews,"" Saman Nasseri was quoted as saying by CBS8.

Nasseri stated that five of his clients were taken into custody during Green Card interviews just last week. He said that his clients have no criminal history or arrests.

""None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history that are in this situation. These are just cases where they entered legally, they overstayed their visa. All of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri added.

Another attorney, Habib Hasbini, also confirmed similar experiences with his clients.

""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini told CBS8.

Attorney Habib Hasbini observed that, so far, these detentions seem to be confined to the USCIS office in San Diego.

Hasbini recommended that those with scheduled GreenCard interviews should still attend, while remaining cautious and prepared for potential detentions.

He suggests making family and work arrangements in case of detention, noting that not attending an interview can result in case denial for abandonment. Additionally, because individuals are out of status, they may still face arrest by ICE regardless, CBS8 reported.

MEXICAN NATIONAL DETAINED, HANDCUFFED DURING GREEN CARD INTERVIEW: US ATTORNEY

Immigration attorney Tessa Cabrera told ABC 10 that her client, a Mexican national residing in the US since 2002, was handcuffed and taken into custody during his GreenCard interview.

The man's US citizen daughter had applied for him to get permanent residency, according to the ABC10 report.

""The officer said, I'll be right back and stepped out. And then, two ICE officers walked in. They asked him what his name was and then put him in handcuffs,"" Cabrera said.

The client was taken to the basement of the federal building and was detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, according to Cabrera.

She said that ICE officers gave her a ""Warrant for Arrest"" issued by the Department of Homeland Security.

The warrant states they have probable cause based on statements made to the immigration officer or evidence that the person lacks immigration status or is removable under immigration law, according to the report.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said.
“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room.
A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.
“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered.","The shooting of two National Guard members the day before in Washington hung over President Trump’s Thanksgiving events at Mar-a-Lago, where he held a call with members of the military to thank them for their service on the holiday.

At the beginning of the call, he revealed that one of the Guard members, Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, had died.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said. “She was savagely attacked. She’s dead. Not with us.” The other victim, he said, was “fighting for his life.”

Later, a White House official said that the president had spoken with the family of the slain National Guard member.

After authorities identified the suspect as an Afghan refugee, members of the Trump administration and other Republicans reacted furiously. They cited it as evidence of what they had been warning about immigration, condemned the Biden administration’s refugee policies and said it justified a further crackdown on immigration.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Thursday that in the wake of the attack, he was implementing new policy guidance on vetting prospective immigrants from 19 high-risk countries using “country-specific factors as significant negative factors.” The change in guidance had been under consideration before the shooting.

In his statement, Mr. Edlow blamed the Biden administration for “dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens.”

The fierce rhetoric was echoed across the administration.

“I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on social media on Wednesday. “Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn’t have been in our country.”

At Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Mr. Trump produced a photograph showing Afghans rushing onto a plane leaving their country as its government collapsed in 2021.

“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room. “That whole thing should have never, ever happened.”

When a reporter pointed out that, according to officials, the suspect had worked with the C.I.A. and therefore had been vetted, Mr. Trump said, “He went cuckoo, I mean, he went nuts.”

Mr. Trump said his administration was “looking at” the possibility of deporting the family of the 29-year-old suspect, who lived in Bellingham, Wash., with a wife and several children.

Asked whether he was blaming all Afghans for the crime of one man, Mr. Trump said, “No, but there’s a lot of problems with Afghans.”

Echoing largely unfounded claims that he has made about immigrants from other countries, he said that “many of these people are criminals, many of these people are people that shouldn’t be here.”

Jumping to the subject of Somali refugees in Minnesota, he said that population was “taking over” that state, bringing gang violence.

Asked what Somalis had to do with the Afghan suspect, Mr. Trump replied: “Ah, nothing, but Somalians have caused a lot of trouble, they’re ripping us off a lot of money.” This led him to criticize Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia.

“We’re not taking their people anymore,” he said.

In a pair of lengthy social media posts just before midnight on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and denaturalize migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity.” He did not provide details about how he would go about it, or provide specific evidence about problems created by immigrants.

He again referred to gangs from Somalia in Minnesota, questioning Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s intelligence and his ability to handle the supposed threat, and mocked Ms. Omar for her use of a hijab.

Similar language has exploded on the right since Wednesday’s shooting, including from Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, who called for Muslim potential immigrants to be banned and for the deportation of anyone deemed an “Islamist.”

In the case of the shooting suspect, he received asylum from the U.S. government in April, according to three people with knowledge of the case who were not authorized to speak publicly. A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.

“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered. “No matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out, but we’re going to be getting them all out now.”

But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt.
Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project.
She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign.
Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue.","Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Mayor of New York City has had a volatile relationship with President Trump. He's called the president a fascist. Trump, in return, has called him a ""little communist mayor,"" and warned that he may send in the National Guard. The administration also said it will expand ICE operations in the city.

But when the two leaders finally met face to face recently it was, to many people's surprise, cordial. Some may even say warm.

""We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job,"" the president said. Soon the internet was flooded with memes of the president looking admiringly up at Mamdani. The next day's New York Post cover read ""I love you Mam.""

But many New Yorkers say they're taking it all with a grain of salt and remaining on guard.

""The president says one thing one day, and a different thing the next,"" says one street vendor outside the subway station in Queens. ""You don't know what's real anymore.""

What she does know is that she's seen an uptick in immigration enforcement recently, which is why she asked that NPR withhold her name. She's undocumented, and she's worried.

Every morning at around 4:30 a.m., she posts up here and sells refreshments and breakfast. A few weeks ago, a little after setting up, she says several ICE agents jumped out of an unmarked car in pursuit of two workers who'd just bought something to eat.

She ran into the building behind her, locked the door and hid in the stairway until it was all over.

This vendor says she loves Mamdani, but worries the president will punish the city for electing a democratic socialist. She fears New York will turn into Chicago or Los Angeles, two cities that have experienced large-scale immigration raids.

This is a common sentiment in New York these days. The day after the White House meeting, President Trump said that while he's not planning on sending troops into New York now, he would, if needed. NPR reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no response.

Mamdani, for his part, reiterated he will defend immigrants in New York.

His team did not grant NPR an interview, despite multiple requests. But a source close to his transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity told NPR that Mamdani is exploring legal strategies at the local level to limit Trump's actions in New York City, including muscling up the NYC Law Department by adding 200 attorneys.

Congressman Patrick Ryan of the Hudson Valley, a Democrat whose district includes some of New York City's northern suburbs, told NPR that one of the lessons from Chicago and LA is that states can successfully challenge the administration in court. Ryan cites his own background as an Iraq War veteran.

""To come home to my state and my country, and see the idea of U.S. troops deployed against U.S. citizens and American cities, it's so fundamentally un-American. It's also, by the way, not what young American men and women sign up to do,"" he says.

He hopes the meeting between Mamdani and Trump de-escalated tensions. But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt. He's hoping for the best, he says, but preparing for the worst.

Which is what organizers on the streets are doing.

Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project. She says street vendors are among the most vulnerable immigrants in New York. ""Street Vendors are the eyes on the ground right? They see everything that happens.""

She's hopeful that the incoming Mayor will be an ally. She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign. Many of them, she says, see this as ""the next pandemic.""

The organization is, in fact, leaning in on pandemic-era strategies for vendors who are scared to work on the streets during immigration raids. ""We have a catering program for example, where people can reach out to us, and we'll connect them to a vendor for catering their event.""

She says, something the new mayor could do is make it easier for street vendors to operate — which Mamdani has said he will prioritize. He has pledged to allow thousands of additional license applications for vendors, and repeal criminal liability rules.

Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue. She wonders how long this liveliness will last, and how long she will endure.

""Three more years,"" she says, referring to the Trump administration. ""I hope they go by quickly.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8382x4715+0+873/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Fdc%2Fc47f8c8e4af6b267b7caf28fa3bd%2Fgettyimages-2242335314.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 21:56:39.171952

The Minister for Home Affairs can ban any items in immigration detention, if he thinks they pose a risk to the health or safety of people in detention, or to the good order of the detention centre.
This does not mean that all banned items will be automatically taken from you.
Under the new powers, immigration officers can search for weapons, documents (which might serve as evidence), and banned items, and take them from you.","Immigration officers and guards in detention now have new powers to search people and take away things like mobile phones.

It is important for you to know about these new powers, and to know your rights.

For now, the most important things you can do are:

Keep notes of what happened, if you are searched or your things are taken. This can even be voice notes on a phone, or the phone of a friend, that you can use later.

Write down on paper the phone numbers at the end of this guide. You can call these numbers for advice, if you are searched or your things are taken in detention.

Write down on paper other important info you keep in your phone, like passwords or the phone numbers of family and friends, in case your mobile phone is taken away.

What are the new powers?

Using their new powers, immigration officers and guards can:

Ban certain items;

Conduct searches for those items including:

Searches of your clothes, your possessions or your room;

Strip searches; and

Searches using dogs.

What items have been banned?

The Minister for Home Affairs can ban any items in immigration detention, if he thinks they pose a risk to the health or safety of people in detention, or to the good order of the detention centre.

So far, the following items have been banned:

Mobile phones

SIM cards

Devices that have the internet, including tablets and computers

Alcohol

It is possible that other items could end up being banned.

What happens to items that are banned?

Once an item is banned, immigration officers can:

Search you and your room for the item (without a warrant);

Seize the item (meaning take it from you).

This does not mean that all banned items will be automatically taken from you. You do not have to hand over your phone if officers have not asked for it.

But if you are searched and items are taken from you, then as soon as you can afterwards, you should tell a friend in detention about exactly what happened – or write down a note about what happened. This will be important when you speak to a lawyer later.

What happens if I am searched?

Under the new powers, immigration officers can search for weapons, documents (which might serve as evidence), and banned items, and take them from you.

The search powers are very broad. Immigration officers don’t need a warrant, and can search your clothing or room even if they don’t suspect that you have a weapon or a banned item.

Immigration officers can only conduct a strip search if they reasonably suspect that you have a weapon or a banned thing on you. They can’t ask you to take off more clothing, or search you for longer, than is necessary to find the thing they are looking for.

If you are strip-searched, please call one of the numbers below as soon as you can for advice.

What should I do if I have a banned item taken from me?

If you have a banned item taken from you, you should:

Ask for the reason the item has been taken from you;

Ask for the item to be returned to you;

If your medication has been taken, then tell them which doctor prescribed it and what you need it for;

If the officer doesn’t give it back, then ask why – they must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say; and

Call one of the numbers below to get advice.

What if my mobile phone or computer are taken from me?

People in detention have a right to communicate with their lawyers to get advice. Immigration officers can’t interfere with that right, by making it hard or impossible for you to communicate with your lawyer.

People in detention also have a right to communicate about political issues (like government policy or protests against detention). Communicating might mean talking on the phone or posting online about your political views. Officers can’t interfere with that communication without a good reason.

If officers take away your mobile phone or computer, they have to provide you with another way to contact your family and your lawyer.

If you have your computer or mobile phone taken from you, you should:

Immediately ask for your computer or phone to be returned to you.

If the officer doesn’t return the thing, then ask for reasons why – computers and mobile phones can only be taken from you if they pose a risk to people or the order of the detention facility, and officers must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say.

Ask what alternative means you will be given to communicate with your family or lawyer.Make a note of what they say.

Ask that a phone be made available to you immediately within business hours, to call one of the numbers below for advice.",https://www.hrlc.org.au/app/uploads/2025/04/General-Migration-MandatoryDetentionRally-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 23:56:33.722121

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ORDERED DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH TO MOBILIZE 500 MORE NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO D-C IN THE WAKE OF THE SHOOTING.","The Trump administration says it won’t process immigration requests from Afghan nationals for the foreseeable future. The order comes after a gunman opened fire on two National Guard members in the busy streets of Washington, D.C., just blocks away from the White House, on Wednesday afternoon.

Authorities identified the shooter as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

“This heinous assault was an act of evil, an act of hatred, and an act of terror,” President Donald Trump told the nation in an address Wednesday night. “It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.”

The West Virginia guard members — who were in Washington as part of the Trump administration’s takeover of the police department there — were taken to the hospital in critical condition. Investigators say it appears to have been a “targeted shooting.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post that Lakanwal was in the U.S. after being granted parole in 2021 under the Biden administration’s “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative. The initiative helped to safely relocate “vulnerable Afghans” and those who worked alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal from the country and subsequent Taliban takeover.

The federal government granted Lakanwal asylum earlier this year.

President Trump is now calling for a review of the immigration statuses of all Afghan migrants who were admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration.

“We’re not going to put up with these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn’t even be in our country,” he said. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

That's according to an Enquirer analysis of federal data for the three Northern Kentucky counties across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.

ICE detentions are on track to more than triple this year in Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties as President Trump's administration cracks down on immigration violations.

All three county jails have contracts to detain people on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The more immigrants detained, records show, the more money counties get from the federal government.

Boone County, for instance, made $4.5 million from its ICE contract last fiscal year.

In roughly the first seven months of 2025, the jails have made at least $5.2 million from daily ICE detention payouts.

But who are these detainees, where do they come from, and are they the “the worst of the worst” violent criminals Trump said would be targeted in immigration sweeps?

Here's what we know based on data from the University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project. The project collected information about ICE detainees in jails throughout the country.

The data includes detentions from Jan. 1 to July 28 this year.

How many detainees were charged with crimes in NKY?

About 752 people – roughly 54% – of ICE detainees in Northern Kentucky were charged with crimes when they were taken into custody.

Most of those crimes – about 17.5% – were traffic offenses, the data shows.

Fewer than 2% had committed violent crimes – aggravated assault, rape, or robbery – as categorized by the FBI.

The other 635 ICE detainees have not been charged with crimes, according to the most recent available data.

Most immigration violations are civil offenses, though entering the country illegally is a crime. About 2.5% of people faced charges for that.

In a previous email to The Enquirer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the media of peddling a ""FALSE narrative that ICE is not targeting criminal illegal aliens.""

""The official data tells the true story: 70% of ICE arrests were criminal illegal aliens with convictions or pending charges,"" she wrote in an email referencing national data.

Where do detainees come from?

Through July of this year, detainees in Northern Kentucky have reported citizenship in 59 countries.

Most were from Mexico and Guatemala. About 95% were male.

All of the 132 people deported from January to July were returned to the country where they had citizenship. The 103 who voluntarily left the country also returned to their country of citizenship, the data shows.

Some immigrants choose to voluntarily leave the United States as opposed to getting deported because it gives them a chance to legally enter the country later.

How long are they incarcerated?

The length of time people are held in the local jails varies wildly – from one day to more than 200.

But on average, people are in jail due to ICE detentions for roughly 43 days, based on available information.

ICE detentions on track to double

In the entirety of 2024, 1,185 were detained by ICE in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties.

That number is on track to double in 2025 with 1,387 ICE detentions in the first roughly seven months of the year.

According to available data, about 51% of people detained in 2025 had been deported or left the country by the end of July.

Why the spike in detentions locally?

A combination of increased federal resources for ICE detentions and the agency's new contracts with local jails are behind the uptick.

Boone County Jailer Jason Maydak said the county has housed ICE detainees for roughly 20 years.

""We literally just hold them for ICE. They bring them to us. We don't go get them. We don't pick them off the streets,"" he told The Enquirer.

The Boone, Campbell and Kenton county jails both have intergovernmental agreements that permit them to house the detainees on behalf of ICE.

Campbell and Kenton counties, however, didn't sign their contracts until May 2024 and March 2025 respectively. But that's mostly a processing change.

In previous years, for instance, ICE already had access to see who was booked in the jails for local charges and could see whether inmates also had immigration violations. Then, when the person was released on their local charges, ICE would be notified and in turn request a 48-hour detainment of the person.

Within that time frame, an ICE agent or other correction officer would then transport the person to Boone or Grayson counties.

The new contracts permit the county to house the inmates rather than having to transport them.

The change, Kenton County Jailer Marc Fields said, was prompted due to ICE. He said the organization reached out to the jail about changing their contract.

The jail agreed, primarily, because of money – the federal government pays local jails $88 per day to house the inmates and reimburses local jails for medical expenses, one of the jail's highest expenses.

Meanwhile, in addition to housing county inmates, the jail had also been holding hundreds of inmates for the state and was only reimbursed $35 per day.

""We kind of looked at it as our beds being a commodity for the county and … what is the best use of those not only for our residents but for our taxpayers?"" Fields said.

Kenton County expands cooperation with ICE

Kenton County Detention Center is the only local jail that's beefed up its cooperation with ICE, including a Jail Enforcement Memorandum and a Warrant Service Officer Program agreement, which were both signed March 28.

The officer program allows corrections officers to issue ICE administrative arrest warrants within the jail. The memorandum allows for the creation of at least one ICE-trained designated immigration officer at the Kenton County Dention Center who would act as a go-between between ICE officers and detainees.

The county plans to have two of the specially trained officers, though the two programs haven't kicked into gear yet because ICE hasn't hosted training sessions in the area yet.

Fields also echoed Maydak's sentiments about why the jail is seeing so many ICE detainees.

""It's totally enforcement on their side,"" he said.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly started detaining individuals during green card interviews at USCIS offices. “ICE and USCIS have started implementing a policy where ICE is now making arrests at USCIS offices during the green card interviews on anyone who is a visa overstay. If they’re out of status, ICE makes that arrest at the interviews,"" immigration attorney Saman Nasseri said, as quoted by CBS 8.

Nasseri reported that five of his clients were detained last week. None of them had criminal records or prior arrests. All were spouses of US citizens going through the standard green card process. “None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history. These are just cases where they entered legally and overstayed their visa, all of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri said. Immigration attorney Habib Hasbini confirmed similar cases. He said the detentions appear limited to the San Diego USCIS office. ""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini said. ""I have relationships with many attorneys working in many other counties; this is not happening for their clients in their vicinity, or it's only happening in San Diego,"" Hasbini added. Hasbini advised those with upcoming green card interviews to attend, but to plan for the possibility of detention, as missing an interview can result in case denial for abandonment.

Navy wife detained by ICE during green card interview

Arrests in front of families Reports from The Mirror describe ICE agents entering green card interview rooms in San Diego and arresting at least two immigrants in front of their American spouses and a six-month-old infant. The incidents occurred days after the November 12 start of similar arrests. In one case, Audrey Hestmark, the American wife of German national Tom Bilger, described three masked ICE agents handcuffing her husband and showing a QR code instead of identification, reported CTN. In another, Stephen Paul witnessed ICE arrest his British wife, Katie. The couple had decided to remain in the United States for her high-risk pregnancy.What ICE says An ICE spokesperson told CBS 8 that the agency is “committed to enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that prioritise national security, public safety, and border security.” The statement noted that individuals unlawfully present in the US, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal under US immigration law. ICE also said self-deportation remains the safest and most efficient option for those living illegally in the country. Tools like the CBP Home app are available to assist individuals with the process.Impact on migrant communities Immigration attorneys say arrests during green card interviews are unprecedented and may deter individuals from attending appointments, even when they are legally eligible for adjustment of status, reported The Mirror. Families face immediate impacts, including separation from spouses or children and uncertainty about the outcome of their immigration cases. As Stephen Paul said, “We had done everything they asked us to do. We were told it was the right procedure. And despite all that, they arrested her.”

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter joined Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson this month in a federal lawsuit over millions of dollars in police hiring grants that could be withheld by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, otherwise known as the COPS program. To access COPS money, the DOJ has insisted that cities certify they do not operate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and they will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

That isn’t St. Paul’s only legal battle with the White House.

In another recent skirmish, Minnesota’s capital city had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Evie — a network of electric vehicle charging stations aimed at boosting car-sharing — into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. In October, word came that the funding had been eliminated, alongside more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“The Trump administration’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in climate grants targeted communities based solely on politics,” said Jennifer Lor, a spokesperson for Carter’s office. “In St. Paul, this decision cut the remaining funds from our $560,844 subgrant, slowing our groundbreaking work to expand clean, affordable, and reliable electric car-share options across the city’s East Side.”

Growing legal actions by city

The loss of energy-related grants forms the basis of yet another new federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, the latest in a growing number of legal actions filed by St. Paul and other municipalities and nonprofits alleging constitutional violations and federal overreach.

It’s been a busy year for St. Paul City Attorney Lyndsey Olson and her legal team, who have represented the city in at least five major legal battles with the Trump administration while trying to protect upwards of $200 million in federal funding that could be withheld from the city’s housing, public safety, clean energy and transportation initiatives.

The White House has derided so-called “woke” policies, including St. Paul’s 2004 separation ordinance, which prohibits city employees from asking residents their immigration status before delivering city services. In response, “blue” cities have accused the Trump administration of blatant political retaliation for not stepping into line with the president’s executive orders, including bans on language around diversity, equity and inclusion outreach, or “DEI.”

“We’re certainly being targeted and punished,” said Olson on Tuesday. “Our residents are being punished. Taxpayers are being punished in ways that are political and don’t have anything to do with the grants. The courts say this is not legal … and they keep doing it.”

St. Paul has company. Chicago has filed upwards of 40 legal actions against federal agencies, accusing them of playing politics with vital grant funding. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its own legal action against St. Paul and other “blue” cities that don’t fall into step with its immigration policies, though the lawsuit was not served on the city until late November, Olson said.

With a new mayoral administration coming in following the election this month of Mayor-elect Kaohly Her over Mayor Melvin Carter, Olson said she expects to be leaving City Hall around January, as most St. Paul mayors handpick their chief attorney. She said she anticipates whomever holds her position in the months ahead to face similar battles with the White House, and Her has made no secret of her disdain for the president’s approach toward immigration enforcement.

“It’s not just the filing of the lawsuits and the litigation piece,” Olson said. “It’s tracking everything they’re doing all the time. … They’ll put new terms into grant agreements that are already in process. They’ll say ‘we’re going to withhold money until you agree to these terms.’ I think that’s our new normal for the remainder of this (presidential) administration. I think blue cities are being targeted.”

Here’s a look at six lawsuits involving St. Paul and the Trump administration:

San Francisco v. Trump

In February, St. Paul signed onto a lawsuit, led by the city of San Francisco, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to commandeer city services by denying federal funding to municipalities that don’t fall in line with its executive orders and immigration policies. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, alleges that the White House is violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states.

In a written posting to its website, the White House that week called out the St. Paul mayor by name, as well as other city leaders in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for immigrant-friendly policies that the president claimed protected “killers, rapists and drug dealers.” St. Paul has maintained a “separation ordinance” that bars city employees from asking residents about their immigration status while delivering core city services.

Olson said her team has “argued forcefully that St. Paul’s ordinance, in place since 2004, does not inhibit lawful federal immigration enforcement but appropriately delineates municipal roles under the 10th Amendment.”

The federal district court issued preliminary relief, and the case is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Fresno v. Turner

In August, St. Paul joined a coalition of cities and counties in a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration for allegedly punishing them by withholding or threatening to withhold $262 million in federal funding grants, including Community Development Block Grants, transportation funding and housing support.

The federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, had called on the cities to remove all references to “equity,” transgender rights and “environmental justice” in their grant work. Led by Fresno, Calif., the 10 jurisdictions filed their legal action in the Northern District Court of California, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

St. Paul joined the lawsuit after HUD and other federal agencies threatened to freeze or rescind more than $197.3 million already under contract, and jeopardized an additional $64.9 million in awarded funding “all to force compliance with a political agenda unrelated to the grant programs Congress authorized,” Olson said. “Had the administration succeeded, St. Paul would have faced catastrophic delays in housing development, emergency response projects, youth employment programs, and major infrastructure work such as the Kellogg Bridge replacement. A preliminary injunction protected these critical investments.”

Chicago v. Noem

In October, St. Paul joined Minneapolis, Ramsey County, Chicago, Denver, Boston and other jurisdictions in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly placing “unlawful and unrelated conditions” on more than $100 million in public safety and disaster grants. Olson said the “high-stakes suit” attempts to block “sweeping federal control of local policy.”

Chicago v. Noem, which was filed in federal district court in Illinois, alleges the White House is attempting to force cities and counties to police speech around diversity, equity or inclusion in violation of First Amendment and 10th Amendment rights, which include constitutional arguments around the separation of state and federal powers.

St. Paul alone is at risk of losing $4 million in pending or awarded funds, including funding covering about half the staffing in the city’s nine-person Emergency Management department. Olson said her legal team “emphasized that these conditions were wholly unrelated to the purpose of emergency-preparedness grants” and the lawsuit is intended to protect counterterrorism preparedness, port security, hazard-mitigation projects “and the city’s ability to respond to emergencies without political interference.”

United States v. State of Minnesota

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed legal action against the state of Minnesota, the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Hennepin County and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office over so-called “sanctuary city” policies that it alleges interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

The federal lawsuit followed similar legal action against Boston, New York City, Colorado and other jurisdictions that have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, including holding jail inmates past their scheduled release date so immigration authorities can determine if they’re wanted on federal immigration warrants. The lawsuit was served on St. Paul about a week ago, Olson said.

St. Paul v. Department of Energy, and Office of Management and Budget

St. Paul signed onto a federal lawsuit this month accusing the Trump administration of abruptly reneging on $7.56 billion in grant funding for 321 clean energy projects — including the city’s Evie car-charging stations — based on the political leanings of the 16 states they’re based in.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Environmental Defense Fund and four other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups, alleges constitutional violations of the First and Fifth amendments, which protect the freedom of speech and due process rights.

Chicago v. DOJ

St. Paul and Chicago filed legal action this month to prevent the Department of Justice from imposing sweeping new conditions on grants supporting the federally-backed COPS hiring program, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, compelled compliance with all executive orders and forced cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed this month in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois.

“The case challenged unconstitutional conditions that directly conflicted with St. Paul’s separation ordinance and threatened vital community-policing initiatives, including the city’s Downtown Homelessness Initiative,” Olson said.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-jea-21-PROTEST-0405.jpg?w=1024&h=657,N,,2025-11-27 22:56:26.458972

Both Oregon State Police and State Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, told KGW there are no known plans for ICE or other federal agents to conduct these operations.

Ruiz said he has been working for weeks to counter misinformation about immigration activity in his district, especially because there are verified enforcement missions and detainments reported to his office daily.

“We’ve seen kind of a steady operation of ICE agents being around our area. There’s no question that they’re here,” Ruiz said. “These are really tough times, very difficult times. But it is really important to verify with confirmed organizations that are doing this work on the ground.”

The roadblock rumor, alleging agents were preparing checkpoints on Interstate 5, Highway 26 and Interstate 84 spread quickly over the last couple of days. Ruiz said there is no verified information supporting those claims.

“There hasn’t been and there continues to be no verified or confirmed information regarding that,” he said. “If there were something like this to happen, someone within the state, the city or the county would know about this. And right now, there’s no indication of anything like this happening.”

Ruiz also took to his own social media accounts to urge residents to avoid spreading unverified posts that can fuel fear.
